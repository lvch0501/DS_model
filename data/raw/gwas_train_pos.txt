15761122	Complement factor H polymorphism in age-related macular degeneration.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in the elderly. We report a genome-wide screen of 96 cases and 50 controls for polymorphisms associated with AMD. Among 116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped, an intronic and common variant in the complement factor H gene (CFH) is strongly associated with AMD (nominal P value <10(-7)). In individuals homozygous for the risk allele, the likelihood of AMD is increased by a factor of 7.4 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 19). Resequencing revealed a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the risk allele representing a tyrosine-histidine change at amino acid 402. This polymorphism is in a region of CFH that binds heparin and C-reactive protein. The CFH gene is located on chromosome 1 in a region repeatedly linked to AMD in family-based studies.	 12107410 12426569 12610532 12900797 12945014 14522582 14566334 14570714 14685227 14691731 14871913 14968411 15078675 15094132 15163532 15118848 15168325 15370542 15467524 15514657 2822535 8801636 10783137 10861894 11097601 11450763 11587915 11594942 11846519 12029063
16252231	High-resolution whole-genome association study of Parkinson disease.	We performed a two-tiered, whole-genome association study of Parkinson disease (PD). For tier 1, we individually genotyped 198,345 uniformly spaced and informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 443 sibling pairs discordant for PD. For tier 2a, we individually genotyped 1,793 PD-associated SNPs (P<.01 in tier 1) and 300 genomic control SNPs in 332 matched case-unrelated control pairs. We identified 11 SNPs that were associated with PD (P<.01) in both tier 1 and tier 2 samples and had the same direction of effect. For these SNPs, we combined data from the case-unaffected sibling pair (tier 1) and case-unrelated control pair (tier 2) samples and employed a liberalization of the sibling transmission/disequilibrium test to calculate odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P values. A SNP within the semaphorin 5A gene (SEMA5A) had the lowest combined P value (P=7.62 x 10(-6)). The protein encoded by this gene plays an important role in neurogenesis and in neuronal apoptosis, which is consistent with existing hypotheses regarding PD pathogenesis. A second SNP tagged the PARK11 late-onset PD susceptibility locus (P=1.70 x 10(-5)). In tier 2b, we also selected for genotyping additional SNPs that were borderline significant (P<.05) in tier 1 but that tested a priori biological and genetic hypotheses regarding susceptibility to PD (n=941 SNPs). In analysis of the combined tier 1 and tier 2b data, the two SNPs with the lowest P values (P=9.07 x 10(-6); P=2.96 x 10(-5)) tagged the PARK10 late-onset PD susceptibility locus. Independent replication across populations will clarify the role of the genomic loci tagged by these SNPs in conferring PD susceptibility.	 15514657 14740319 9464278 9560156 9636001 9774100 9792877 10095013 10461885 15541309 15523496 15699365 15716906 15716907 15718463 15732111 15772666 15786467 15761122 15704188 9197268 14681826 12971891 12374768 11072098 10801388 11205158 11315092 11410837 11532993 11543634 11707074 11710889 11721056 11746612 11781119 11875758 11959976 15048890 15066146 15087508 15175754 15218527 15277625 15455403 12402251 12446870 12638082 12666099 12652300 12821380 12883005
16648850	A common genetic variant in the NOS1 regulator NOS1AP modulates cardiac repolarization.	Extremes of the electrocardiographic QT interval, a measure of cardiac repolarization, are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. We identified a common genetic variant influencing this quantitative trait through a genome-wide association study on 200 subjects at the extremes of a population-based QT interval distribution of 3,966 subjects from the KORA cohort in Germany, with follow-up screening of selected markers in the remainder of the cohort. We validated statistically significant findings in two independent samples of 2,646 subjects from Germany and 1,805 subjects from the US Framingham Heart Study. This genome-wide study identified NOS1AP (CAPON), a regulator of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, as a new target that modulates cardiac repolarization. Approximately 60% of subjects of European ancestry carry at least one minor allele of the NOS1AP genetic variant, which explains up to 1.5% of QT interval variation.	
17052657	Genome-wide genotyping in Parkinson's disease and neurologically normal controls: first stage analysis and public release of data.	Several genes underlying rare monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease have been identified over the past decade. Despite evidence for a role for genetics in sporadic Parkinson's disease, few common genetic variants have been unequivocally linked to this disorder. We sought to identify any common genetic variability exerting a large effect in risk for Parkinson's disease in a population cohort and to produce publicly available genome-wide genotype data that can be openly mined by interested researchers and readily augmented by genotyping of additional repository subjects.	
17053108	HTRA1 promoter polymorphism in wet age-related macular degeneration.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in individuals aged older than 50 years, is classified as either wet (neovascular) or dry (nonneovascular). Inherited variation in the complement factor H gene is a major risk factor for drusen in dry AMD. Here we report that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of HTRA1, a serine protease gene on chromosome 10q26, is a major genetic risk factor for wet AMD. A whole-genome association mapping strategy was applied to a Chinese population, yielding a P value of <10(-11). Individuals with the risk-associated genotype were estimated to have a likelihood of developing wet AMD 10 times that of individuals with the wild-type genotype.	
17068223	A genome-wide association study identifies IL23R as an inflammatory bowel disease gene.	The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.	 16290228 14662908 12167685 16473830 16648838 16920909 15070757 11801672 12417590 11390512 16372191 16670770 11385577 17006459 12952918 15168363 15657292 15107849 12023369 12477762 16648837 11586304 11114383 11385576 15537905 12610626 16374252 16107869
17158188	Novel genes identified in a high-density genome wide association study for nicotine dependence.	Tobacco use is a leading contributor to disability and death worldwide, and genetic factors contribute in part to the development of nicotine dependence. To identify novel genes for which natural variation contributes to the development of nicotine dependence, we performed a comprehensive genome wide association study using nicotine dependent smokers as cases and non-dependent smokers as controls. To allow the efficient, rapid, and cost effective screen of the genome, the study was carried out using a two-stage design. In the first stage, genotyping of over 2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was completed in case and control pools. In the second stage, we selected SNPs for individual genotyping based on the most significant allele frequency differences between cases and controls from the pooled results. Individual genotyping was performed in 1050 cases and 879 controls using 31 960 selected SNPs. The primary analysis, a logistic regression model with covariates of age, gender, genotype and gender by genotype interaction, identified 35 SNPs with P-values less than 10(-4) (minimum P-value 1.53 x 10(-6)). Although none of the individual findings is statistically significant after correcting for multiple tests, additional statistical analyses support the existence of true findings in this group. Our study nominates several novel genes, such as Neurexin 1 (NRXN1), in the development of nicotine dependence while also identifying a known candidate gene, the beta3 nicotinic cholinergic receptor. This work anticipates the future directions of large-scale genome wide association studies with state-of-the-art methodological approaches and sharing of data with the scientific community.	 10835412 17081982 10897192 11086367 12150652 12404112 14559775 14679582 14706427 14740319 14975171 14982138 14985398 15075440 15154117 15201841 15211640 15500307 2758152 1932883 1508241 8465673 9819066 10401514 15520358 15718463 15759211 15790597 15988406 15972814 16091475 16148052 16280969 16337695 16415888 16671072 10857247
17293876	A genome-wide association study identifies novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from the interaction of environmental factors with a combination of genetic variants, most of which were hitherto unknown. A systematic search for these variants was recently made possible by the development of high-density arrays that permit the genotyping of hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. We tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case-control cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing beta-cells, and two linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in beta-cell development or function (IDE-KIF11-HHEX and EXT2-ALX4). These associations explain a substantial portion of disease risk and constitute proof of principle for the genome-wide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic traits.	
17362836	Genome-wide genotyping in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neurologically normal controls: first stage analysis and public release of data.	The cause of sporadic ALS is currently unknown. Despite evidence for a role for genetics, no common genetic variants have been unequivocally linked to sporadic ALS. We sought to identify genetic variants associated with an increased or decreased risk for developing ALS in a cohort of American sporadic cases.	
17447842	Novel Crohn disease locus identified by genome-wide association maps to a gene desert on 5p13.1 and modulates expression of PTGER4.	To identify novel susceptibility loci for Crohn disease (CD), we undertook a genome-wide association study with more than 300,000 SNPs characterized in 547 patients and 928 controls. We found three chromosome regions that provided evidence of disease association with p-values between 10(-6) and 10(-9). Two of these (IL23R on Chromosome 1 and CARD15 on Chromosome 16) correspond to genes previously reported to be associated with CD. In addition, a 250-kb region of Chromosome 5p13.1 was found to contain multiple markers with strongly suggestive evidence of disease association (including four markers with p < 10(-7)). We replicated the results for 5p13.1 by studying 1,266 additional CD patients, 559 additional controls, and 428 trios. Significant evidence of association (p < 4 x 10(-4)) was found in case/control comparisons with the replication data, while associated alleles were over-transmitted to affected offspring (p < 0.05), thus confirming that the 5p13.1 locus contributes to CD susceptibility. The CD-associated 250-kb region was saturated with 111 SNP markers. Haplotype analysis supports a complex locus architecture with multiple variants contributing to disease susceptibility. The novel 5p13.1 CD locus is contained within a 1.25-Mb gene desert. We present evidence that disease-associated alleles correlate with quantitative expression levels of the prostaglandin receptor EP4, PTGER4, the gene that resides closest to the associated region. Our results identify a major new susceptibility locus for CD, and suggest that genetic variants associated with disease risk at this locus could modulate cis-acting regulatory elements of PTGER4.	 6361290 17068223 17200669 12538238 16024819 15489855 11927615 10607616 16354752 11731797 15107849 15861209 15838508 11385576 15107852 11254454 16221758 12111667 12925520
17522711	Converging evidence for a pseudoautosomal cytokine receptor gene locus in schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is a strongly heritable disorder, and identification of potential candidate genes has accelerated in recent years. Genomewide scans have identified multiple large linkage regions across the genome, with fine-mapping studies and other investigations of biologically plausible targets demonstrating several promising candidate genes of modest effect. The recent introduction of technological platforms for whole-genome association (WGA) studies can provide an opportunity to rapidly identify novel targets, although no WGA studies have been reported in the psychiatric literature to date. We report results of a case-control WGA study in schizophrenia, examining approximately 500 000 markers, which revealed a strong effect (P=3.7 x 10(-7)) of a novel locus (rs4129148) near the CSF2RA (colony stimulating factor, receptor 2 alpha) gene in the pseudoautosomal region. Sequencing of CSF2RA and its neighbor, IL3RA (interleukin 3 receptor alpha) in an independent case-control cohort revealed both common intronic haplotypes and several novel, rare missense variants associated with schizophrenia. The presence of cytokine receptor abnormalities in schizophrenia may help explain prior epidemiologic data relating the risk for this illness to altered rates of autoimmune disorders, prenatal infection and familial leukemia.	
17401366	Genome-wide association study identifies a second prostate cancer susceptibility variant at 8q24.	Prostate cancer is the most prevalent noncutaneous cancer in males in developed regions, with African American men having among the highest worldwide incidence and mortality rates. Here we report a second genetic variant in the 8q24 region that, in conjunction with another variant we recently discovered, accounts for about 11%-13% of prostate cancer cases in individuals of European descent and 31% of cases in African Americans. We made the current discovery through a genome-wide association scan of 1,453 affected Icelandic individuals and 3,064 controls using the Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChip followed by four replication studies. A key step in the discovery was the construction of a 14-SNP haplotype that efficiently tags a relatively uncommon (2%-4%) susceptibility variant in individuals of European descent that happens to be very common (approximately 42%) in African Americans. The newly identified variant shows a stronger association with affected individuals who have an earlier age at diagnosis.	
17401363	Genome-wide association study of prostate cancer identifies a second risk locus at 8q24.	Recently, common variants on human chromosome 8q24 were found to be associated with prostate cancer risk. While conducting a genome-wide association study in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility project with 550,000 SNPs in a nested case-control study (1,172 cases and 1,157 controls of European origin), we identified a new association at 8q24 with an independent effect on prostate cancer susceptibility. The most significant signal is 70 kb centromeric to the previously reported SNP, rs1447295, but shows little evidence of linkage disequilibrium with it. A combined analysis with four additional studies (total: 4,296 cases and 4,299 controls) confirms association with prostate cancer for rs6983267 in the centromeric locus (P = 9.42 x 10(-13); heterozygote odds ratio (OR): 1.26, 95% confidence interval (c.i.): 1.13-1.41; homozygote OR: 1.58, 95% c.i.: 1.40-1.78). Each SNP remained significant in a joint analysis after adjusting for the other (rs1447295 P = 1.41 x 10(-11); rs6983267 P = 6.62 x 10(-10)). These observations, combined with compelling evidence for a recombination hotspot between the two markers, indicate the presence of at least two independent loci within 8q24 that contribute to prostate cancer in men of European ancestry. We estimate that the population attributable risk of the new locus, marked by rs6983267, is higher than the locus marked by rs1447295 (21% versus 9%).	
17395743	Identification of PVT1 as a candidate gene for <e1> end-stage renal disease </e1> in type 2 diabetes using a pooling-based genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism association study.	To identify genetic variants contributing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pools of 105 unrelated case subjects with ESRD and 102 unrelated control subjects who have had type 2 diabetes for > or =10 years without macroalbuminuria. Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200-kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs showing substantial differences in allelic frequency between case and control pools. These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence for association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96]), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1. We sequenced all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented nonredundant markers with minor allele frequency > or =0.05. We subsequently genotyped these 11 variants and an additional 87 SNPs identified through public databases in 319-kb flanking rs2720709 ( approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01. The strongest evidence for association was found for <e2> rs2648875 </e2> (P = <e3> 0.0000018 </e3>; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which maps to intron 8 of PVT1. Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to ESRD susceptibility in diabetes.
17474819	A high-density whole-genome association study reveals that APOE is the major susceptibility gene for sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease.	While the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon allele is a well-established risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), initial genome scans using microsatellite markers in late-onset AD failed to identify this locus on chromosome 19. Recently developed methods for the simultaneous assessment of hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) promise to help more precisely identify loci that contribute to the risk of AD and other common multigenic conditions. We sought here to demonstrate that more precise identification of loci that are associated with complex, multi-genic genetic disorders can be achieved using ultra-high-density whole-genome associations by demonstrating their ability to identify the APOE locus as a major susceptibility gene for late-onset AD, despite the absence of SNPs within the APOE locus itself, as well as to refine odds ratios (ORs) based on gold-standard phenotyping of the study population.	
17434869	A common variant in the FTO gene is associated with body mass index and predisposes to childhood and adult obesity.	Obesity is a serious international health problem that increases the risk of several common diseases. The genetic factors predisposing to obesity are poorly understood. A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes-susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16% of adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7 years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass.	 16614226 16862161 17065358 17122358 16731858 15096099 7956835 9519560 16025115 16595758 12958120 12508255 11956760
17435756	Genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for Crohn disease and implicates autophagy in disease pathogenesis.	We present a genome-wide association study of ileal Crohn disease and two independent replication studies that identify several new regions of association to Crohn disease. Specifically, in addition to the previously established CARD15 and IL23R associations, we identified strong and significantly replicated associations (combined P < 10(-10)) with an intergenic region on 10q21.1 and a coding variant in ATG16L1, the latter of which was also recently reported by another group. We also report strong associations with independent replication to variation in the genomic regions encoding PHOX2B, NCF4 and a predicted gene on 16q24.1 (FAM92B). Finally, we demonstrate that ATG16L1 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cell lines and that functional knockdown of this gene abrogates autophagy of Salmonella typhimurium. Together, these findings suggest that autophagy and host cell responses to intracellular microbes are involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn disease.	 16144830 16099218 16874021 16880254 16880255 16888103 17000866 17015674 17068223 17182262 17190837 17200669 17213842 17272685 11262732 11385576 11385577 11485746 11586304 11897782 12100889 12167685 12483691 12806610 12960326 15124021 15168363 15290928 3396969 8555939 8780559 8839867 10360575 15528445 15571588 10880437 11060023 15716907 15834410 15931210 15894616 16495224
17463246	Genome-wide association analysis identifies loci for type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels.	New strategies for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) require improved insight into disease etiology. We analyzed 386,731 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1464 patients with T2D and 1467 matched controls, each characterized for measures of glucose metabolism, lipids, obesity, and blood pressure. With collaborators (FUSION and WTCCC/UKT2D), we identified and confirmed three loci associated with T2D-in a noncoding region near CDKN2A and CDKN2B, in an intron of IGF2BP2, and an intron of CDKAL1-and replicated associations near HHEX and in SLC30A8 found by a recent whole-genome association study. We identified and confirmed association of a SNP in an intron of glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) with serum triglycerides. The discovery of associated variants in unsuspected genes and outside coding regions illustrates the ability of genome-wide association studies to provide potentially important clues to the pathogenesis of common diseases.	
17460697	A variant in CDKAL1 influences insulin response and risk of type 2 diabetes.	We conducted a genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Icelandic cases and controls, and we found that a previously described variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) gene conferred the most significant risk. In addition to confirming two recently identified risk variants, we identified a variant in the CDKAL1 gene that was associated with T2D in individuals of European ancestry (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.27), P = 7.7 x 10(-9)) and individuals from Hong Kong of Han Chinese ancestry (OR = 1.25 (1.11-1.40), P = 0.00018). The genotype OR of this variant suggested that the effect was substantially stronger in homozygous carriers than in heterozygous carriers. The ORs for homozygotes were 1.50 (1.31-1.72) and 1.55 (1.23-1.95) in the European and Hong Kong groups, respectively. The insulin response for homozygotes was approximately 20% lower than for heterozygotes or noncarriers, suggesting that this variant confers risk of T2D through reduced insulin secretion.	
17463249	Replication of genome-wide association signals in UK samples reveals risk loci for type 2 diabetes.	The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood. Starting from genome-wide genotype data for 1924 diabetic cases and 2938 population controls generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, we set out to detect replicated diabetes association signals through analysis of 3757 additional cases and 5346 controls and by integration of our findings with equivalent data from other international consortia. We detected diabetes susceptibility loci in and around the genes CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and IGF2BP2 and confirmed the recently described associations at HHEX/IDE and SLC30A8. Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of multiple variants of modest effect. The regions identified underscore the importance of pathways influencing pancreatic beta cell development and function in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.	 10958757 17293876 10973253 12540637 14627982 14736744 15039230 15060014 15298346 9070242 10319860 15201180 15607541 15687261 15823385 16155576 16224025 16415884 16887799 16957737
17463248	A genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in Finns detects multiple susceptibility variants.	Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10.	 10973253 17463249 11882646 12540637 14736744 14988269 15111519 14976144 15331542 2227105 1473616 9614613 9806549 9891060 10319860 10490638 16158220 16155576 16255080 16305061 16415884 16887799 16984975 17055429 17293876 17434869 17463246 11315092
17478679	A common variant on chromosome 9p21 affects the risk of myocardial infarction.	The global endemic of cardiovascular diseases calls for improved risk assessment and treatment. Here, we describe an association between myocardial infarction (MI) and a common sequence variant on chromosome 9p21. This study included a total of 4587 cases and 12,767 controls. The identified variant, adjacent to the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B, was associated with the disease with high significance. Approximately 21% of individuals in the population are homozygous for this variant, and their estimated risk of suffering myocardial infarction is 1.64 times as great as that of noncarriers. The corresponding risk is 2.02 times as great for early-onset cases. The population attributable risk is 21% for MI in general and 31% for early-onset cases.	
17434096	A genome-wide genotyping study in patients with ischaemic stroke: initial analysis and data release.	Despite evidence of a genetic role in stroke, the identification of common genetic risk factors for this devastating disorder remains problematic. We aimed to identify any common genetic variability exerting a moderate to large effect on risk of ischaemic stroke, and to generate publicly available genome-wide genotype data to facilitate others doing the same.	 3465198 3344216 3403500 2728057 1675378 1346420 7678184 7974549 7839396 8610298 8801636 8878478 8978667 15534175 15769776 15789306 15761122 16112838 16252231 16255080 16415888 17052657 17068223 17116639 17474819 11248242 10973969 10960044 10734076 3335877 11805342 11847232 12444190 12426569 12930761 14517540 12848902 14685227 14770184 15194251 4333982 46957 1202204 6086497 3719049
17486107	A genome-wide association study implicates diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH) and several other genes in the etiology of bipolar disorder.	The genetic basis of bipolar disorder has long been thought to be complex, with the potential involvement of multiple genes, but methods to analyze populations with respect to this complexity have only recently become available. We have carried out a genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder by genotyping over 550,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two independent case-control samples of European origin. The initial association screen was performed using pooled DNA, and selected SNPs were confirmed by individual genotyping. While DNA pooling reduces power to detect genetic associations, there is a substantial cost saving and gain in efficiency. A total of 88 SNPs, representing 80 different genes, met the prior criteria for replication in both samples. Effect sizes were modest: no single SNP of large effect was detected. Of 37 SNPs selected for individual genotyping, the strongest association signal was detected at a marker within the first intron of diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH; P=1.5 x 10(-8), experiment-wide P<0.01, OR=1.59). This gene encodes DGKH, a key protein in the lithium-sensitive phosphatidyl inositol pathway. This first genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder shows that several genes, each of modest effect, reproducibly influence disease risk. Bipolar disorder may be a polygenic disease.	 17047687 11315092 17171570 6056557 3264568 16194763 10450272 16581030 10835412 2674489 17159887 16713569 14966477 16251455 15947021 12042799 12499305 12916020 11524377 12490454 162486 15614721 15119834 2200070 17008307 16800000 15812168 16987892 12498692 16604061 11741836 12802785 7103676 17225249 11165493 3432746 12485472 16380905 12415316 8801636 16400608 2003164 17003564 15691525 12833159 11986984 7944874 8630499 16983374 19990758 17160900
17529967	Genome-wide association study identifies novel breast cancer susceptibility loci.	Breast cancer exhibits familial aggregation, consistent with variation in genetic susceptibility to the disease. Known susceptibility genes account for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and the residual genetic variance is likely to be due to variants conferring more moderate risks. To identify further susceptibility alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in 4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third stage in which 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for confirmation in 21,860 cases and 22,578 controls from 22 studies. We used 227,876 SNPs that were estimated to correlate with 77% of known common SNPs in Europeans at r2 > 0.5. SNPs in five novel independent loci exhibited strong and consistent evidence of association with breast cancer (P < 10(-7)). Four of these contain plausible causative genes (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1). At the second stage, 1,792 SNPs were significant at the P < 0.05 level compared with an estimated 1,343 that would be expected by chance, indicating that many additional common susceptibility alleles may be identifiable by this approach.	 11959976 11967536 11984562 12677558 14557987 15122511 15381934 11890312 11791212 11752248 11705483 11325814 11315092 11250676 11242096 1851551 7545954 8524414 10466767 15561780 15718463 15928302 16000320 16080110 16255080 16244653 16575876 16682969 16832357 17018785 16986161 17033622 17148480 17200668 17293864 17344846 17287723 17401363 17401366
17529973	A genome-wide association study identifies alleles in FGFR2 associated with risk of sporadic postmenopausal breast cancer.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer by genotyping 528,173 SNPs in 1,145 postmenopausal women of European ancestry with invasive breast cancer and 1,142 controls. We identified four SNPs in intron 2 of FGFR2 (which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase and is amplified or overexpressed in some breast cancers) that were highly associated with breast cancer and confirmed this association in 1,776 affected individuals and 2,072 controls from three additional studies. Across the four studies, the association with all four SNPs was highly statistically significant (P(trend) for the most strongly associated SNP (rs1219648) = 1.1 x 10(-10); population attributable risk = 16%). Four SNPs at other loci most strongly associated with breast cancer in the initial GWAS were not associated in the replication studies. Our summary results from the GWAS are available online in a form that should speed the identification of additional risk loci.	 11189687 17529967 17194218 11984562 12677558 12930761 4050778 15716906 15637718 15863033 16255080 16775186 16607626 16862161 17033967 17148771 17133345 17220346 17293876 17372279 17401366 17407163 11092437
17529974	Common variants on chromosomes 2q35 and 16q12 confer susceptibility to estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.	Familial clustering studies indicate that breast cancer risk has a substantial genetic component. To identify new breast cancer risk variants, we genotyped approximately 300,000 SNPs in 1,600 Icelandic individuals with breast cancer and 11,563 controls using the Illumina Hap300 platform. We then tested selected SNPs in five replication sample sets. Overall, we studied 4,554 affected individuals and 17,577 controls. Two SNPs consistently associated with breast cancer: approximately 25% of individuals of European descent are homozygous for allele A of rs13387042 on chromosome 2q35 and have an estimated 1.44-fold greater risk than noncarriers, and for allele T of rs3803662 on 16q12, about 7% are homozygous and have a 1.64-fold greater risk. Risk from both alleles was confined to estrogen receptor-positive tumors. At present, no genes have been identified in the linkage disequilibrium block containing rs13387042. rs3803662 is near the 5' end of TNRC9 , a high mobility group chromatin-associated protein whose expression is implicated in breast cancer metastasis to bone.	
17554261	Sequence variants in the autophagy gene IRGM and multiple other replicating loci contribute to Crohn's disease susceptibility.	A genome-wide association scan in individuals with Crohn's disease by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium detected strong association at four novel loci. We tested 37 SNPs from these and other loci for association in an independent case-control sample. We obtained replication for the autophagy-inducing IRGM gene on chromosome 5q33.1 (replication P = 6.6 x 10(-4), combined P = 2.1 x 10(-10)) and for nine other loci, including NKX2-3, PTPN2 and gene deserts on chromosomes 1q and 5p13.	 16277747 17447842 11385576 11385577 11457893 11586304 15483662 10790368 16888103 17068223 17236132 17200669 17435756
17554260	Robust associations of four new chromosome regions from genome-wide analyses of type 1 diabetes.	The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) primary genome-wide association (GWA) scan on seven diseases, including the multifactorial autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D), shows associations at P < 5 x 10(-7) between T1D and six chromosome regions: 12q24, 12q13, 16p13, 18p11, 12p13 and 4q27. Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 individuals with T1D, 5,000 controls and 2,997 family trios independent of the WTCCC study. We confirmed unequivocally the associations of 12q24, 12q13, 16p13 and 18p11 (P(follow-up) <or= 1.35 x 10(-9); P(overall) <or= 1.15 x 10(-14)), leaving eight regions with small effects or false-positive associations. We also obtained evidence for chromosome 18q22 (P(overall) = 1.38 x 10(-8)) from a GWA study of nonsynonymous SNPs. Several regions, including 18q22 and 18p11, showed association with autoimmune thyroid disease. This study increases the number of T1D loci with compelling evidence from six to at least ten.	 12724780 12663480 15114531 15029236 15504986 1838040 15687290 15716907 15776395 16034094 16255080 16228001 16336259 16273093 16625202 16699517 16625214 16697661 16804532 17169983 17277778 17371467 17483596 17511519 17554300 14614235 11719900 11823787 12138178
17554300	Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls.	There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.	 8626375 8818369 8966556 9096364 9524771 15539621 15626768 15630428 15640425 15702615 16862161 16936215 15716906 15711544 15744031 15782172 15793588 15776395 15823385 15657097 15863738 15939841 15888480 15983262 15928901 16175504 16043441 16171773 16255080 16228001 16221758 16301342 16380912 16282974 16388065 16267090 16155052 16481629 16462853 16415884 16631883 16699517 12826435 12930761 12937168 14704198 14717650 14735120 14770184 14764624 15026468 17096114 17447842 17460697 17463246 17463248 17463249 17554260 17554261 17572673 17255346 16887799 10580439 10790368 10835412 10947210 10973253 11101483 1883262 8055200 8078588 7921761 7983640 7647779 16888103 16987874 17003358 16756480 17068223 17200669 17206141 17293876 17277778 17371467 17435756 17170052 17434869 11126361 11254450 11315092 11385576 11385577 11403745 11443544 11484155 11586304 11742409 11812578 11920398 11986998 12140780 12387655 12506198 12540637 12524541 12573439 12642066 12663480 12742871 15154113 15166010 15297675 15208781 15336975 15364185 15485348 15504986 655775 356262 3579495 2446635 3358796 16715099 16778047 16804532 15044291 15004560 15114531 3396969 2617184 2190539 2380170 2059076 16819502 16845271 16832355
17553421	GAB2 alleles modify Alzheimer's risk in APOE epsilon4 carriers.	The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the best established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We conducted genome-wide surveys of 502,627 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to characterize and confirm other LOAD susceptibility genes. In epsilon4 carriers from neuropathologically verified discovery, neuropathologically verified replication, and clinically characterized replication cohorts of 1411 cases and controls, LOAD was associated with six SNPs from the GRB-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) gene and a common haplotype encompassing the entire GAB2 gene. SNP rs2373115 (p = 9 x 10(-11)) was associated with an odds ratio of 4.06 (confidence interval 2.81-14.69), which interacts with APOE epsilon4 to further modify risk. GAB2 was overexpressed in pathologically vulnerable neurons; the Gab2 protein was detected in neurons, tangle-bearing neurons, and dystrophic neuritis; and interference with GAB2 gene expression increased tau phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that GAB2 modifies LOAD risk in APOE epsilon4 carriers and influences Alzheimer's neuropathology.	 10670438 17474819 10835412 11035047 11449275 12008033 15212823 15192701 15240750 2810583 1759558 8346443 7920638 8592548 9343467 9806827 10227624 10369254 15492223 15932949 16120771 16014629 16255080 16461860 16669732 16894106 16226349 17062589 17192785 17151600 17077275 10805527

17668382	Type 2 diabetes whole-genome association study in four populations: the DiaGen consortium.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common, polygenic chronic disease with high heritability. The purpose of this whole-genome association study was to discover novel T2D-associated genes. We genotyped 500 familial cases and 497 controls with >300,000 HapMap-derived tagging single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) markers. When a stringent statistical correction for multiple testing was used, the only significant SNP was at TCF7L2, which has already been discovered and confirmed as a T2D-susceptibility gene. For a replication study, we selected 10 SNPs in six chromosomal regions with the strongest association (singly or as part of a haplotype) for retesting in an independent case-control set including 2,573 T2D cases and 2,776 controls. The most significant replicated result was found at the AHI1-LOC441171 gene region.	 17187677 17012270 18252159 10848493 10973253 11256992 11814058 12468793 12540637 12728642 14693720 14992496 15467982 1679985 8927780 9758619 15715885 15716907 15842505 15931378 16244321 16415884 16619052 16837224 16936162 16983374 17003358 17293876
17603472	Variants conferring risk of atrial fibrillation on chromosome 4q25.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is characterized by chaotic electrical activity of the atria. It affects one in ten individuals over the age of 80 years, causes significant morbidity and is an independent predictor of mortality. Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF. Mutations in potassium-channel genes have been associated with familial AF but account for only a small fraction of all cases of AF. We have performed a genome-wide association scan, followed by replication studies in three populations of European descent and a Chinese population from Hong Kong and find a strong association between two sequence variants on chromosome 4q25 and AF. Here we show that about 35% of individuals of European descent have at least one of the variants and that the risk of AF increases by 1.72 and 1.39 per copy. The association with the stronger variant is replicated in the Chinese population, where it is carried by 75% of individuals and the risk of AF is increased by 1.42 per copy. A stronger association was observed in individuals with typical atrial flutter. Both variants are adjacent to PITX2, which is known to have a critical function in left-right asymmetry of the heart.	
17603485	Two variants on chromosome 17 confer prostate cancer risk, and the one in TCF2 protects against type 2 diabetes.	We performed a genome-wide association scan to search for sequence variants conferring risk of prostate cancer using 1,501 Icelandic men with prostate cancer and 11,290 controls. Follow-up studies involving three additional case-control groups replicated an association of two variants on chromosome 17 with the disease. These two variants, 33 Mb apart, fall within a region previously implicated by family-based linkage studies on prostate cancer. The risks conferred by these variants are moderate individually (allele odds ratio of about 1.20), but because they are common, their joint population attributable risk is substantial. One of the variants is in TCF2 (HNF1beta), a gene known to be mutated in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5. Results from eight case-control groups, including one West African and one Chinese, demonstrate that this variant confers protection against type 2 diabetes.	
17618284	A genome-wide association scan of tag SNPs identifies a susceptibility variant for colorectal cancer at 8q24.21.	Much of the variation in inherited risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is probably due to combinations of common low risk variants. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 550,000 tag SNPs in 930 familial colorectal tumor cases and 960 controls. The most strongly associated SNP (P = 1.72 x 10(-7), allelic test) was rs6983267 at 8q24.21. To validate this finding, we genotyped rs6983267 in three additional CRC case-control series (4,361 affected individuals and 3,752 controls; 1,901 affected individuals and 1,079 controls; 1,072 affected individuals and 415 controls) and replicated the association, providing P = 1.27 x 10(-14) (allelic test) overall, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.27 (95% confidence interval (c.i.): 1.16-1.39) and 1.47 (95% c.i.: 1.34-1.62) for heterozygotes and rare homozygotes, respectively. Analyses based on 1,477 individuals with colorectal adenoma and 2,136 controls suggest that susceptibility to CRC is mediated through development of adenomas (OR = 1.21, 95% c.i.: 1.10-1.34; P = 6.89 x 10(-5)). These data show that common, low-penetrance susceptibility alleles predispose to colorectal neoplasia.	
17618283	Genome-wide association scan identifies a colorectal cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 8q24.	Using a multistage genetic association approach comprising 7,480 affected individuals and 7,779 controls, we identified markers in chromosomal region 8q24 associated with colorectal cancer. In stage 1, we genotyped 99,632 SNPs in 1,257 affected individuals and 1,336 controls from Ontario. In stages 2-4, we performed serial replication studies using 4,024 affected individuals and 4,042 controls from Seattle, Newfoundland and Scotland. We identified one locus on chromosome 8q24 and another on 9p24 having combined odds ratios (OR) for stages 1-4 of 1.18 (trend; P = 1.41 x 10(-8)) and 1.14 (trend; P = 1.32 x 10(-5)), respectively. Additional analyses in 2,199 affected individuals and 2,401 controls from France and Europe supported the association at the 8q24 locus (OR = 1.16, trend; 95% confidence interval (c.i.): 1.07-1.26; P = 5.05 x 10(-4)). A summary across all seven studies at the 8q24 locus was highly significant (OR = 1.17, c.i.: 1.12-1.23; P = 3.16 x 10(-11)). This locus has also been implicated in prostate cancer.	
17637780	Genome-wide association study of restless legs syndrome identifies common variants in three genomic regions.	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological disorder characterized by an imperative urge to move the legs during night, unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs, disturbed sleep and increased cardiovascular morbidity. In a genome-wide association study we found highly significant associations between RLS and intronic variants in the homeobox gene MEIS1, the BTBD9 gene encoding a BTB(POZ) domain as well as variants in a third locus containing the genes encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP2K5 and the transcription factor LBXCOR1 on chromosomes 2p, 6p and 15q, respectively. Two independent replications confirmed these association signals. Each genetic variant was associated with a more than 50% increase in risk for RLS, with the combined allelic variants conferring more than half of the risk. MEIS1 has been implicated in limb development, raising the possibility that RLS has components of a developmental disorder.	
17634447	A genetic risk factor for periodic limb movements in sleep.	The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs. It is a major cause of sleep disruption. Periodic limb movements in sleep are detectable in most patients with RLS and represent an objective physiological metric.	
17658951	Genome-wide association scan shows genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with obesity-related traits.	The obesity epidemic is responsible for a substantial economic burden in developed countries and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the FTO and PFKP genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the FTO gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI (p = 8.6 x10(-7)), hip circumference (p = 3.4 x 10(-8)), and weight (p = 9.1 x 10(-7)). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare "G" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "A" allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI (p = 4.9 x 10(-6)). Homozygotes for the rare "A" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "G" allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans (N = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans (N = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI (p-value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples, p = 0.001), weight (p = 0.001), and hip circumference (p = 0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare "A" allele were, on average, 1.0-3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common "G" allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome-association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population.	 11731797 15919810 11923912 12075568 12559684 8576637 9545015 9603719 9603720 9683310 9915965 10432905 10511607 10501967 15557412 15716906 12524541 12610532 14649376 14975159 15075390 6227585 3470801 1301996 15789306 15983228 15947021 16255080 16449729 16595758 16648850 16741264 16926275 16921375 16934002 17068223 17293876 17434869 17496892 17924335 10546691 10581024 10631157 10842743 10999840 11252747 11315092 11331618 11742409 15716907 8022039 15716112 15761122 11949936
17611496	Genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression contribute to the risk of childhood asthma.	Asthma is caused by a combination of poorly understood genetic and environmental factors. We have systematically mapped the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the presence of childhood onset asthma by genome-wide association. We characterized more than 317,000 SNPs in DNA from 994 patients with childhood onset asthma and 1,243 non-asthmatics, using family and case-referent panels. Here we show multiple markers on chromosome 17q21 to be strongly and reproducibly associated with childhood onset asthma in family and case-referent panels with a combined P value of P < 10(-12). In independent replication studies the 17q21 locus showed strong association with diagnosis of childhood asthma in 2,320 subjects from a cohort of German children (P = 0.0003) and in 3,301 subjects from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (P = 0.0005). We systematically evaluated the relationships between markers of the 17q21 locus and transcript levels of genes in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children in the asthma family panel used in our association study. The SNPs associated with childhood asthma were consistently and strongly associated (P < 10(-22)) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results indicate that genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma.	
17667963	A whole genome association study of neuroticism using DNA pooling.	We describe a multistage approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with neuroticism, a personality trait that shares genetic determinants with major depression and anxiety disorders. Whole genome association with 452 574 SNPs was performed on DNA pools from approximately 2000 individuals selected on extremes of neuroticism scores from a cohort of 88 142 people from southwest England. The most significant SNPs were then genotyped on independent samples to replicate findings. We were able to replicate association of one SNP within the PDE4D gene in a second sample collected by our laboratory and in a family-based test in an independent sample; however, the SNP was not significantly associated with neuroticism in two other independent samples. We also observed an enrichment of low P-values in known regions of copy number variations. Simulation indicates that our study had approximately 80% power to identify neuroticism loci in the genome with odds ratio (OR)>2, and approximately 50% power to identify small effects (OR=1.5). Since we failed to find any loci accounting for more than 1% of the variance, the heritability of neuroticism probably arises from many loci each explaining much less than 1%. Our findings argue the need for much larger samples than anticipated in genetic association studies and that the biological basis of emotional disorders is extremely complex.	 12612864 12482934 14744527 15319578 15351774 15390211 6544237 3780193 2649038 2138276 2065693 1888956 1475038 8215811 8190638 7896115 15606997 15543638 9655498 15389754 15811185 15800012 16100406 16023085 16255080 16043130 16354503 16390898 16189510 16434481 16478714 16611464 16627870 16648327 16718280 16688731 16360306 16893921 17015813 17015230 17008408 17053149 17122850 16480507 12815733 11463151 11463152 11463154 11791212 12023322 12091191 12121997 12377395 12415316 12402217 12485472 12490144 12475937
17684544	Systematic association mapping identifies NELL1 as a novel IBD disease gene.	Crohn disease (CD), a sub-entity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a complex polygenic disorder. Although recent studies have successfully identified CD-associated genetic variants, these susceptibility loci explain only a fraction of the heritability of the disease. Here, we report on a multi-stage genome-wide scan of 393 German CD cases and 399 controls. Among the 116,161 single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested, an association with the known CD susceptibility gene NOD2, the 5q31 haplotype, and the recently reported CD locus at 5p13.1 was confirmed. In addition, SNP rs1793004 in the gene encoding nel-like 1 precursor (NELL1, chromosome 11p15.1) showed a consistent disease-association in independent German population- and family-based samples (942 cases, 1082 controls, 375 trios). Subsequent fine mapping and replication in an independent sample of 454 French/Canadian CD trios supported the authenticity of the NELL1 association. Further confirmation in a large German ulcerative colitis (UC) sample indicated that NELL1 is a ubiquitous IBD susceptibility locus (combined p<10(-6); OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.30-2.11). The novel 5p13.1 locus was also replicated in the French/Canadian sample and in an independent UK CD patient panel (453 cases, 521 controls, combined p<10(-6) for SNP rs1992660). Several associations were replicated in at least one independent sample, point to an involvement of ITGB6 (upstream), GRM8 (downstream), OR5V1 (downstream), PPP3R2 (downstream), NM_152575 (upstream) and HNF4G (intron).	 12529700 12916020 14574645 14752704 15107849 15107852 15168363 1269986 3583068 3396969 2705471 17200669 17307543 17156146 17322881 17435756 17484864 17447842 17554300 17554261 17455206 17476680 2617184 1984188 2007623 8447318 7835582 7542656 7655083 7655175 8555939 8906426 10053016 10231576 15514103 15503241 15297300 15741513 15782172 15861209 15790594 15841097 15843420 15955786 16228001 16221758 16285943 16344053 16407063 16490960 16446977 16450402 16537572 16633048 16652332 16715099 16710477 16680197 16773680 16835882 17003564 17068223 10548494 10600492 10861894 11102749 11385576 11385577 11425413 11448884 11452081 11586304 11994493 12020527 12235118
17690259	Common sequence variants in the LOXL1 gene confer susceptibility to exfoliation glaucoma.	Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. A genome-wide search yielded multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15q24.1 region associated with glaucoma. Further investigation revealed that the association is confined to exfoliation glaucoma (XFG). Two nonsynonymous SNPs in exon 1 of the gene LOXL1 explain the association, and the data suggest that they confer risk of XFG mainly through exfoliation syndrome (XFS). About 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest-risk haplotype, and their risk of suffering from XFG is more than 100 times that of individuals carrying only low-risk haplotypes. The population-attributable risk is more than 99%. The product of LOXL1 catalyzes the formation of elastin fibers found to be a major component of the lesions in XFG.	
17767159	A QTL influencing F cell production maps to a gene encoding a zinc-finger protein on chromosome 2p15.	F cells measure the presence of fetal hemoglobin, a heritable quantitative trait in adults that accounts for substantial phenotypic diversity of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We applied a genome-wide association mapping strategy to individuals with contrasting extreme trait values and mapped a new F cell quantitative trait locus to BCL11A, which encodes a zinc-finger protein, on chromosome 2p15. The 2p15 BCL11A quantitative trait locus accounts for 15.1% of the trait variance.	
17767157	A common variant of HMGA2 is associated with adult and childhood height in the general population.	Human height is a classic, highly heritable quantitative trait. To begin to identify genetic variants influencing height, we examined genome-wide association data from 4,921 individuals. Common variants in the HMGA2 oncogene, exemplified by rs1042725, were associated with height (P = 4 x 10(-8)). HMGA2 is also a strong biological candidate for height, as rare, severe mutations in this gene alter body size in mice and humans, so we tested rs1042725 in additional samples. We confirmed the association in 19,064 adults from four further studies (P = 3 x 10(-11), overall P = 4 x 10(-16), including the genome-wide association data). We also observed the association in children (P = 1 x 10(-6), N = 6,827) and a tall/short case-control study (P = 4 x 10(-6), N = 3,207). We estimate that rs1042725 explains approximately 0.3% of population variation in height (approximately 0.4 cm increased adult height per C allele). There are few examples of common genetic variants reproducibly associated with human quantitativetraits; these results represent, to our knowledge, the first consistently replicated association with adult and childhood height.	 10715741 17701901 10754982 11237119 11315092 12192740 12524541 12958120 14567953 14624724 15298351 7651535 8805046 9703685 10519386 15593017 16041375 16228001 16466435 16862161 17023699 16933140 17189557 17169561 17463246 17463249 17554300 17559308 10750603

Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits.	 11313775 17903291 11731797 11854867 12045153 12519945 7188949 6499693 2919564 2040041 1914093 8465742 8044959 8917269 9535482 9545414 10192228 10226089 10377080 15716906 15761122 15851319 16412861 16415888 16614226 16648850 16715096 17068223 11334841

17999355	A genomewide association study of skin pigmentation in a South Asian population.	We have conducted a multistage genomewide association study, using 1,620,742 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to systematically investigate the genetic factors influencing intrinsic skin pigmentation in a population of South Asian descent. Polymorphisms in three genes--SLC24A5, TYR, and SLC45A2--yielded highly significant replicated associations with skin-reflectance measurements, an indirect measure of melanin content in the skin. The associations detected in these three genes, in an additive manner, collectively account for a large fraction of the natural variation of skin pigmentation in a South Asian population. Our study is the first to interrogate polymorphisms across the genome, to find genetic determinants of the natural variation of skin pigmentation within a human population.	 17194218 17158188 10631149 10835412 10994463 11030758 11181995 11237011 11237013 11315092 11499678 11574907 11602344 11721056 11719900 11916009 11936269 12368253 12579416 12817591 12859616 14616056 14740319 15009725 14551921 675247 7258341 7199888 1970634 7581459 9453695 10364535 17236130 17182896 17233754 17358008 15386260 14204850 15598216 15606997 15718463 15714523 15726415 16255080 16357253 16862161 16757656 17044855 16977434 16847698 17135278 15372380
17952075	Genetic determinants of hair, eye and skin pigmentation in Europeans.	Hair, skin and eye colors are highly heritable and visible traits in humans. We carried out a genome-wide association scan for variants associated with hair and eye pigmentation, skin sensitivity to sun and freckling among 2,986 Icelanders. We then tested the most closely associated SNPs from six regions--four not previously implicated in the normal variation of human pigmentation--and replicated their association in a second sample of 2,718 Icelanders and a sample of 1,214 Dutch. The SNPs from all six regions met the criteria for genome-wide significance. A variant in SLC24A4 is associated with eye and hair color, a variant near KITLG is associated with hair color, two coding variants in TYR are associated with eye color and freckles, and a variant on 6p25.3 is associated with freckles. The fifth region provided refinements to a previously reported association in OCA2, and the sixth encompasses previously described variants in MC1R.	
17975299	Sorl1 as an Alzheimer's disease predisposition gene?	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressively disabling impairments in memory, cognition, and non-cognitive behavioural symptoms. Sporadic AD is multifactorial and genetically complex. While several monogenic mutations cause early-onset AD and gene alleles have been suggested as AD susceptibility factors, the only extensively validated susceptibility gene for late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele. Alleles of the APOE gene do not account for all of the genetic load calculated to be responsible for AD predisposition. Recently, polymorphisms across the neuronal sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) gene were shown to be significantly associated with AD in several cohorts. Here we present the results of our large case-control whole-genome scan at over 500,000 polymorphisms which presents weak evidence for association and potentially narrows the association interval.	
17982456	Two independent alleles at 6q23 associated with risk of rheumatoid arthritis.	To identify susceptibility alleles associated with rheumatoid arthritis, we genotyped 397 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis for 116,204 SNPs and carried out an association analysis in comparison to publicly available genotype data for 1,211 related individuals from the Framingham Heart Study. After evaluating and adjusting for technical and population biases, we identified a SNP at 6q23 (rs10499194, approximately 150 kb from TNFAIP3 and OLIG3) that was reproducibly associated with rheumatoid arthritis both in the genome-wide association (GWA) scan and in 5,541 additional case-control samples (P = 10(-3), GWA scan; P < 10(-6), replication; P = 10(-9), combined). In a concurrent study, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) has reported strong association of rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility to a different SNP located 3.8 kb from rs10499194 (rs6920220; P = 5 x 10(-6) in WTCCC). We show that these two SNP associations are statistically independent, are each reproducible in the comparison of our data and WTCCC data, and define risk and protective haplotypes for rheumatoid arthritis at 6q23.	 17401366 16542499 17701901 11009421 11315092 12110146 12922955 15022313 15052270 15052271 15136663 15208781 2118515 7934491 15769945 16228001 16244653 16320316 16614226 16862161 16936732 17044734 17068223 17118959 17412832 17401363 17401364 17554300

18075462	A novel genetic marker for coronary spasm in women from a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.	Coronary spasm plays an important role in the pathogenesis of variant angina and also ischemic heart diseases in general, and it is more likely to occur in angiographically normal coronary arteries than in stenotic coronary arteries. We previously found a -786T/C polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and reported that this polymorphism is associated with coronary spasm. We report on an investigation of the genetic factor(s) associated with coronary spasm utilizing a genome-wide case-control study.	
18084291	Genetic variation in DPP6 is associated with susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	We identified a SNP in the DPP6 gene that is consistently strongly associated with susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in different populations of European ancestry, with an overall P value of 5.04 x 10(-8) in 1,767 cases and 1,916 healthy controls and with an odds ratio of 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.18-1.43). Our finding is the first report of a genome-wide significant association with sporadic ALS and may be a target for future functional studies.

18179892	Genome-wide association study identifies genes for biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: serum urate and dyslipidemia.	Many common diseases are accompanied by disturbances in biochemical traits. Identifying the genetic determinants could provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and reveal avenues for developing new therapies. Here, we report a genome-wide association analysis for commonly measured serum and urine biochemical traits. As part of the WTCCC, 500,000 SNPs genome wide were genotyped in 1955 hypertensive individuals characterized for 25 serum and urine biochemical traits. For each trait, we assessed association with individual SNPs, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Lipid measurements were further examined in a meta-analysis of genome-wide data from a type 2 diabetes scan. The most promising associations were examined in two epidemiological cohorts. We discovered association between serum urate and SLC2A9, a glucose transporter (p = 2 x 10(-15)) and confirmed this in two independent cohorts, GRAPHIC study (p = 9 x 10(-15)) and TwinsUK (p = 8 x 10(-19)). The odds ratio for hyperuricaemia (defined as urate >0.4 mMol/l) is 1.89 (95% CI = 1.36-2.61) per copy of common allele. We also replicated many genes previously associated with serum lipids and found previously recognized association between LDL levels and SNPs close to genes encoding PSRC1 and CELSR2 (p = 1 x 10(-7)). The common allele was associated with a 6% increase in nonfasting serum LDL. This region showed increased association in the meta-analysis (p = 4 x 10(-14)). This finding provides a potential biological mechanism for the recent association of this same allele of the same SNP with increased risk of coronary disease.	 17463246 17434869 17554300 17554260 17635890 17635891 17310996 17634449 17515402 10618717 10860667 10907856 11754464 11780939 12707287 12826435 12908717 14741909 15026459 15166778 15296698 5125334 4337382 2342536 8901667 10075613 10330363 10401873 10414556 15569852 16253630 16301342 17060508 17254428 17278930 17464972 17483596 17463249
18193044	Six new loci associated with blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides in humans.	Blood concentrations of lipoproteins and lipids are heritable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Using genome-wide association data from three studies (n = 8,816 that included 2,758 individuals from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative specific to the current paper as well as 1,874 individuals from the FUSION study of type 2 diabetes and 4,184 individuals from the SardiNIA study of aging-associated variables reported in a companion paper in this issue) and targeted replication association analyses in up to 18,554 independent participants, we show that common SNPs at 18 loci are reproducibly associated with concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and/or triglycerides. Six of these loci are new (P < 5 x 10(-8) for each new locus). Of the six newly identified chromosomal regions, two were associated with LDL cholesterol (1p13 near CELSR2, PSRC1 and SORT1 and 19p13 near CILP2 and PBX4), one with HDL cholesterol (1q42 in GALNT2) and five with triglycerides (7q11 near TBL2 and MLXIPL, 8q24 near TRIB1, 1q42 in GALNT2, 19p13 near CILP2 and PBX4 and 1p31 near ANGPTL3). At 1p13, the LDL-associated SNP was also strongly correlated with CELSR2, PSRC1, and SORT1 transcript levels in human liver, and a proxy for this SNP was recently shown to affect risk for coronary artery disease. Understanding the molecular, cellular and clinical consequences of the newly identified loci may inform therapy and clinical care.	 10750603 10972367 18193043 11588264 11693972 11788823 15044381 15297675 48701 3985008 4054601 3948246 8429286 9114024 10085125 15520867 13751193 15655129 15992544 16030169 16023652 16465619 16554528 16574898 16890538 17322881 17463246 17634449 17701901
18193046	Genome-wide scan identifies variation in MLXIPL associated with plasma triglycerides.	We tested over 267,000 SNPs in 1,005 Northern Europeans and 248,000 in 1,006 Indian Asians for association with triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, with replication in 10,536 subjects. We found association of a nonsynonymous SNP (rs3812316, G771C, Gln241His) in MLXIPL with plasma triglyceride levels (combined P = 1.4 x 10(-10)). MLXIPL coordinates transcriptional regulation of enzymes that channel glycolytic end-products into lipogenesis and energy storage, making MLXIPL a plausible 'thrifty gene'.	
18193043	Newly identified loci that influence lipid concentrations and risk of coronary artery disease.	To identify genetic variants influencing plasma lipid concentrations, we first used genotype imputation and meta-analysis to combine three genome-wide scans totaling 8,816 individuals and comprising 6,068 individuals specific to our study (1,874 individuals from the FUSION study of type 2 diabetes and 4,184 individuals from the SardiNIA study of aging-associated variables) and 2,758 individuals from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative, reported in a companion study in this issue. We subsequently examined promising signals in 11,569 additional individuals. Overall, we identify strongly associated variants in eleven loci previously implicated in lipid metabolism (ABCA1, the APOA5-APOA4-APOC3-APOA1 and APOE-APOC clusters, APOB, CETP, GCKR, LDLR, LPL, LIPC, LIPG and PCSK9) and also in several newly identified loci (near MVK-MMAB and GALNT2, with variants primarily associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; near SORT1, with variants primarily associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; near TRIB1, MLXIPL and ANGPTL3, with variants primarily associated with triglycerides; and a locus encompassing several genes near NCAN, with variants strongly associated with both triglycerides and LDL cholesterol). Notably, the 11 independent variants associated with increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in our study also showed increased frequency in a sample of coronary artery disease cases versus controls.	 10631157 18193044 17463246 11315092 17658951 14998606 9162740 15256516 15177127 16255080 17322881 17357073 10085125 17478679 11788823 18061058 15485476 17565224 1355351 6332166 17620530 15557412 11766883 17478681 17463248 11092828 17635891 10356983 10703799 15299019 16934002 15249516 17261661 17554300 17634449 17635890 1347801 17300749 9683310 16224054 16921375 17924335 12829554 16214597 14559957 15297675 12540690 3609719

In stage 1 of our genome-wide association (GWA) study for type 1 diabetes, one locus at 16p13 was detected (P = 1.03 x 10(-10)) and confirmed in two additional cohorts. Here we describe the results of testing, in these additional cohorts, 23 loci that were next in rank of statistical significance.	
18204098	Association of systemic lupus erythematosus with C8orf13-BLK and ITGAM-ITGAX.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous disease in which the risk of disease is influenced by complex genetic and environmental contributions. Alleles of HLA-DRB1, IRF5, and STAT4 are established susceptibility genes; there is strong evidence for the existence of additional risk loci.	
18252221	Three genome-wide association studies and a linkage analysis identify HERC2 as a human iris color gene.	Human iris color was one of the first traits for which Mendelian segregation was established. To date, the genetics of iris color is still not fully understood and is of interest, particularly in view of forensic applications. In three independent genome-wide association (GWA) studies of a total of 1406 persons and a genome-wide linkage study of 1292 relatives, all from the Netherlands, we found that the 15q13.1 region is the predominant region involved in human iris color. There were no other regions showing consistent genome-wide evidence for association and linkage to iris color. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HERC2 gene and, to a lesser extent, in the neighboring OCA2 gene were independently associated to iris color variation. OCA2 has been implicated in iris color previously. A replication study within two populations confirmed that the HERC2 gene is a new and significant determinant of human iris color variation, in addition to OCA2. Furthermore, HERC2 rs916977 showed a clinal allele distribution across 23 European populations, which was significantly correlated to iris color variation. We suggest that genetic variants regulating expression of the OCA2 gene exist in the HERC2 gene or, alternatively, within the 11.7 kb of sequence between OCA2 and HERC2, and that most iris color variation in Europeans is explained by those two genes. Testing markers in the HERC2-OCA2 region may be useful in forensic applications to predict eye color phenotypes of unknown persons of European genetic origin.	 17460697 17384015 17701901 17619204 17194218 10720573 11310796 11315092 11791212 11833005 12029063 12116252 12163334 12837695 14508708 14704187 14709592 15169604 15054401 15262401 7063747 3578281 3344216 2741944 1833235 1415228 8421497 8494033 7762554 8602783 9152135 9154287 9545414 9949213 15714523 15845033 15889046 16280011 16341609 16582909 17236130
18245381	Genome-wide association study shows BCL11A associated with persistent fetal hemoglobin and amelioration of the phenotype of beta-thalassemia.	beta-Thalassemia and sickle cell disease both display a great deal of phenotypic heterogeneity, despite being generally thought of as simple Mendelian diseases. The reasons for this are not well understood, although the level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is one well characterized ameliorating factor in both of these conditions. To better understand the genetic basis of this heterogeneity, we carried out genome-wide scans with 362,129 common SNPs on 4,305 Sardinians to look for genetic linkage and association with HbF levels, as well as other red blood cell-related traits. Among major variants affecting HbF levels, SNP rs11886868 in the BCL11A gene was strongly associated with this trait (P < 10(-35)). The C allele frequency was significantly higher in Sardinian individuals with elevated HbF levels, detected by screening for beta-thalassemia, and patients with attenuated forms of beta-thalassemia vs. those with thalassemia major. We also show that the same BCL11A variant is strongly associated with HbF levels in a large cohort of sickle cell patients. These results indicate that BCL11A variants, by modulating HbF levels, act as an important ameliorating factor of the beta-thalassemia phenotype, and it is likely they could help ameliorate other hemoglobin disorders. We expect our findings will help to characterize the molecular mechanisms of fetal globin regulation and could eventually contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.	 16861354 16710303 16685720 10607722 10842743 11315092 11719382 11731797 12111667 12717432 15205260 6198720 2412616 2461753 1710777 1379090 8116623 7993409 7517723 8528252 16921375 16934002 17129232 17436252 17503328 17592125 17767159 17924335 18376107 17658951 3828530 8651312 9859924 9915965 15639232 16252236 16255080 16704730
18264097	Multiple newly identified loci associated with prostate cancer susceptibility.	Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting males in developed countries. It shows consistent evidence of familial aggregation, but the causes of this aggregation are mostly unknown. To identify common alleles associated with prostate cancer risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using blood DNA samples from 1,854 individuals with clinically detected prostate cancer diagnosed at </=60 years or with a family history of disease, and 1,894 population-screened controls with a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration (<0.5 ng/ml). We analyzed these samples for 541,129 SNPs using the Illumina Infinium platform. Initial putative associations were confirmed using a further 3,268 cases and 3,366 controls. We identified seven loci associated with prostate cancer on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 19 and X (P = 2.7 x 10(-8) to P = 8.7 x 10(-29)). We confirmed previous reports of common loci associated with prostate cancer at 8q24 and 17q. Moreover, we found that three of the newly identified loci contain candidate susceptibility genes: MSMB, LMTK2 and KLK3.	
18264098	Common sequence variants on 2p15 and Xp11.22 confer susceptibility to prostate cancer.	We conducted a genome-wide SNP association study on prostate cancer on over 23,000 Icelanders, followed by a replication study including over 15,500 individuals from Europe and the United States. Two newly identified variants were shown to be associated with prostate cancer: rs5945572 on Xp11.22 and rs721048 on 2p15 (odds ratios (OR) = 1.23 and 1.15; P = 3.9 x 10(-13) and 7.7 x 10(-9), respectively). The 2p15 variant shows a significantly stronger association with more aggressive, rather than less aggressive, forms of the disease.	 10985348 11337497 11956213 12105228 12376548 14676205 7585019 7585188 16682969 17401363 17401364 17401366 17603485
18282107	Genome-wide association identifies a common variant in the reelin gene that increases the risk of schizophrenia only in women.	Sex differences in schizophrenia are well known, but their genetic basis has not been identified. We performed a genome-wide association scan for schizophrenia in an Ashkenazi Jewish population using DNA pooling. We found a female-specific association with rs7341475, a SNP in the fourth intron of the reelin (RELN) gene (p = 2.9 x 10(-5) in women), with a significant gene-sex effect (p = 1.8 x 10(-4)). We studied rs7341475 in four additional populations, totaling 2,274 cases and 4,401 controls. A significant effect was observed only in women, replicating the initial result (p = 2.1 x 10(-3) in women; p = 4.2 x 10(-3) for gene-sex interaction). Based on all populations the estimated relative risk of women carrying the common genotype is 1.58 (p = 8.8 x 10(-7); p = 1.6 x 10(-5) for gene-sex interaction). The female-specific association between RELN and schizophrenia is one of the few examples of a replicated sex-specific genetic association in any disease.	 17667963 12402217 16783572 12931209 17030554 17712072 12796219 10973257 12363388 15811185 12036111 12712319 16627870 11520926 12082559 15319578 10876649 15953657 17179997 10887978 12415316 17395743 16721403 10813800 7715726 17554300 11689558 15115547 15965968 17684500 17668382 17160900 4054595 16480507 16556465
18332876	A genome-wide association study in 574 schizophrenia trios using DNA pooling.	The cost of genome-wide association (GWA) studies can be prohibitively high when large samples are genotyped. We conducted a GWA study on schizophrenia (SZ) and to reduce the cost, we used DNA pooling. We used a parent-offspring trios design to avoid the potential problems of population stratification. We constructed pools from 605 unaffected controls, 574 SZ patients and a third pool from all the parents of the patients. We hybridized each pool eight times on Illumina HumanHap550 arrays. We estimated the allele frequencies of each pool from the averaged intensities of the arrays. The significance level of results in the trios sample was estimated on the basis of the allele frequencies in cases and non-transmitted pseudocontrols, taking into account the technical variability of the data. We selected the highest ranked SNPs for individual genotyping, after excluding poorly performing SNPs and those that showed a trend in the opposite direction in the control pool. We genotyped 63 SNPs in 574 trios and analysed the results with the transmission disequilibrium test. Forty of those were significant at P<0.05, with the best result at P=1.2 x 10(-6) for rs11064768. This SNP is within the gene CCDC60, a coiled-coil domain gene. The third best SNP (P=0.00016) is rs893703, within RBP1, a candidate gene for schizophrenia.	
18471798	Genome-wide association scan identifies a prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 variant involved in risk of knee osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent form of arthritis in the elderly, is characterized by the degradation of articular cartilage and has a strong genetic component. Our aim was to identify genetic variants involved in risk of knee OA in women. A pooled genome-wide association scan with the Illumina550 Duo array was performed in 255 controls and 387 cases. Twenty-eight variants with p < 1 x 10(-5) were estimated to have probabilities of being false positives <or=0.5 and were genotyped individually in the original samples and in replication cohorts from the UK and the U.S. (599 and 272 cases, 1530 and 258 controls, respectively). The top seven associations were subsequently tested in samples from the Netherlands (306 cases and 584 controls). rs4140564 on chromosome 1 mapping 5' to both the PTGS2 and PLA2G4A genes was associated with risk of knee OA in all the cohorts studied (overall odds ratio OR(mh) = 1.55 95% C.I. 1.30-1.85, p < 6.9 x 10(-7)). Differential allelic expression analysis of PTGS2 with mRNA extracted from the cartilage of joint-replacement surgery OA patients revealed a significant difference in allelic expression (p < 1.0 x 10(-6)). These results suggest the existence of cis-acting regulatory polymorphisms that are in, or near to, PTGS2 and in modest linkage disequilibrium with rs4140564. Our results and previous studies on the role of the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme encoded by PTGS2 underscore the importance of this signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of knee OA.	 12537873 12480916 15026468 15049520 15334460 15480072 3985566 3741515 1851225 8474072 9077531 10088775 10371510 14043587 15746150 15731292 16261124 16447229 16359877 16572458 17024313 16912703 16872525 16891653 17159887 17195216 17265476 17220169 17384641 17610740 17762607 17616513 17955331 17704066 18049793 18054255 18029383 11465712 11593451 11780939 12124863 14671726
18463975	A pilot genome-wide association study of early-onset breast cancer.	High-density oligonucleotide microarrays containing a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have enabled genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to become a reality. We used the early access Affymetrix Mendel Nsp 250K chips in a GWA case-control pilot study to identify genomic regions associated with breast cancer. We included 30 randomly sampled incident invasive breast cancer cases aged <45 years without deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, and 30 population controls individually matched on age, ethnicity and geographical area. The overall genotype call rate was 97.13+/-1.33% for controls and 97.48+/-1.42% for cases. Comparison was made between cases and controls for 203,477 genotyped SNPs using (a) unconditional logistic regression (ULR), (b) conditional logistic regression (CLR) models with adjustment for the matched pairs, (c) allelic tests for single marker tests and (d) haplotype trend regression (HTR). Genomic control and EIGENSTRAT methods were used for correction of population stratification in appropriate models. We demonstrate the similarity and dissimilarity of results from different statistical analyses. We found several possible significant regions harboring biologically meaningful known candidate genes, such as genes encoding fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and estrogen synthesis enzymes to be associated with early-onset breast cancer. In single marker analysis, none of the SNPs were statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. However, haplotype association tests, using 90730 tag-SNPs, suggested two regions in GLG1 and UGT1 genes retaining significance even after Bonferroni correction. Nevertheless, without systematic replication, findings from this pilot study, especially the associations of breast cancer in relation to specific SNPs, should be interpreted with great caution.	
18483556	A genome-wide association study identifies novel alleles associated with hair color and skin pigmentation.	We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study of natural hair color in more than 10,000 men and women of European ancestry from the United States and Australia. An initial analysis of 528,173 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped on 2,287 women identified IRF4 and SLC24A4 as loci highly associated with hair color, along with three other regions encompassing known pigmentation genes. We confirmed these associations in 7,028 individuals from three additional studies. Across these four studies, SLC24A4 rs12896399 and IRF4 rs12203592 showed strong associations with hair color, with p = 6.0x10(-62) and p = 7.46x10(-127), respectively. The IRF4 SNP was also associated with skin color (p = 6.2x10(-14)), eye color (p = 6.1x10(-13)), and skin tanning response to sunlight (p = 3.9x10(-89)). A multivariable analysis pooling data from the initial GWAS and an additional 1,440 individuals suggested that the association between rs12203592 and hair color was independent of rs1540771, a SNP between the IRF4 and EXOC2 genes previously found to be associated with hair color. After adjustment for rs12203592, the association between rs1540771 and hair color was not significant (p = 0.52). One variant in the MATP gene was associated with hair color. A variant in the HERC2 gene upstream of the OCA2 gene showed the strongest and independent association with hair color compared with other SNPs in this region, including three previously reported SNPs. The signals detected in a region around the MC1R gene were explained by MC1R red hair color alleles. Our results suggest that the IRF4 and SLC24A4 loci are associated with human hair color and skin pigmentation.	 17358008 11700328 17194218 17943122 17952075 18246066 10631149 12920225 14709592 15372380 7258341 7199888 7797077 7541907 8657101 8921401 14204850 15714523 16041375 16357253 16644865 16862161 16857289 16721784 17063143 17236130 16943234 17372279 10896812 11574907 17529973
18488028	Two newly identified genetic determinants of pigmentation in Europeans.	We present results from a genome-wide association study for variants associated with human pigmentation characteristics among 5,130 Icelanders, with follow-up analyses in 2,116 Icelanders and 1,214 Dutch individuals. Two coding variants in TPCN2 are associated with hair color, and a variant at the ASIP locus shows strong association with skin sensitivity to sun, freckling and red hair, phenotypic characteristics similar to those affected by well-known mutations in MC1R.	
18521091	Whole genome association study identifies polymorphisms associated with QT prolongation during iloperidone treatment of schizophrenia.	Administration of certain drugs (for example, antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antipsychotics) may occasionally affect myocardial repolarization and cause prolongation of the QT interval. We performed a whole genome association study of drug-induced QT prolongation after 14 days of treatment in a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a novel atypical antipsychotic, iloperidone, in patients with schizophrenia. We identified DNA polymorphisms associated with QT prolongation in six loci, including the CERKL and SLCO3A1 genes. Each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) defined two genotype groups associated with a low mean QT change (ranging from -0.69 to 5.67 ms depending on the SNP) or a higher mean QT prolongation (ranging from 14.16 to 17.81 ms). The CERKL protein is thought to be part of the ceramide pathway, which regulates currents conducted by various potassium channels, including the hERG channel. It is well established that inhibition of the hERG channel can prolong the QT interval. SLCO3A1 is thought to play a role in the translocation of prostaglandins, which have known cardioprotective properties, including the prevention of torsades de pointes. Our findings also point to genes involved in myocardial infarction (PALLD), cardiac structure and function (BRUNOL4) and cardiac development (NRG3). Results of this pharmacogenomic study provide new insight into the clinical response to iloperidone, developed with the goal of directing therapy to those patients with the optimal benefit/risk ratio.	
18535201	A genome-wide scan for common genetic variants with a large influence on warfarin maintenance dose.	Warfarin dosing is correlated with polymorphisms in vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) and the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) genes. Recently, the FDA revised warfarin labeling to raise physician awareness about these genetic effects. Randomized clinical trials are underway to test genetically based dosing algorithms. It is thus important to determine whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in other gene(s) have a large effect on warfarin dosing. A retrospective genome-wide association study was designed to identify polymorphisms that could explain a large fraction of the dose variance. White patients from an index warfarin population (n = 181) and 2 independent replication patient populations (n = 374) were studied. From the approximately 550 000 polymorphisms tested, the most significant independent effect was associated with VKORC1 polymorphisms (P = 6.2 x 10(-13)) in the index patients. CYP2C9 (rs1057910 CYP2C9*3) and rs4917639) was associated with dose at moderate significance levels (P approximately 10(-4)). Replication polymorphisms (355 SNPs) from the index study did not show any significant effects in the replication patient sets. We conclude that common SNPs with large effects on warfarin dose are unlikely to be discovered outside of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. Randomized clinical trials that account for these 2 genes should therefore produce results that are definitive and broadly applicable.	 10761997 17676998 12499305 14765194 14765195 17764537 15175798 17922574 17989110 17906972 18193044 18322281 18250228 18451855 18568023 15364900 8624064 10413320 15517978 15358623 15700229 15930419 16124863 16580898 16815313 16960144 17122850 17111199 17048007 17456829 17465713 11926893
18587394	Genome-wide association defines more than 30 distinct susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease.	Several risk factors for Crohn's disease have been identified in recent genome-wide association studies. To advance gene discovery further, we combined data from three studies on Crohn's disease (a total of 3,230 cases and 4,829 controls) and carried out replication in 3,664 independent cases with a mixture of population-based and family-based controls. The results strongly confirm 11 previously reported loci and provide genome-wide significant evidence for 21 additional loci, including the regions containing STAT3, JAK2, ICOSLG, CDKAL1 and ITLN1. The expanded molecular understanding of the basis of this disease offers promise for informed therapeutic development.	 15004560 17554261 15131796 3396969 10205198 15719322 15845037 16228001 16221758 16670770 16713979 16831596 16866365 16919486 17030948 17030949 17068223 17236132 17200410 17200669 17336692 17404271 17554300 15107849 17463249 17572673 17611496 17635957 17701901 17615381 17878369 17873877 17952073 17968351 18348202 18182054 18372903 19079170 11114383 11385576 11385577 11313366 11586304 12023369 17435756 17460697 17463246 17463248
18591461	Genomic association analysis suggests chromosome 12 locus influencing antihypertensive response to thiazide diuretic.	We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify novel genes influencing diastolic blood pressure (BP) response to hydrochlorothiazide, a commonly prescribed thiazide diuretic preferred for the treatment of high BP. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K Arrays were used to measure single nucleotide polymorphisms across the 22 autosomes in 194 non-Hispanic black subjects and 195 non-Hispanic white subjects with essential hypertension selected from opposite tertiles of the race- and sex-specific distributions of age-adjusted diastolic BP response to hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg daily, PO, for 4 weeks). The black sample consisted of 97 "good" responders (diastolic BP response [mean+/-SD]=-18.3+/-4.2 mm Hg; age=47.1+/-6.1 years; 51.5% women) and 97 "poor" responders (diastolic BP response=-0.18+/-4.3; age=47.4+/-6.5 years; 51.5% women). Haplotype trend regression identified a region of chromosome 12q15 in which haplotypes constructed from 3 successive single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs317689, rs315135, and rs7297610) in proximity to lysozyme (LYZ), YEATS domain containing 4 (YEATS4), and fibroblast growth receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) were significantly associated with diastolic BP response (nominal P=2.39 x 10(-7); Bonferroni corrected P=0.024; simulated experiment-wise P=0.040). Genotyping of 35 additional single nucleotide polymorphisms selected to "tag" linkage disequilibrium blocks in these genes provided corroboration that variation in LYZ and YEATS4 was associated with diastolic BP response in a statistically independent data set of 291 black subjects and in the sample of 294 white subjects. These results support the use of genome-wide association analyses to identify novel genes influencing antihypertensive drug responses.	 9777817 10489395 15562319 15718463 16172412 16086172 16199517 16255080 16862161 17470720 11204288 11600885 11691856 11791212 11849460 12037407 12461303 14553962 14656957 14681826 3049337 8446138 7476138 9149697
18594024	Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is associated with polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C8 in multiple myeloma: a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.	We have explored the potential role of genetics in the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients under bisphosphonate therapy. A genome-wide association study was performed using 500 568 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2 series of homogeneously treated MM patients, one with ONJ (22 MM cases) and another without ONJ (65 matched MM controls). Four SNPs (rs1934951, rs1934980, rs1341162, and rs17110453) mapped within the cytochrome P450-2C gene (CYP2C8) showed a different distribution between cases and controls with statistically significant differences (P = 1.07 x 10(-6), P = 4.231 x 10(-6), P = 6.22 x 10(-6), and P = 2.15 x 10(-6), respectively). SNP rs1934951 was significantly associated with a higher risk of ONJ development even after Bonferroni correction (P corrected value = .02). Genotyping results displayed an overrepresentation of the T allele in cases compared with controls (48% vs 12%). Thus, individuals homozygous for the T allele had an increased likelihood of developing ONJ (odds ratio 12.75, 95% confidence interval 3.7-43.5).	
18604267	Novel association of ABO histo-blood group antigen with soluble ICAM-1: results of a genome-wide association study of 6,578 women.	While circulating levels of soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (sICAM-1) have been associated with diverse conditions including myocardial infarction, stroke, malaria, and diabetes, comprehensive analysis of the common genetic determinants of sICAM-1 is not available. In a genome-wide association study conducted among 6,578 participants in the Women's Genome Health Study, we find that three SNPs at the ICAM1 (19p13.2) locus (rs1799969, rs5498 and rs281437) are non-redundantly associated with plasma sICAM-1 concentrations at a genome-wide significance level (P<5x10(-8)), thus extending prior results from linkage and candidate gene studies. We also find that a single SNP (rs507666, P = 5.1x10(-29)) at the ABO (9q34.2) locus is highly correlated with sICAM-1 concentrations. The novel association at the ABO locus provides evidence for a previously unknown regulatory role of histo-blood group antigens in inflammatory adhesion processes.	 10677532 15705809 11315092 11376339 11427453 11440495 11877368 12014997 12176954 12477764 12783117 12939654 14643123 15081401 15105499 15201278 15502096 5001056 984041 4074023 1968231 1675157 1346257 1520322 7687165 7822333 7642752 8834767 9111133 9439492 16978373 17002642 17118959 17357068 17389327 17701901 15789306 16087797 16625213 16862161 17502454 17903293 17943122 17112530 17973651 18196181 18070814 18208327 17640650 18045607 9833936 10933352

18650507	SLCO1B1 variants and statin-induced myopathy--a genomewide study.	Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statin therapy results in substantial reductions in cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in cholesterol may produce larger benefits. In rare cases, myopathy occurs in association with statin therapy, especially when the statins are administered at higher doses and with certain other medications.	
18677311	Identification of loci associated with schizophrenia by genome-wide association and follow-up.	We carried out a genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (479 cases, 2,937 controls) and tested loci with P < 10(-5) in up to 16,726 additional subjects. Of 12 loci followed up, 3 had strong independent support (P < 5 x 10(-4)), and the overall pattern of replication was unlikely to occur by chance (P = 9 x 10(-8)). Meta-analysis provided strongest evidence for association around ZNF804A (P = 1.61 x 10(-7)) and this strengthened when the affected phenotype included bipolar disorder (P = 9.96 x 10(-9)).

19165918	Genetic variants near TNFAIP3 on 6q23 are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We carried out a genome-wide association scan and replication study and found an association between SLE and a variant in TNFAIP3 (rs5029939, meta-analysis P = 2.89 x 10(-12), OR = 2.29). We also found evidence of two independent signals near TNFAIP3 associated with SLE, including one previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These results establish that variants near TNFAIP3 contribute to differential risk of SLE and RA.	 17982456 18163481 18204446 18204447 18204098 11007952 15258597 15334086 656162 9928991 17982455 17804842
18711365	Collaborative genome-wide association analysis supports a role for ANK3 and CACNA1C in bipolar disorder.	To identify susceptibility loci for bipolar disorder, we tested 1.8 million variants in 4,387 cases and 6,209 controls and identified a region of strong association (rs10994336, P = 9.1 x 10(-9)) in ANK3 (ankyrin G). We also found further support for the previously reported CACNA1C (alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel; combined P = 7.0 x 10(-8), rs1006737). Our results suggest that ion channelopathies may be involved in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder.	 18317468 17486107 17701901 17463246 17554300 17622937 17435756 17401366 17002500 16497276 16255080 15793588 7836469 14682359
18711366	SNPs in KCNQ1 are associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in East Asian and European populations.	We conducted a genome-wide association study using 207,097 SNP markers in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and unrelated controls, and identified KCNQ1 (potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1) to be a strong candidate for conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. We detected consistent association of a SNP in KCNQ1 (rs2283228) with the disease in several independent case-control studies (additive model P = 3.1 x 10(-12); OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.18-1.34). Several other SNPs in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block were strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (additive model: rs2237895, P = 7.3 x 10(-9); OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.20-1.45, rs2237897, P = 6.8 x 10(-13); OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.29-1.55). The association of these SNPs with type 2 diabetes was replicated in samples from Singaporean (additive model: rs2237895, P = 8.5 x 10(-3); OR = 1.14, rs2237897, P = 2.4 x 10(-4); OR = 1.22) and Danish populations (additive model: rs2237895, P = 3.7 x 10(-11); OR = 1.24, rs2237897, P = 1.2 x 10(-4); OR = 1.36).	
18758461	A genome-wide association study identifies six susceptibility loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of 299,983 tagging SNPs for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and performed validation in two additional series totaling 1,529 cases and 3,115 controls. We identified six previously unreported CLL risk loci at 2q13 (rs17483466; P = 2.36 x 10(-10)), 2q37.1 (rs13397985, SP140; P = 5.40 x 10(-10)), 6p25.3 (rs872071, IRF4; P = 1.91 x 10(-20)), 11q24.1 (rs735665; P = 3.78 x 10(-12)), 15q23 (rs7176508; P = 4.54 x 10(-12)) and 19q13.32 (rs11083846, PRKD2; P = 3.96 x 10(-9)). These data provide the first evidence for the existence of common, low-penetrance susceptibility to a hematological malignancy and new insights into disease causation in CLL.	
18759275	Association of a common nonsynonymous variant in GLUT9 with serum uric acid levels in old order amish.	Uric acid is the primary end product of purine metabolism. Increased serum uric acid levels have been associated with gouty arthritis as well as with a variety of cardiovascular-related phenotypes. This study was undertaken to investigate associations between uric acid levels and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).	 18163396 18179892 17997608 18440328 18244959 12426226 12707287 12826435 15025846 14739288 4166890 4843132 577077 3467311 1671712 7711025 10075613 15629458 15843466 16086449 16084170 16142856 16293642 16565251 16598194 16932373 17130256 17278930 17627523 17592072 17643880 17710649 17928824
18762592	Genomewide association analysis followed by a replication study implicates a novel candidate gene for neuroticism.	Neuroticism is a trait that reflects a tendency toward negative mood states. It has long been linked to internalizing psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression, and it accounts for much of the substantial comorbidity seen between these disorders.	
18776929	Identification of PLCL1 gene for hip bone size variation in females in a genome-wide association study.	Osteoporosis, the most prevalent metabolic bone disease among older people, increases risk for low trauma hip fractures (HF) that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hip bone size (BS) has been identified as one of the key measurable risk factors for HF. Although hip BS is highly genetically determined, genetic factors underlying the trait are still poorly defined. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hip BS interrogating approximately 380,000 SNPs on the Affymetrix platform in 1,000 homogeneous unrelated Caucasian subjects, including 501 females and 499 males. We identified a gene, PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1), that had four SNPs associated with hip BS at, or approaching, a genome-wide significance level in our female subjects; the most significant SNP, rs7595412, achieved a p value of 3.72x10(-7). The gene's importance to hip BS was replicated using the Illumina genotyping platform in an independent UK cohort containing 1,216 Caucasian females. Two SNPs of the PLCL1 gene, rs892515 and rs9789480, surrounded by the four SNPs identified in our GWAS, achieved p values of 8.62x10(-3) and 2.44x10(-3), respectively, for association with hip BS. Imputation analyses on our GWAS and the UK samples further confirmed the replication signals; eight SNPs of the gene achieved combined imputed p values<10(-5) in the two samples. The PLCL1 gene's relevance to HF was also observed in a Chinese sample containing 403 females, including 266 with HF and 177 control subjects. A SNP of the PLCL1 gene, rs3771362 that is only approximately 0.6 kb apart from the most significant SNP detected in our GWAS (rs7595412), achieved a p value of 7.66x10(-3) (odds ratio = 0.26) for association with HF. Additional biological support for the role of PLCL1 in BS comes from previous demonstrations that the PLCL1 protein inhibits IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-mediated calcium signaling, an important pathway regulating mechanical sensing of bone cells. Our findings suggest that PLCL1 is a novel gene associated with variation in hip BS, and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HF.	 17444815 17213281 17434869 17522711 17529973 17572673 17529967 17701901 18455228 18633665 17435756 10835412 11149475 11315092 11341336 11780939 12434164 12454799 15454942 1887871 1536984 8030442 8725168 9541527 9632852 15644334 15777651 15657097 16267090 16267109 16491291 16845089 16995807 16825438 17068223 17228994
18794855	Sequence variant on 8q24 confers susceptibility to urinary bladder cancer.	We conducted a genome-wide SNP association study on 1,803 urinary bladder cancer (UBC) cases and 34,336 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands and follow up studies in seven additional case-control groups (2,165 cases and 3,800 controls). The strongest association was observed with allele T of rs9642880 on chromosome 8q24, 30 kb upstream of MYC (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.22; P = 9.34 x 10(-12)). Approximately 20% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous for rs9642880[T], and their estimated risk of developing UBC is 1.49 times that of noncarriers. No association was observed between UBC and the four 8q24 variants previously associated with prostate, colorectal and breast cancers, nor did rs9642880 associate with any of these three cancers. A weaker signal, but nonetheless of genome-wide significance, was captured by rs710521[A] located near TP63 on chromosome 3q28 (allele-specific OR = 1.19; P = 1. 15 x 10(-7)).	 11315092 17684133 17401366 1950701 9850170 17529967 16470587 16682969 16413481 18385676 12646919 18344981 11857419 16737809 12368193 17529974 18385738 15630470 14517540 17401363 17603485 3500674 15654335 18385739 14645543 13655060 17135278 17618284 14654529
18823527	A genome-wide association study for late-onset Alzheimer's disease using DNA pooling.	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is an age related neurodegenerative disease with a high prevalence that places major demands on healthcare resources in societies with increasingly aged populations. The only extensively replicable genetic risk factor for LOAD is the apolipoprotein E gene. In order to identify additional genetic risk loci we have conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study in a large LOAD case - control sample, reducing costs through the use of DNA pooling.	 8670538 5662937 17610740 12073018 3790869 9153155 16360788 12642066 10866211 18276640 17922574 17530621 17474819 11140947 17373700 16461860 4065839 12604774 15305858 15716907 7486872 3249768 1202204 15297300 12415316 3337862 8103823 10211150 5655944 18332876 17554300 11253062 17701901 10631151 17998437 17001693 17264871 6610841 17160900 16480507
20031538	Genome-wide association analysis of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the population-based KORA study sheds new light on intergenic regions.	High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis and is assumed to be under considerable genetic control.

18846501	Does parental expressed emotion moderate genetic effects in ADHD? An exploration using a genome wide association scan.	Studies of gene x environment (G x E) interaction in ADHD have previously focused on known risk genes for ADHD and environmentally mediated biological risk. Here we use G x E analysis in the context of a genome-wide association scan to identify novel genes whose effects on ADHD symptoms and comorbid conduct disorder are moderated by high maternal expressed emotion (EE). SNPs (600,000) were genotyped in 958 ADHD proband-parent trios. After applying data cleaning procedures we examined 429,981 autosomal SNPs in 909 family trios. ADHD symptom severity and comorbid conduct disorder was measured using the Parental Account of Childhood Symptoms interview. Maternal criticism and warmth (i.e., EE) were coded by independent observers on comments made during the interview. No G x E interactions reached genome-wide significance. Nominal effects were found both with and without genetic main effects. For those with genetic main effects 36 uncorrected interaction P-values were <10(-5) implicating both novel genes as well as some previously supported candidates. These were found equally often for all of the interactions being investigated. The observed interactions in SLC1A1 and NRG3 SNPs represent reasonable candidate genes for further investigation given their previous association with several psychiatric illnesses. We find evidence for the role of EE in moderating the effects of genes on ADHD severity and comorbid conduct disorder, implicating both novel and established candidates. These findings need replicating in larger independent samples.	
18839057	Molecular genetics of adult ADHD: converging evidence from genome-wide association and extended pedigree linkage studies.	A genome-wide association (GWA) study with pooled DNA in adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) employing approximately 500K SNP markers identifies novel risk genes and reveals remarkable overlap with findings from recent GWA scans in substance use disorders. Comparison with results from our previously reported high-resolution linkage scan in extended pedigrees confirms several chromosomal loci, including 16q23.1-24.3 which also reached genome-wide significance in a recent meta-analysis of seven linkage studies (Zhou et al. in Am J Med Genet Part B, 2008). The findings provide additional support for a common effect of genes coding for cell adhesion molecules (e.g., CDH13, ASTN2) and regulators of synaptic plasticity (e.g., CTNNA2, KALRN) despite the complex multifactorial etiologies of adult ADHD and addiction vulnerability.	 15703273 18316681 17376403 17667963 17463246 15497111 18067574 16547280 11861479 17764662 18031682 17529967 11923911 17401730 18276640 18301393 17610740 18411300 14615605 14643117 17671248 15950004 12089526 12783867 16480507 11223174 17099884 8602532 17053149 17299456 10202547 16894614 17485554 18988193 11606631 17846126 16585449 17407593 18553066 18519826 14668223 18332876 14766376 12906867 12679898 17062589 18442417 18188442 18599010 18194558 18597863 17486107 10777487 17160900 17553421 17158188
18940312	Population-based genome-wide association studies reveal six loci influencing plasma levels of liver enzymes.	Plasma liver-enzyme tests are widely used in the clinic for the diagnosis of liver diseases and for monitoring the response to drug treatment. There is considerable evidence that human genetic variation influences plasma levels of liver enzymes. However, such genetic variation has not been systematically assessed. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide association study of plasma liver-enzyme levels in three populations (total n = 7715) with replication in three additional cohorts (total n = 4704). We identified two loci influencing plasma levels of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) (CPN1-ERLIN1-CHUK on chromosome 10 and PNPLA3-SAMM50 on chromosome 22), one locus influencing gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (HNF1A on chromosome 12), and three loci for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (ALPL on chromosome 1, GPLD1 on chromosome 6, and JMJD1C-REEP3 on chromosome 10). In addition, we confirmed the associations between the GGT1 locus and GGT levels and between the ABO locus and ALP levels. None of the ALP-associated SNPs were associated with other liver tests, suggesting intestine and/or bone specificity. The mechanisms underlying the associations may involve cis- or trans-transcriptional effects (some of the identified variants were associated with mRNA transcription in human liver or lymphoblastoid cells), dysfunction of the encoded proteins (caused by missense variations at the functional domains), or other unknown pathways. These findings may help in the interpretation of liver-enzyme tests and provide candidate genes for liver diseases of viral, metabolic, autoimmune, or toxic origin. The specific associations with ALP levels may point to genes for bone or intestinal diseases.	 11148181 18317757 12355088 14570913 14687935 5125329 6684395 3408501 2571419 2357969 7776974 9455610 16159911 16505250 16362079 16595594 16845089 16835267 16862161 16914601 16799181 16772340 17384006 17572673 17701901 17719863 17873877 17971785 18061062 18003757 18193046 18249212 18262040 18316753 18358813 18362506 18256235 18366642 18439552 18464913 18454146 18454148 18462017 12194918
18849994	Susceptibility variants for male-pattern baldness on chromosome 20p11.	We carried out a genome-wide association study in 296 individuals with male-pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) and 347 controls. We then investigated the 30 best SNPs in an independent replication sample and found highly significant association for five SNPs on chromosome 20p11 (rs2180439 combined P = 2.7 x 10(-15)). No interaction was detected with the X-chromosomal androgen receptor locus, suggesting that the 20p11 locus has a role in a yet-to-be-identified androgen-independent pathway.	
18849993	Common variants on 1p36 and 1q42 are associated with cutaneous basal cell carcinoma but not with melanoma or pigmentation traits.	To search for new sequence variants that confer risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC), we conducted a genome-wide SNP association study of 930 Icelanders with BCC and 33,117 controls. After analyzing 304,083 SNPs, we observed signals from loci at 1p36 and 1q42, and replicated these associations in additional sample sets from Iceland and Eastern Europe. Overall, the most significant signals were from rs7538876 on 1p36 (OR = 1.28, P = 4.4 x 10(-12)) and rs801114 on 1q42 (OR = 1.28, P = 5.9 x 10(-12)). The 1p36 locus contains the candidate genes PADI4, PADI6, RCC2 and ARHGEF10L, and the gene nearest to the 1q42 locus is the ras-homolog RHOU. Neither locus was associated with fair pigmentation traits that are known risk factors for BCC, and no risk was observed for melanoma. Approximately 1.6% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous for both variants, and their estimated risk of BCC is 2.68 times that of noncarriers.	
18941528	Identification of a novel risk locus for multiple sclerosis at 13q31.3 by a pooled genome-wide scan of 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms.	Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with an important genetic component and strongest association driven by the HLA genes. We performed a pooling-based genome-wide association study of 500,000 SNPs in order to find new loci associated with the disease. After applying several criteria, 320 SNPs were selected from the microarrays and individually genotyped in a first and independent Spanish Caucasian replication cohort. The 8 most significant SNPs validated in this cohort were also genotyped in a second US Caucasian replication cohort for confirmation. The most significant association was obtained for SNP rs3129934, which neighbors the HLA-DRB/DQA loci and validates our pooling-based strategy. The second strongest association signal was found for SNP rs1327328, which resides in an unannotated region of chromosome 13 but is in linkage disequilibrium with nearby functional elements that may play important roles in disease susceptibility. This region of chromosome 13 has not been previously identified in MS linkage genome screens and represents a novel risk locus for the disease.	 15868469 15771584 15973459 16998491 17041890 17160900 17467975 17660716 17660816 17660817 17660530 18515823 11719808 11754817 11834600 12225902 14571262 15081262 6847134 1926129 9668163 15944709
18952825	Common variants in the JAZF1 gene associated with height identified by linkage and genome-wide association analysis.	Genes for height have gained interest for decades, but only recently have candidate genes started to be identified. We have performed linkage analysis and genome-wide association for height in approximately 4000 individuals from five European populations. A total of five chromosomal regions showed suggestive linkage and in one of these regions, two SNPs (rs849140 and rs1635852) were associated with height (nominal P = 7.0 x 10(-8) and P = 9.6 x 10(-7), respectively). In total, five SNPs across the genome showed an association with height that reached the threshold of genome-wide significance (nominal P < 1.6 x 10(-7)). The association with height was replicated for two SNPs (rs1635852 and rs849140) using three independent studies (n = 31 077, n=1268 and n = 5746) with overall meta P-values of 9.4 x 10(-10) and 5.3 x 10(-8). These SNPs are located in the JAZF1 gene, which has recently been associated with type II diabetes, prostate and endometrial cancer. JAZF1 is a transcriptional repressor of NR2C2, which results in low IGF1 serum concentrations, perinatal and early postnatal hypoglycemia and growth retardation when knocked out in mice. Both the linkage and association analyses independently identified the JAZF1 region affecting human height. We have demonstrated, through replication in additional independent populations, the consistency of the effect of the JAZF1 SNPs on height. Since this gene also has a key function in the metabolism of growth, JAZF1 represents one of the strongest candidates influencing human height identified so far.	 10801388 17767157 1833235 15477591 15302918 15054401 11731797 9326339 9545414 9837839 15549393 17924335 17955331 17934319 18060068 18193045 18264096 18372901 18372903 18391950 18391951 18391952 11371647 17660554 17618283 17550581 17564960 17384015
18951430	Conduct disorder and ADHD: evaluation of conduct problems as a categorical and quantitative trait in the international multicentre ADHD genetics study.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically characterized by inattention, excessive motor activity, impulsivity, and distractibility. Individuals with ADHD have significant impairment in family and peer relations, academic functioning, and show high co-morbidity with a wide range of psychiatric disorders including oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), anxiety disorder, depression, substance abuse, and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Family studies suggest that ADHD + CD represents a specific subtype of the ADHD disorder with familial risk factors only partly overlapping with those of ADHD alone. We performed a hypothesis-free analysis of the GAIN-ADHD sample to identify markers and genes important in the development of conduct problems in a European cohort of individuals with ADHD. Using the Family-Based Association Test (FBAT) package we examined three measures of conduct problems in 1,043,963 autosomal markers. This study is part of a series of exploratory analyses to identify candidate genes that may be important in ADHD and ADHD-related traits, such as conduct problems. We did not find genome-wide statistical significance (P < 5 x 10(-7)) for any of the tested markers and the three conduct problem traits. Fifty-four markers reached strong GWA signals (P < 10(-5)). We discuss these findings in the context of putative candidate genes and the implications of these findings in the understanding of the etiology of ADHD + CD. We aimed to achieve insight into the genetic etiology of a trait using a hypothesis-free study design and were able to identify a number of biologically interesting markers and genes for follow-up studies.	
18978787	Common 5p15.33 and 6p21.33 variants influence lung cancer risk.	We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study of lung cancer comparing 511,919 SNP genotypes in 1,952 cases and 1,438 controls. The most significant association was attained at 15q25.1 (rs8042374; P = 7.75 x 10(-12)), confirming recent observations. Pooling data with two other GWA studies (5,095 cases, 5,200 controls) and with replication in an additional 2,484 cases and 3,036 controls, we identified two newly associated risk loci mapping to 6p21.33 (rs3117582, BAT3-MSH5; P(combined) = 4.97 x 10(-10)) and 5p15.33 (rs401681, CLPTM1L; P(combined) = 7.90 x 10(-9)).	 11146445 11162647 11870883 15382071 16155052 18385676 17403783 18328944 18385738 18385739 17108209
18978790	Lung cancer susceptibility locus at 5p15.33.	We carried out a genome-wide association study of lung cancer (3,259 cases and 4,159 controls), followed by replication in 2,899 cases and 5,573 controls. Two uncorrelated disease markers at 5p15.33, rs402710 and rs2736100 were detected by the genome-wide data (P = 2 x 10(-7) and P = 4 x 10(-6)) and replicated by the independent study series (P = 7 x 10(-5) and P = 0.016). The susceptibility region contains two genes, TERT and CLPTM1L, suggesting that one or both may have a role in lung cancer etiology.	 10647931 18385676 12871779 15094035 3907856 2463488 9398860 16110488 16247010 17130181 17311257 17913752 18385738 18385739 11162647
18985386	Genomewide association study for susceptibility genes contributing to familial Parkinson disease.	Five genes have been identified that contribute to Mendelian forms of Parkinson disease (PD); however, mutations have been found in fewer than 5% of patients, suggesting that additional genes contribute to disease risk. Unlike previous studies that focused primarily on sporadic PD, we have performed the first genomewide association study (GWAS) in familial PD. Genotyping was performed with the Illumina HumanCNV370Duo array in 857 familial PD cases and 867 controls. A logistic model was employed to test for association under additive and recessive modes of inheritance after adjusting for gender and age. No result met genomewide significance based on a conservative Bonferroni correction. The strongest association result was with SNPs in the GAK/DGKQ region on chromosome 4 (additive model: p = 3.4 x 10(-6); OR = 1.69). Consistent evidence of association was also observed to the chromosomal regions containing SNCA (additive model: p = 5.5 x 10(-5); OR = 1.35) and MAPT (recessive model: p = 2.0 x 10(-5); OR = 0.56). Both of these genes have been implicated previously in PD susceptibility; however, neither was identified in previous GWAS studies of PD. Meta-analysis was performed using data from a previous case-control GWAS, and yielded improved p values for several regions, including GAK/DGKQ (additive model: p = 2.5 x 10(-7)) and the MAPT region (recessive model: p = 9.8 x 10(-6); additive model: p = 4.8 x 10(-5)). These data suggest the identification of new susceptibility alleles for PD in the GAK/DGKQ region, and also provide further support for the role of SNCA and MAPT in PD susceptibility.	 16685659 16769863 16896109 16938560 16797215 17052657 17078970 17078063 17352422 15201350 15451224 15451225 2841426 9197268 9462735 10319883 15455214 15297300 15654335 15786467 15627775 15966003 16252231 17701901 17514749 17804834 17872362 18091429 18162487 18509094 11710888 11781409 12058349 12629236 14593171 14755719 15197702
18997786	Susceptibility loci for intracranial aneurysm in European and Japanese populations.	Stroke is the world's third leading cause of death. One cause of stroke, intracranial aneurysm, affects approximately 2% of the population and accounts for 500,000 hemorrhagic strokes annually in mid-life (median age 50), most often resulting in death or severe neurological impairment. The pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm is unknown, and because catastrophic hemorrhage is commonly the first sign of disease, early identification is essential. We carried out a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Finnish, Dutch and Japanese cohorts including over 2,100 intracranial aneurysm cases and 8,000 controls. Genome-wide genotyping of the European cohorts and replication studies in the Japanese cohort identified common SNPs on chromosomes 2q, 8q and 9p that show significant association with intracranial aneurysm with odds ratios 1.24-1.36. The loci on 2q and 8q are new, whereas the 9p locus was previously found to be associated with arterial diseases, including intracranial aneurysm. Associated SNPs on 8q likely act via SOX17, which is required for formation and maintenance of endothelial cells, suggesting a role in development and repair of the vasculature; CDKN2A at 9p may have a similar role. These findings have implications for the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy of intracranial aneurysm.	 11062304 18443294 7666217 9020076 10477517 15540160 16228001 16497978 16895970 17002866 16957735 17322881 17440112 17463246 17463248 17463249 17554300 17478679 17478681 17610846 17603472 17655922 17943122 18176561 18252225 18309175 18372903 18391953 18323491 15052270
18997785	Genetic variation in the KIF1B locus influences susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.	The few loci associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) are all related to immune function. We report a GWA study identifying a new locus replicated in 2,679 cases and 3,125 controls. An rs10492972[C] variant located in the KIF1B gene was associated with MS with an odds ratio of 1.35 (P = 2.5 x 10(-10)). KIF1B is a neuronally expressed gene plausibly implicated in the irreversible axonal loss characterizing MS in the long term.	
19010793	Genome-wide association analysis of susceptibility and clinical phenotype in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic disorder of the central nervous system and common cause of neurological disability in young adults, is characterized by moderate but complex risk heritability. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study performed in a 1000 prospective case series of well-characterized individuals with MS and group-matched controls using the Sentrix HumanHap550 BeadChip platform from Illumina. After stringent quality control data filtering, we compared allele frequencies for 551 642 SNPs in 978 cases and 883 controls and assessed genotypic influences on susceptibility, age of onset, disease severity, as well as brain lesion load and normalized brain volume from magnetic resonance imaging exams. A multi-analytical strategy identified 242 susceptibility SNPs exceeding established thresholds of significance, including 65 within the MHC locus in chromosome 6p21.3. Independent replication confirms a role for GPC5, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in disease risk. Gene ontology-based analysis shows a functional dichotomy between genes involved in the susceptibility pathway and those affecting the clinical phenotype.	 11351200 12930761 17660816 16547280 18721276 11920158 18650830 9972873 10331690 11456302 15824338 15615769 15573124 17447842 18401352 9560156 18195134 14669136 15795250 11955556 17107664 18354419 14732476 16077740 11834600 16415888 16407548 16283615 18082433 11169984 17971048 18505598 14737177 12825072 16421571 17005408 17261686 18087043 17015227 10805331 17252545 16734611 16905117 16998491 17977705 10196086 11682119 6685237 1926129 12122039 17660817 16417999 16311013 12127652 12482100 14997420 17660530 18282107 15589308 13263457 17952073 15950723 11855950 17696989 11678987
19011631	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies four new susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer.	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple loci at which common variants modestly influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). To enhance power to identify additional loci with similar effect sizes, we conducted a meta-analysis of two GWA studies, comprising 13,315 individuals genotyped for 38,710 common tagging SNPs. We undertook replication testing in up to eight independent case-control series comprising 27,418 subjects. We identified four previously unreported CRC risk loci at 14q22.2 (rs4444235, BMP4; P = 8.1 x 10(-10)), 16q22.1 (rs9929218, CDH1; P = 1.2 x 10(-8)), 19q13.1 (rs10411210, RHPN2; P = 4.6 x 10(-9)) and 20p12.3 (rs961253; P = 2.0 x 10(-10)). These findings underscore the value of large sample series for discovery and follow-up of genetic variants contributing to the etiology of CRC.	 16042571 16415888 16155052 16362079 17014726 16715134 17178865 17200375 17289997 17293864 17401363 12019147 17618283 17618284 17895893 17934461 18084292 18372901 18372905 18577746 18715499 18758461 10706097 10891514 11171827 11381269 11536076 3992076 15378062 14557987 12221077 12111919 10206617 10072428 9823339 2301364 8944229 9491320 9537325 17618282 11562785 11693338
19030899	Genome-wide association scan for stature in Chinese: evidence for ethnic specific loci.	In Caucasian, several studies have identified some common variants associated with human stature variation. However, no such study was performed in Chinese, which is the largest population in the world and evidently differs from Caucasian in genetic background. To identify common or ethnic specific genes for stature in Chinese, an initial GWAS and follow-up replication study were performed. Our initial GWAS study found that a group of 13 contiguous SNPs, which span a region of approximately 150 kb containing two neighboring genes, zinc finger protein (ZNP) 510 and ZNP782, achieved strong signals for association with stature, with P values ranging from 9.71 x 10(-5) to 3.11 x 10(-6). After false discovery rate correction for multiple testing, 9 of the 13 SNPs remain significant (FDR q=0.036-0.046). The follow-up replication study in an independent 2,953 unrelated southern Chinese confirmed the association of rs10816533 with stature (P=0.029). All the 13 SNPs were in consistently strong linkage disequilibrium (D'>0.99) and formed a single perfect haplotype block. The minor allele frequencies for the 13 contiguous SNPs have evidently ethnic difference, which range from 0.21 to 0.33 in Chinese but have as low as approximately 0.017 reported in dbSNP database in Caucasian. The present results suggest that the genomic region containing the ZNP510 and ZNP782 genes is an ethnic specific locus associated with stature variation in Chinese.	 10731467 11315092 12914574 16862161 12400063 18391951 14991526 10835412 18193045 16446976 2239101 15469424 18391950 17572673 14574571 11410839 12119602 12883005 11410840 10615131 9773847 15297300 17767157 9182765 18396995 11753821 7614237 14566097 16117875 16675888 18391952 16845089 12491092 15470266 16849413 12673281
18957941	Genome-wide association scan for five major dimensions of personality.	Personality traits are summarized by five broad dimensions with pervasive influences on major life outcomes, strong links to psychiatric disorders and clear heritable components. To identify genetic variants associated with each of the five dimensions of personality we performed a genome-wide association (GWA) scan of 3972 individuals from a genetically isolated population within Sardinia, Italy. On the basis of the analyses of 362 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms we found several strong signals within or near genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders. They include the association of neuroticism with SNAP25 (rs362584, P=5 x 10(-5)), extraversion with BDNF and two cadherin genes (CDH13 and CDH23; Ps<5 x 10(-5)), openness with CNTNAP2 (rs10251794, P=3 x 10(-5)), agreeableness with CLOCK (rs6832769, P=9 x 10(-6)) and conscientiousness with DYRK1A (rs2835731, P=3 x 10(-5)). Effect sizes were small (less than 1% of variance), and most failed to replicate in the follow-up independent samples (N up to 3903), though the association between agreeableness and CLOCK was supported in two of three replication samples (overall P=2 x 10(-5)). We infer that a large number of loci may influence personality traits and disorders, requiring larger sample sizes for the GWA approach to confidently identify associated genetic variants.	 10631157 15789306 12660803 17667963 17221848 11315092 10198158 11555628 12102386 16862161 12612864 12585813 9160755 17658951 18193045 18174335 18193043 17516548 18179893 17068223 17427203 16415884 15947021 15939839 12123610 17502808 9553006 17909133 18347602 11711867 10718200 17646849 18391950 18596250 16972192 17434869 16648327 16582909 16646633 16801949 15555928 17324033 18405382 17116390 17145134 9501762 16415888 11699599 12407180 9654759 11519935 15108187 17015813 17135279 15578592 3820076 8215811 17767157 18245381 16861305 7381680 10737605 8279933 19002272 16461986 16934002 16784347 16248708 17554300 17634449 11884350 8332215 18179894 18317468 14582141 12456358 17924335 15740445 10082017 18179895 16088329 16542183 9915965 15351774 17997608 15389754
19043545	Genetics meets metabolomics: a genome-wide association study of metabolite profiles in human serum.	The rapidly evolving field of metabolomics aims at a comprehensive measurement of ideally all endogenous metabolites in a cell or body fluid. It thereby provides a functional readout of the physiological state of the human body. Genetic variants that associate with changes in the homeostasis of key lipids, carbohydrates, or amino acids are not only expected to display much larger effect sizes due to their direct involvement in metabolite conversion modification, but should also provide access to the biochemical context of such variations, in particular when enzyme coding genes are concerned. To test this hypothesis, we conducted what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GWA study with metabolomics based on the quantitative measurement of 363 metabolites in serum of 284 male participants of the KORA study. We found associations of frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with considerable differences in the metabolic homeostasis of the human body, explaining up to 12% of the observed variance. Using ratios of certain metabolite concentrations as a proxy for enzymatic activity, up to 28% of the variance can be explained (p-values 10(-16) to 10(-21)). We identified four genetic variants in genes coding for enzymes (FADS1, LIPC, SCAD, MCAD) where the corresponding metabolic phenotype (metabotype) clearly matches the biochemical pathways in which these enzymes are active. Our results suggest that common genetic polymorphisms induce major differentiations in the metabolic make-up of the human population. This may lead to a novel approach to personalized health care based on a combination of genotyping and metabolic characterization. These genetically determined metabotypes may subscribe the risk for a certain medical phenotype, the response to a given drug treatment, or the reaction to a nutritional intervention or environmental challenge.	 18791962 18372322 20031538 11860207 12120097 15229644 9060471 15832312 16032514 16052242 16381885 16553314 16670158 16902246 17003564 16893529 17202168 17298438 17435758 17554300 17554260 17584797 17637780 17634449 17984066 18179892 18193043 18193044 18230739 18327256 18320251 18398418 18372903 18842110
19060907	Variants in MTNR1B influence fasting glucose levels.	To identify previously unknown genetic loci associated with fasting glucose concentrations, we examined the leading association signals in ten genome-wide association scans involving a total of 36,610 individuals of European descent. Variants in the gene encoding melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) were consistently associated with fasting glucose across all ten studies. The strongest signal was observed at rs10830963, where each G allele (frequency 0.30 in HapMap CEU) was associated with an increase of 0.07 (95% CI = 0.06-0.08) mmol/l in fasting glucose levels (P = 3.2 x 10(-50)) and reduced beta-cell function as measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-B, P = 1.1 x 10(-15)). The same allele was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio = 1.09 (1.05-1.12), per G allele P = 3.3 x 10(-7)) in a meta-analysis of 13 case-control studies totaling 18,236 cases and 64,453 controls. Our analyses also confirm previous associations of fasting glucose with variants at the G6PC2 (rs560887, P = 1.1 x 10(-57)) and GCK (rs4607517, P = 1.0 x 10(-25)) loci.	 10543671 18678614 3899825 7568007 8770017 10364681 15845877 16255080 16567531 17186458 17293876 17439551 17460697 17463246 17463248 17463249 17473220 17873874 17873877 17955331 17982457 17977958 18194202 18372903 18451265 18462017 18521185 18597214 18363673 11904358

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition with environmental and genetic etiologies. Up to this point, research has identified genetic associations with candidate genes from known biological pathways. In order to identify novel ADHD susceptibility genes, 600,000 SNPs were genotyped in 958 ADHD proband-parent trios. After applying data cleaning procedures we examined 429,981 autosomal SNPs in 909 family trios. We generated six quantitative phenotypes from 18 ADHD symptoms to be used in genome-wide association analyses. With the PBAT screening algorithm, we identified 2 SNPs, rs6565113 and rs552655 that met the criteria for significance within a specified phenotype. These SNPs are located in intronic regions of genes CDH13 and GFOD1, respectively. CDH13 has been implicated previously in substance use disorders. We also evaluated the association of SNPs from a list of 37 ADHD candidate genes that was specified a priori. These findings, along with association P-values with a magnitude less than 10(-5), are discussed in this manuscript. Seventeen of these candidate genes had association P-values lower then 0.01: SLC6A1, SLC9A9, HES1, ADRB2, HTR1E, DDC, ADRA1A, DBH, DRD2, BDNF, TPH2, HTR2A, SLC6A2, PER1, CHRNA4, SNAP25, and COMT. Among the candidate genes, SLC9A9 had the strongest overall associations with 58 association test P-values lower than 0.01 and multiple association P-values at a magnitude of 10(-5) in this gene. In sum, these findings identify novel genetic associations at viable ADHD candidate genes and provide confirmatory evidence for associations at previous candidate genes. Replication of these results is necessary in order to confirm the proposed genetic variants for ADHD.	
19060906	Common variants at 30 loci contribute to polygenic dyslipidemia.	Blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To dissect the polygenic basis of these traits, we conducted genome-wide association screens in 19,840 individuals and replication in up to 20,623 individuals. We identified 30 distinct loci associated with lipoprotein concentrations (each with P < 5 x 10(-8)), including 11 loci that reached genome-wide significance for the first time. The 11 newly defined loci include common variants associated with LDL cholesterol near ABCG8, MAFB, HNF1A and TIMD4; with HDL cholesterol near ANGPTL4, FADS1-FADS2-FADS3, HNF4A, LCAT, PLTP and TTC39B; and with triglycerides near AMAC1L2, FADS1-FADS2-FADS3 and PLTP. The proportion of individuals exceeding clinical cut points for high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides varied according to an allelic dosage score (P < 10(-15) for each trend). These results suggest that the cumulative effect of multiple common variants contributes to polygenic dyslipidemia.	 1347801 17632509 17903299 17960135 18179892 18193043 18193044 18262040 11099417 11158324 11279518 11368702 18354102 18348202 18451988 18462017 17952847 17372189 17569884 10634821 10750603 12401877 12730697 14988562 14703505 15135046 15292318 5327099 474565 6859102 3990714 2052566 1430212 8429286 8941656 10079112 10517866 13751193 15358785 15385538 15654334 15677715 15728204 16465619 16554528 16670158 17357073 17322881 17463246 17463248

19079261	Six new loci associated with body mass index highlight a neuronal influence on body weight regulation.	Common variants at only two loci, FTO and MC4R, have been reproducibly associated with body mass index (BMI) in humans. To identify additional loci, we conducted meta-analysis of 15 genome-wide association studies for BMI (n > 32,000) and followed up top signals in 14 additional cohorts (n > 59,000). We strongly confirm FTO and MC4R and identify six additional loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)): TMEM18, KCTD15, GNPDA2, SH2B1, MTCH2 and NEGR1 (where a 45-kb deletion polymorphism is a candidate causal variant). Several of the likely causal genes are highly expressed or known to act in the central nervous system (CNS), emphasizing, as in rare monogenic forms of obesity, the role of the CNS in predisposition to obesity.	 15274050 8557845 9019399 9519560 9916804 10330412 15899861 15946856 16099088 16395124 16614226 16741264 16936201 17237739 17235396 17327436 17434869 17496892 17554300 17572673 17634449 17565041 17873877 17924335 17986696 17982457 17991826 18154499 18160634 18193043 18256137 17658951 18372903 18391950 18391952 18325910 18346983 18454148 18454146 18614015 18604207 18535543 18776908 19079260 11285241 11731797 12355400 12824367 15024690
19074352	A null mutation in human APOC3 confers a favorable plasma lipid profile and apparent cardioprotection.	Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) inhibits triglyceride hydrolysis and has been implicated in coronary artery disease. Through a genome-wide association study, we have found that about 5% of the Lancaster Amish are heterozygous carriers of a null mutation (R19X) in the gene encoding apoC-III (APOC3) and, as a result, express half the amount of apoC-III present in noncarriers. Mutation carriers compared with noncarriers had lower fasting and postprandial serum triglycerides, higher levels of HDL-cholesterol and lower levels of LDL-cholesterol. Subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary artery calcification, was less common in carriers than noncarriers, which suggests that lifelong deficiency of apoC-III has a cardioprotective effect.	 18574091 18440328 18399797 18367736 18279736 18000086 17671086 17635891 17635890 17307968 17261661 17190864 16554528 16461842 16365194 9644970 9603539 8831913 7600129 8089130 2022742 2506176 3118360 11034934 3095375 3949020 6402711 4718953 11060345 7078608
19096518	Novel association of HK1 with glycated hemoglobin in a non-diabetic population: a genome-wide evaluation of 14,618 participants in the Women's Genome Health Study.	Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. While genetic variants have been found to influence the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, relatively few studies have focused on genes associated with glycated hemoglobin, an index of the mean blood glucose concentration of the preceding 8-12 weeks. Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials have documented the relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels and the development of long-term complications in diabetes; moreover, higher glycated hemoglobin levels in the subdiabetic range have been shown to predict type 2 diabetes risk and cardiovascular disease. To examine the common genetic determinants of glycated hemoglobin levels, we performed a genome-wide association study that evaluated 337,343 SNPs in 14,618 apparently healthy Caucasian women. The results show that glycated hemoglobin levels are associated with genetic variation at the GCK (rs730497; P = 2.8 x 10(-12)), SLC30A8 (rs13266634; P = 9.8 x 10(-8)), G6PC2 (rs1402837; P = 6.8 x 10(-10)), and HK1 (rs7072268; P = 6.4 x 10(-9)) loci. While associations at the GCK, SLC30A8, and G6PC2 loci are confirmatory, the findings at HK1 are novel. We were able to replicate this novel association in an independent validation sample of 455 additional non-diabetic men and women. HK1 encodes the enzyme hexokinase, the first step in glycolysis and a likely candidate for the control of glucose metabolism. This observed genetic association between glycated hemoglobin levels and HK1 polymorphisms paves the way for further studies of the role of HK1 in hemoglobin glycation, glucose metabolism, and diabetes.	 11968088 17118959 15105499 15331542 15381514 7468617 6690962 2642375 8366922 8849753 9028305 9742976 15677518 15753114 15705809 15789306 16051738 16382908 16862161 16984975 17095908 17186458 17293876 17352422 17463246 17463248 18521185 17705672 17463249 17679132 17701901 17703236 17760500 17786204 17851648 17943122 18008060 18070814 18162508 17900590 18316358 18346983 18372903 18451265 14500039
19107115	Genome-wide association study of recurrent major depressive disorder in two European case-control cohorts.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent disorder with substantial heritability. Heritability has been shown to be substantial and higher in the variant of MDD characterized by recurrent episodes of depression. Genetic studies have thus far failed to identify clear and consistent evidence of genetic risk factors for MDD. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two independent datasets. The first GWAS was performed on 1022 recurrent MDD patients and 1000 controls genotyped on the Illumina 550 platform. The second was conducted on 492 recurrent MDD patients and 1052 controls selected from a population-based collection, genotyped on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform. Neither GWAS identified any SNP that achieved GWAS significance. We obtained imputed genotypes at the Illumina loci for the individuals genotyped on the Affymetrix platform, and performed a meta-analysis of the two GWASs for this common set of approximately half a million SNPs. The meta-analysis did not yield genome-wide significant results either. The results from our study suggest that SNPs with substantial odds ratio are unlikely to exist for MDD, at least in our datasets and among the relatively common SNPs genotyped or tagged by the half-million-loci arrays. Meta-analysis of larger datasets is warranted to identify SNPs with smaller effects or with rarer allele frequencies that contribute to the risk of MDD.	
19125160	Examination of the current top candidate genes for AD in a genome-wide association study.	With the advent of technologies that allow simultaneous genotyping of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome, the genetic contributions to complex diseases can be explored at an unprecedented detail. This study is among the first to apply the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to Alzheimer disease (AD). We present our GWAS results from the German population for genes included in the 'Top Results' list on the AlzGene database website. In addition to the apolipoprotein E locus, we identified nominally significant association signals in six of the ten genes investigated, albeit predominantly for SNPs other than those already published as being disease associated. Further, all of the four AD genes previously identified through GWAS also showed nominally significant association signals in our data. The results of our comparative study reinforce the necessity for replication and validation, not only of GWAS but also of candidate gene case-control studies, in different populations. Furthermore, cross-platform comparison of genotyping results can also identify new association signals. Finally, our data confirm that GWAS, regardless of the platform, are valuable for the identification of genetic variants associated with AD.	
19151717	Sequence variants at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus associate with many cancer types.	The common sequence variants that have recently been associated with cancer risk are particular to a single cancer type or at most two. Following up on our genome-wide scan of basal cell carcinoma, we found that rs401681[C] on chromosome 5p15.33 satisfied our threshold for genome-wide significance (OR = 1.25, P = 3.7 x 10(-12)). We tested rs401681 for association with 16 additional cancer types in over 30,000 cancer cases and 45,000 controls and found association with lung cancer (OR = 1.15, P = 7.2 x 10(-8)) and urinary bladder, prostate and cervix cancer (ORs = 1.07-1.31, all P < 4 x 10(-4)). However, rs401681[C] seems to confer protection against cutaneous melanoma (OR = 0.88, P = 8.0 x 10(-4)). Notably, most of these cancer types have a strong environmental component to their risk. Investigation of the region led us to rs2736098[A], which showed stronger association with some cancer types. However, neither variant could fully account for the association of the other. rs2736098 corresponds to A305A in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein and rs401681 is in an intron of the CLPTM1L gene.	 17401366 18391951 17618282 12928346 18086770 12216070 18264096 17529967 16682969 18849993 18385676 16112303 17529974 18385738 11162647 18668136 17401363 18264097 17401364 17545637 18385739 7977349 17618284 18794855 18488027 11572773 18372905 18328944 9576930 17533048
19165232	Genome-wide association study of panic disorder in the Japanese population.	Panic disorder (PD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Although a number of association studies have been conducted, no gene has been identified as a susceptibility locus. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study of PD in 200 Japanese patients and the same number of controls, using the GeneChip Human Mapping 500 K Array Set. Genotypes were determined using the Bayesian Robust Linear Model with Mahalanobis (BRLMM) genotype calling algorithm. The genotype data were data-cleaned using criteria for SNP call rate (>or=95%), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>or=0.1%) and minor allele frequency (>or=5%). The significance level of the allele P-value was set at 1.0 x 10(-6), to make false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. As a result, seven SNPs were significantly associated with PD, which were located in or adjacent to genes including PKP1, PLEKHG1, TMEM16B, CALCOCO1, SDK2 and CLU (or APO-J). Studies with other samples are required to confirm the results.	
19169255	Psoriasis genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility variants within LCE gene cluster at 1q21.	We report the first large genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Chinese population to identify susceptibility variants for psoriasis using a two-stage case-control design. In the first stage, we carried out a genome-wide association analysis in 1,139 cases and 1,132 controls of Chinese Han ancestry using Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChips. In the second stage, we took top SNPs forward for replication in two independent samples of 5,182 cases and 6,516 controls of Chinese Han ancestry, and 539 cases and 824 controls of Chinese Uygur ancestry. In addition to the strong replication for two known susceptibility loci MHC (rs1265181, P = 1.93 x 10(-208), OR = 22.62) and IL12B (rs3213094, P(combined) = 2.58 x 10(-26), OR = 0.78), we identified a new susceptibility locus within the LCE gene cluster on 1q21 (rs4085613, P(combined) = 6.69 x 10(-30), OR = 0.76).	 16862161 1303269 17388919 17878941 11350120 12413772 18369459 4056119 16642438 18369457 15708932 17236132 8341667 12390189 18437204 18129645 6736341 13655060 9735374 15872205 17701901 8618063 18364390 17554368 15175054 17587057 16138103
19169254	Genome-wide scan reveals association of psoriasis with IL-23 and NF-kappaB pathways.	Psoriasis is a common immune-mediated disorder that affects the skin, nails and joints. To identify psoriasis susceptibility loci, we genotyped 438,670 SNPs in 1,409 psoriasis cases and 1,436 controls of European ancestry. We followed up 21 promising SNPs in 5,048 psoriasis cases and 5,041 controls. Our results provide strong support for the association of at least seven genetic loci and psoriasis (each with combined P < 5 x 10(-8)). Loci with confirmed association include HLA-C, three genes involved in IL-23 signaling (IL23A, IL23R, IL12B), two genes that act downstream of TNF-alpha and regulate NF-kappaB signaling (TNIP1, TNFAIP3) and two genes involved in the modulation of Th2 immune responses (IL4, IL13). Although the proteins encoded in these loci are known to interact biologically, we found no evidence for epistasis between associated SNPs. Our results expand the catalog of genetic loci implicated in psoriasis susceptibility and suggest priority targets for study in other auto-immune disorders.	 11009421 19169253 12644634 14614151 7066192 8304761 16642438 17032986 17074928 17236132 17287478 17314973 17375096 17463248 17554261 17668381 17728769 17943122 17982456 18059266 18075513 18369459 18390736 18391950 18364390 18802076 19165918 19165919 11410193

In order to search for sequence variants conferring risk of thyroid cancer we conducted a genome-wide association study in 192 and 37,196 Icelandic cases and controls, respectively, followed by a replication study in individuals of European descent. Here we show that two common variants, located on 9q22.33 and 14q13.3, are associated with the disease. Overall, the strongest association signals were observed for rs965513 on 9q22.33 (OR = 1.75; P = 1.7 x 10(-27)) and rs944289 on 14q13.3 (OR = 1.37; P = 2.0 x 10(-9)). The gene nearest to the 9q22.33 locus is FOXE1 (TTF2) and NKX2-1 (TTF1) is among the genes located at the 14q13.3 locus. Both variants contribute to an increased risk of both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. Approximately 3.7% of individuals are homozygous for both variants, and their estimated risk of thyroid cancer is 5.7-fold greater than that of noncarriers. In a study on a large sample set from the general population, both risk alleles are associated with low concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the 9q22.33 allele is associated with low concentration of thyroxin (T(4)) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T(3)).	 11315092 15864278 12203737 18391951 17012270 16669872 19164563 11303513 11039572 15739211 15630470 11762722 9697704 15581879 9697705 14517540 17603485 3500674 19147577 11979442 19151717 16557281 13655060 18559567 7932824 18474871 17131411
19198610	Sequence variants affecting eosinophil numbers associate with asthma and myocardial infarction.	Eosinophils are pleiotropic multifunctional leukocytes involved in initiation and propagation of inflammatory responses and thus have important roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Here we describe a genome-wide association scan for sequence variants affecting eosinophil counts in blood of 9,392 Icelanders. The most significant SNPs were studied further in 12,118 Europeans and 5,212 East Asians. SNPs at 2q12 (rs1420101), 2q13 (rs12619285), 3q21 (rs4857855), 5q31 (rs4143832) and 12q24 (rs3184504) reached genome-wide significance (P = 5.3 x 10(-14), 5.4 x 10(-10), 8.6 x 10(-17), 1.2 x 10(-10) and 6.5 x 10(-19), respectively). A SNP at IL1RL1 associated with asthma (P = 5.5 x 10(-12)) in a collection of ten different populations (7,996 cases and 44,890 controls). SNPs at WDR36, IL33 and MYB that showed suggestive association with eosinophil counts were also associated with atopic asthma (P = 4.2 x 10(-6), 2.2 x 10(-5) and 2.4 x 10(-4), respectively). We also found that a nonsynonymous SNP at 12q24, in SH2B3, associated significantly (P = 8.6 x 10(-8)) with myocardial infarction in six different populations (6,650 cases and 40,621 controls).	 18382474 12045236 18384431 15944327 16255080 14564341 18539196 18311140 12070287 18439550 17712044 12752680 16118232 16286016 14517540 17554260 18385739 15375267 16142237 17554300 17592125 18488027 18327257 17185418 17079688 15514657 18774397 15177553
19198611	Genome-wide haplotype association study identifies the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster as a risk locus for coronary artery disease.	We identify the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster as a strong susceptibility locus for coronary artery disease (CAD) through a genome-wide haplotype association (GWHA) study. This locus was not identified from previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies focused on univariate analyses of SNPs. The proposed approach may have wide utility for analyzing GWA data for other complex traits.	 12578871 16490960 16032514 15710764 1386087 16099744 8139085 17554300 17634449 10407493 18224336 1534257
19221038	A novel variant on chromosome 7q22.3 associated with mean platelet volume, counts, and function.	Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count (PLT) are highly heritable and tightly regulated traits. We performed a genome-wide association study for MPV and identified one SNP, rs342293, as having highly significant and reproducible association with MPV (per-G allele effect 0.016 +/- 0.001 log fL; P < 1.08 x 10(-24)) and PLT (per-G effect -4.55 +/- 0.80 10(9)/L; P < 7.19 x 10(-8)) in 8586 healthy subjects. Whole-genome expression analysis in the 1-MB region showed a significant association with platelet transcript levels for PIK3CG (n = 35; P = .047). The G allele at rs342293 was also associated with decreased binding of annexin V to platelets activated with collagen-related peptide (n = 84; P = .003). The region 7q22.3 identifies the first QTL influencing platelet volume, counts, and function in healthy subjects. Notably, the association signal maps to a chromosome region implicated in myeloid malignancies, indicating this site as an important regulatory site for hematopoiesis. The identification of loci regulating MPV by this and other studies will increase our insight in the processes of megakaryopoiesis and proplatelet formation, and it may aid the identification of genes that are somatically mutated in essential thrombocytosis.	 10601342 18178591 10828025 11418466 11511514 11731797 11756194 12149212 12824346 12871299 14515197 14702636 14713950 15343390 1683417 8202160 7774011 8772233 9192642 9450519 9465064 9488697 15265786 15870178 16102044 16754721 16670270 17151367 17192395 17046049 17554300 17572673 18065693 18327256 18391950 18391952 18455228 18454148 18539110 18539114 18569861 19429868 17557178 17663743 17701901 17916723 18223171 10723803

19230858	A genome-wide analysis identifies genetic variants in the RELN gene associated with otosclerosis.	Otosclerosis is a common form of progressive hearing loss, characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the otic capsule. The etiology of the disease is largely unknown, and both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated. To identify genetic factors involved in otosclerosis, we used a case-control discovery group to complete a genome-wide association (GWA) study with 555,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), utilizing pooled DNA samples. By individual genotyping of the top 250 SNPs in a stepwise strategy, we were able to identify two highly associated SNPs that replicated in two additional independent populations. We then genotyped 79 tagSNPs to fine map the two genomic regions defined by the associated SNPs. The region with the strongest association signal, p(combined) = 6.23 x 10(-10), is on chromosome 7q22.1 and spans intron 1 to intron 4 of reelin (RELN), a gene known for its role in neuronal migration. Evidence for allelic heterogeneity was found in this region. Consistent with the GWA data, expression of RELN was confirmed in the inner ear and in stapes footplate specimens. In conclusion, we provide evidence that implicates RELN in the pathogenesis of otosclerosis.	 9182958 15272419 18578524 11170898 12719379 11735033 10821263 18224337 16244653 12642066 14570962 16255080 18276640 15173231 17588962 3344216 9425236 17489845 9337136 15297300 12567189 15321696 14563999 10192793 18491423 4827586 17213839 8588610 11689558 7829101 17924341 16138915 11568664 16618911 12114476 17291332 18021008 12778121 17160900 5907023 17696989 20895731
19249006	Genome-wide association and follow-up replication studies identified ADAMTS18 and TGFBR3 as bone mass candidate genes in different ethnic groups.	To identify and validate genes associated with bone mineral density (BMD), which is a prominent osteoporosis risk factor, we tested 379,319 SNPs in 1000 unrelated white U.S. subjects for associations with BMD. For replication, we genotyped the most significant SNPs in 593 white U.S. families (1972 subjects), a Chinese hip fracture (HF) sample (350 cases, 350 controls), a Chinese BMD sample (2955 subjects), and a Tobago cohort of African ancestry (908 males). Publicly available Framingham genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (2953 whites) were also used for in silico replication. The GWAS detected two BMD candidate genes, ADAMTS18 (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 18) and TGFBR3 (transforming growth factor, beta receptor III). Replication studies verified the significant findings by GWAS. We also detected significant associations with hip fracture for ADAMTS18 SNPs in the Chinese HF sample. Meta-analyses supported the significant associations of ADAMTS18 and TGFBR3 with BMD (p values: 2.56 x 10(-5) to 2.13 x 10(-8); total sample size: n = 5925 to 9828). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the minor allele of one significant ADAMTS18 SNP might promote binding of the TEL2 factor, which may repress ADAMTS18 expression. The data from NCBI GEO expression profiles also showed that ADAMTS18 and TGFBR3 genes were differentially expressed in subjects with normal skeletal fracture versus subjects with nonunion skeletal fracture. Overall, the evidence supports that ADAMTS18 and TGFBR3 might underlie BMD determination in the major human ethnic groups.	 16862161 16845089 16995806 17522711 17903291 17874032 18184661 18349089 18372903 18325910 18776929 18992858 10780863 10828014 11108721 12037407 12454799 12740006 12773577 12958365 14574571 14691541 1615761 7709929 9240722 9701467 15523071 15297300 16135132 16355284 16282694 16455317 16475872 16908916
19247474	Genome-wide and candidate gene association study of cigarette smoking behaviors.	The contribution of common genetic variation to one or more established smoking behaviors was investigated in a joint analysis of two genome wide association studies (GWAS) performed as part of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project in 2,329 men from the Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Trial, and 2,282 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). We analyzed seven measures of smoking behavior, four continuous (cigarettes per day [CPD], age at initiation of smoking, duration of smoking, and pack years), and three binary (ever versus never smoking, < or = 10 versus > 10 cigarettes per day [CPDBI], and current versus former smoking). Association testing for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was conducted by study and adjusted for age, cohabitation/marital status, education, site, and principal components of population substructure. None of the SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (p<10(-7)) in any combined analysis pooling evidence for association across the two studies; we observed between two and seven SNPs with p<10(-5) for each of the seven measures. In the chr15q25.1 region spanning the nicotinic receptors CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, we identified multiple SNPs associated with CPD (p<10(-3)), including rs1051730, which has been associated with nicotine dependence, smoking intensity and lung cancer risk. In parallel, we selected 11,199 SNPs drawn from 359 a priori candidate genes and performed individual-gene and gene-group analyses. After adjusting for multiple tests conducted within each gene, we identified between two and five genes associated with each measure of smoking behavior. Besides CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, MAOA was associated with CPDBI (gene-level p<5.4x10(-5)), our analysis provides independent replication of the association between the chr15q25.1 region and smoking intensity and data for multiple other loci associated with smoking behavior that merit further follow-up.	 16671072 16862161 12564384 15170444 15266341 15500307 7550364 8774539 9521442 9596006 9641486 10364535 10451441 15520277 15308589 15697051 15735609 17763112 17855705 17885625 17898222 17978999 17979512 18041664 16763378 16936733 16960812 16874522 16207390 17081982 17112802 17179752 12740294 12815741 12902625 14557728 14639705 14679582 14975165 15048644 15007373 15192278 15211640 17135278 17158188 17237345 16859748 17372231 17436240 17179996 17454707 17401363 17529973 10597412 10822347 10975602 11105655 11189684 11280926 11303596 11793788 11805739 12045467 12111919 12492752 12563176 17888884 18205015 18188666 17579606 18227835 18385720 18385738 18385739 18385676 18460664 18190672 18618000 17966091 15653710 15790597 16041240 16157522 16222627 16176798 16472381 16539894 16374522
19268274	Genome-wide association and replication studies identified TRHR as an important gene for lean body mass.	Low lean body mass (LBM) is related to a series of health problems, such as osteoporotic fracture and sarcopenia. Here we report a genome-wide association (GWA) study on LBM variation, by using Affymetrix 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. In the GWA scan, we tested 379,319 eligible SNPs in 1,000 unrelated US whites and found that two SNPs, rs16892496 (p = 7.55 x 10(-8)) and rs7832552 (p = 7.58 x 10(-8)), within the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) gene were significantly associated with LBM. Subjects carrying unfavorable genotypes at rs16892496 and rs7832552 had, on average, 2.70 and 2.55 kg lower LBM, respectively, compared to those with alternative genotypes. We replicated the significant associations in three independent samples: (1) 1488 unrelated US whites, (2) 2955 Chinese unrelated subjects, and (3) 593 nuclear families comprising 1972 US whites. Meta-analyses of the GWA scan and the replication studies yielded p values of 5.53 x 10(-9) for rs16892496 and 3.88 x 10(-10) for rs7832552. In addition, we found significant interactions between rs16892496 and polymorphisms of several other genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid and the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-I axes. Results of this study, together with the functional relevance of TRHR in muscle metabolism, support the TRHR gene as an important gene for LBM variation.	 10835412 17785429 18180959 11299268 11315092 11923910 11953652 12030918 12454799 12888987 7853237 7493198 8828882 9141550 9421240 9440393 10426699 15800289 15657097 16124998 16267090 16456199 16629538 16862161 10690945
19278955	Common susceptibility alleles are unlikely to contribute as strongly as the FV and ABO loci to VTE risk: results from a GWAS approach.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complex disease that has a major genetic component of risk. To identify genetic factors that may modify the risk of VTE, we conducted a genome-wide association study by analyzing approximately 317 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 453 VTE cases and 1327 controls. Only 3 SNPs located in the FV and ABO blood group genes were found associated with VTE at a genome-wide significant level of 1.7 x 10(-7). Detailed analysis of these SNPs in additional cohorts of more than 1700 cases and 1400 controls revealed that the association observed at the FV locus was the result of the increased risk mediated by the FV Leiden mutation, whereas O and A2 blood groups were found to be at lower risk for VTE. Apart from the FV and ABO loci, no other locus was found strongly associated with VTE. However, using this large cohort of subjects, we were able to replicate the mild effects of 2 nonsynonymous SNPs, rs1613662 in GP6 and rs13146272 in CYP4V2, recently suspected to be associated with VTE.

19359809	Identification of genetic markers associated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol by genome-wide screening in a Japanese population: the Suita study.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes or loci affecting lipid levels. Given the difference in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns across the populations, a GWAS was conducted using the Illumina 550K in a Japanese population (n=900) in search of population-specific genetic variations associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol.	
19367585	A genome screen of successful aging without cognitive decline identifies LRP1B by haplotype analysis.	Successful aging without cognitive decline (SA) is apparent in those who escape age-related illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia. To determine whether there are protective genotypes that increase the probability of successful cognitive aging, a genome-wide screen was conducted on subjects who were 85 years of older, had MMSE scores >26, and had no major illnesses. SNP 500K microarrays were used. The data from the microarrays was analyzed versus that from Alzheimer's patients. Three SNPs in the gene for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) had significant P values, after Bonferroni correction. Additional SNPs were analyzed in this very large gene. Haplotypes in intron 18 were significant for successful aging versus Alzheimer's patients; those haplotypes were not significant when Alzheimer's patients versus CEPH controls were analyzed. These results suggest that haplotypes in the gene LRP1B are significant/protective for successful aging without cognitive decline.	
19396169	A large-scale genome-wide association study of Asian populations uncovers genetic factors influencing eight quantitative traits.	To identify genetic factors influencing quantitative traits of biomedical importance, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 8,842 samples from population-based cohorts recruited in Korea. For height and body mass index, most variants detected overlapped those reported in European samples. For the other traits examined, replication of promising GWAS signals in 7,861 independent Korean samples identified six previously unknown loci. For pulse rate, signals reaching genome-wide significance mapped to chromosomes 1q32 (rs12731740, P = 2.9 x 10(-9)) and 6q22 (rs12110693, P = 1.6 x 10(-9)), with the latter approximately 400 kb from the coding sequence of GJA1. For systolic blood pressure, the most compelling association involved chromosome 12q21 and variants near the ATP2B1 gene (rs17249754, P = 1.3 x 10(-7)). For waist-hip ratio, variants on chromosome 12q24 (rs2074356, P = 7.8 x 10(-12)) showed convincing associations, although no regional transcript has strong biological candidacy. Finally, we identified two loci influencing bone mineral density at multiple sites. On chromosome 7q31, rs7776725 (within the FAM3C gene) was associated with bone density at the radius (P = 1.0 x 10(-11)), tibia (P = 1.6 x 10(-6)) and heel (P = 1.9 x 10(-10)). On chromosome 7p14, rs1721400 (mapping close to SFRP4, a frizzled protein gene) showed consistent associations at the same three sites (P = 2.2 x 10(-3), P = 1.4 x 10(-7) and P = 6.0 x 10(-4), respectively). This large-scale GWA analysis of well-characterized Korean population-based samples highlights previously unknown biological pathways.	 16862161 18391951 16959614 17002585 17907918 15236905 18391950 17434869 17572673 17786212 18064002 8697713 15277701 15078854 18454148 18428424 17554300 18325910 16267090 17401374 15178683 1310307 18391952 17632690 10657632 18166153 11855950
19401414	Confirmation of multiple risk Loci and genetic impacts by a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.	To identify novel type 2 diabetes gene variants and confirm previously identified ones, a three-staged genome-wide association study was performed in the Japanese population.	 14388528 18443202 17463246 11315092 17848626 18375949 16862161 15840754 17982410 17463249 17245589 17846125 17943122 17785532 17909877 18413217 18469204 16043441 17460697 18711367 15111519 17003336 17846126 15490285 18817904 17603485 17463248 18711366 17928989 18591388 17340123 16534212 17293876 18477659 17554300 15589065 18633108 17701901 18372903 11289058 18256235 18097733 19165915 18162508 15254872 17603484 17668382 17476472 16642978 17846124
19430483	Genome-wide association study identifies eight loci associated with blood pressure.	Elevated blood pressure is a common, heritable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. To date, identification of common genetic variants influencing blood pressure has proven challenging. We tested 2.5 million genotyped and imputed SNPs for association with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 34,433 subjects of European ancestry from the Global BPgen consortium and followed up findings with direct genotyping (N ≤ 71,225 European ancestry, N ≤ 12,889 Indian Asian ancestry) and in silico comparison (CHARGE consortium, N = 29,136). We identified association between systolic or diastolic blood pressure and common variants in eight regions near the CYP17A1 (P = 7 × 10(-24)), CYP1A2 (P = 1 × 10(-23)), FGF5 (P = 1 × 10(-21)), SH2B3 (P = 3 × 10(-18)), MTHFR (P = 2 × 10(-13)), c10orf107 (P = 1 × 10(-9)), ZNF652 (P = 5 × 10(-9)) and PLCD3 (P = 1 × 10(-8)) genes. All variants associated with continuous blood pressure were associated with dichotomous hypertension. These associations between common variants and blood pressure and hypertension offer mechanistic insights into the regulation of blood pressure and may point to novel targets for interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease.	 16224025 16301342 16522833 16494531 16530748 17128211 17554300 17554260 17572673 17671421 17903302 17726486 18193044 18268143 18079413 18311140 18348202 18391953 18443236 18454148 18593525 19079261 19198610 19219041 11239411 11315092 12070287 12215486 12377087 12423980 12493255 12925450 14671162 14741909 15001451 730822 474567 2807518 8166143 7839143 8554066 8528245 8841184 9192280 9326943 10358057 15831820 15888480 16152135
19430480	Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis find that over 40 loci affect risk of type 1 diabetes.	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. We report the findings of a genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D in the meta-analysis (P < 10(-6)). After excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated (P < 0.01; overall P < 5 × 10(-8)) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P < 0.05). The many new candidate genes suggested by these results include IL10, IL19, IL20, GLIS3, CD69 and IL27.	 18441336 17554300 12882858 14614235 15004560 15461798 6363172 8817351 16155052 16775037 19956108 17554260 17632545 17676041 17846035 18004301 17486107 18292987 18198356 18305142 16525420 16699517 16715098 18978792 19073967 19110536 18647951
19451621	Reduced expression of the Kinesin-Associated Protein 3 (KIFAP3) gene increases survival in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons that typically develops in the 6th decade and is uniformly fatal, usually within 5 years. To identify genetic variants associated with susceptibility and phenotypes in sporadic ALS, we performed a genome-wide SNP analysis in sporadic ALS cases and controls. A total of 288,357 SNPs were screened in a set of 1,821 sporadic ALS cases and 2,258 controls from the U.S. and Europe. Survival analysis was performed using 1,014 deceased sporadic cases. Top results for susceptibility were further screened in an independent sample set of 538 ALS cases and 556 controls. SNP rs1541160 within the KIFAP3 gene (encoding a kinesin-associated protein) yielded a genome-wide significant result (P = 1.84 x 10(-8)) that withstood Bonferroni correction for association with survival. Homozygosity for the favorable allele (CC) conferred a 14.0 months survival advantage. Sequence, genotypic and functional analyses revealed that there is linkage disequilibrium between rs1541160 and SNP rs522444 within the KIFAP3 promoter and that the favorable alleles of rs1541160 and rs522444 correlate with reduced KIFAP3 expression. No SNPs were associated with risk of sporadic ALS, site of onset, or age of onset. We have identified a variant within the KIFAP3 gene that is associated with decreased KIFAP3 expression and increased survival in sporadic ALS. These findings support the view that genetic factors modify phenotypes in this disease and that cellular motor proteins are determinants of motor neuron viability.	 15867925 15546588 17463246 17463248 17463249 17554300 16415888 16501576 16822964 16822965 17116639 17293876 17362836 17418584 17703236 17671248 17660816 17660817 17660530 17827064 18084291 18057069 18309045 18372902 18996918 19088126 19251627 19251628 10964600 11208056 11274309 11389829 11586297 11586298 12620113 12627231 12730604 12847526 15106121 15372378 4051456 2416263 3960325 8446170 9029070 9585359 17460697

19465909	Genome-wide and fine-resolution association analysis of malaria in West Africa.	We report a genome-wide association (GWA) study of severe malaria in The Gambia. The initial GWA scan included 2,500 children genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K GeneChip, and a replication study included 3,400 children. We used this to examine the performance of GWA methods in Africa. We found considerable population stratification, and also that signals of association at known malaria resistance loci were greatly attenuated owing to weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). To investigate possible solutions to the problem of low LD, we focused on the HbS locus, sequencing this region of the genome in 62 Gambian individuals and then using these data to conduct multipoint imputation in the GWA samples. This increased the signal of association, from P = 4 × 10(-7) to P = 4 × 10(-14), with the peak of the signal located precisely at the HbS causal variant. Our findings provide proof of principle that fine-resolution multipoint imputation, based on population-specific sequencing data, can substantially boost authentic GWA signals and enable fine mapping of causal variants in African populations.	 16551469 16532393 18348202 18568023 19079050 16715099 17688704 17355169 18177777 18003641 18048408 18300295 10835412 11001883 11103309 11423617 12154384 15198952 6584911 6097112 3713863 3318021 2898142 2690177 7723795 7617034 9988317 15759000 15769889 16259530 16862161 17057719 17554300 17572673 17943122 16255080 16244653 16715096
19483682	Common variation in KITLG and at 5q31.3 predisposes to testicular germ cell cancer.	Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) have been expected to have a strong underlying genetic component. We conducted a genome-wide scan among 277 TGCT cases and 919 controls and found that seven markers at 12p22 within KITLG (c-KIT ligand) reached genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in discovery). In independent replication, TGCT risk was increased threefold per copy of the major allele at rs3782179 and rs4474514 (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13; OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13, respectively). We found associations with rs4324715 and rs6897876 at 5q31.3 near SPRY4 (sprouty 4; P < 5.0 x 10(-6) in discovery). In independent replication, risk of TGCT was increased nearly 40% per copy of the major allele (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14-1.64; OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.16-1.66, respectively). All of the genotypes were associated with both seminoma and nonseminoma TGCT subtypes. These results demonstrate that common genetic variants affect TGCT risk and implicate KITLG and SPRY4 as genes involved in TGCT susceptibility.	 15917341 16172230 18083106 18184914 18398418 18593919 18776908 16129412 16284378 16380914 16407372 16421597 17107997 17258089 17554300 17572673 17701901 17943122 17952075 10655061 10655070 11315092 11493923 11979442 12717443 12939459 15208620 9413462 15738984
19483685	HLA-B*5701 genotype is a major determinant of drug-induced liver injury due to flucloxacillin.	Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important cause of serious liver disease. The antimicrobial agent flucloxacillin is a common cause of DILI, but the genetic basis for susceptibility remains unclear. We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study using 866,399 markers in 51 cases of flucloxacillin DILI and 282 controls matched for sex and ancestry. The GWA showed an association peak in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region with the strongest association (P = 8.7 x 10(-33)) seen for rs2395029[G], a marker in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-B*5701. Further MHC genotyping, which included 64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls, confirmed the association with HLA-B*5701 (OR = 80.6, P = 9.0 x 10(-19)). The association was replicated in a second cohort of 23 cases. In HLA-B*5701 carrier cases, rs10937275 in ST6GAL1 on chromosome 3 also showed genome-wide significance (OR = 4.1, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)). These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of flucloxacillin DILI and have the potential to substantially improve diagnosis of this serious disease.	 18684101 18301416 18549801 17463246 11409940 2764209 15122773 16862161 5481218 10535882 11034591 19079261 8443520 15963097 16719392 18382088 1506634 18760391 1730763 9391255 18852200 12143055 18758442 8023317 16849643 12620970 12484709 17505501 11726000 17701901 18485518 17641165 15016758 9214463 8229110 6413502
19488044	Genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder in European American and African American individuals.	To identify bipolar disorder (BD) genetic susceptibility factors, we conducted two genome-wide association (GWA) studies: one involving a sample of individuals of European ancestry (EA; n=1001 cases; n=1033 controls), and one involving a sample of individuals of African ancestry (AA; n=345 cases; n=670 controls). For the EA sample, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest statistical evidence for association included rs5907577 in an intergenic region at Xq27.1 (P=1.6 x 10(-6)) and rs10193871 in NAP5 at 2q21.2 (P=9.8 x 10(-6)). For the AA sample, SNPs with the strongest statistical evidence for association included rs2111504 in DPY19L3 at 19q13.11 (P=1.5 x 10(-6)) and rs2769605 in NTRK2 at 9q21.33 (P=4.5 x 10(-5)). We also investigated whether we could provide support for three regions previously associated with BD, and we showed that the ANK3 region replicates in our sample, along with some support for C15Orf53; other evidence implicates BD candidate genes such as SLITRK2. We also tested the hypothesis that BD susceptibility variants exhibit genetic background-dependent effects. SNPs with the strongest statistical evidence for genetic background effects included rs11208285 in ROR1 at 1p31.3 (P=1.4 x 10(-6)), rs4657247 in RGS5 at 1q23.3 (P=4.1 x 10(-6)), and rs7078071 in BTBD16 at 10q26.13 (P=4.5 x 10(-6)). This study is the first to conduct GWA of BD in individuals of AA and suggests that genetic variations that contribute to BD may vary as a function of ancestry.	 17486107 18252211 18292342 18372903 18451988 18317468 18776908 18776909 18987709 18988837 19018231 18711365 10550853 10835412 10909856 11315092 11986984 12140781 12161822 12802785 12930761 14557068 15052270 5009428 1027738 95232 7125846 3579495 7944874 7668299 7560123 8546148 8630482 16175504 16224024 16152572 16939974 17554300 17701901 17762509
19503597	Meta-analysis of 28,141 individuals identifies common variants within five new loci that influence uric acid concentrations.	Elevated serum uric acid levels cause gout and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2x10(-201)), ABCG2 (p = 3.1x10(-26)), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0x10(-14)), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7x10(-14)), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0x10(-9)), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1x10(-8)), GCKR (p = 1.4x10(-9)), LRRC16A (p = 8.5x10(-9)), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7x10(-9)). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women. To further characterize the identified variants, we analyzed their association with a panel of metabolites. rs12356193 within SLC16A9 was associated with DL-carnitine (p = 4.0x10(-26)) and propionyl-L-carnitine (p = 5.0x10(-8)) concentrations, which in turn were associated with serum UA levels (p = 1.4x10(-57) and p = 8.1x10(-54), respectively), forming a triangle between SNP, metabolites, and UA levels. Taken together, these associations highlight additional pathways that are important in the regulation of serum uric acid levels and point toward novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent or treat hyperuricemia. In addition, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport proteins are key in regulating serum uric acid levels.	 17463246 11254897 18834718 19043545 10510291 15037815 9038591 18300295 15507132 17572673 18223129 12739169 15919000 18349750 12024214 10487540 6532339 15304510 15219812 18842065 18327256 18834626 18556336 16054028 16204163 1658794 1334752 10876004 10801388 17083620 6685961 18327257 18678614 1820474 18948099 9548391 18179892 17278930 17997608 18008060
19503088	REL, encoding a member of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, is a newly defined risk locus for rheumatoid arthritis.

Replication in independent case-control datasets comprising 2,604 cases and 2,882 controls confirmed this association, yielding an allelic OR = 1.25 (P = 3.08 x 10(-14)) for marker rs13031237 and an allelic OR = 1.21 (P = 2.60 x 10(-11)) for marker rs13017599 in the combined dataset. The combined dataset also provides definitive support for associations at both CTLA4 (rs231735; OR = 0.85; P = 6.25 x 10(-9)) and BLK (rs2736340; OR = 1.19; P = 5.69 x 10(-9)). c-Rel is an NF-kappaB family member with distinct functional properties in hematopoietic cells, and its association with rheumatoid arthritis suggests disease pathways that involve other recently identified rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility genes including CD40, TRAF1, TNFAIP3 and PRKCQ.	 18794853 19240061 18988819 19116921 19180477 18987647 10643712 11602633 11673501 12355479 12632425 12794820 15004174 15136663 3358796 15621572 15719322 16273804 17072327 16896156 17513759 17567982 17804836 17982049 17982456 18204446 18204098 18794857

We identified risk-associated SNPs on chromosome 12q13-14 (rs703842, P = 5.4 x 10(-11); rs10876994, P = 2.7 x 10(-10); rs12368653, P = 1.0 x 10(-7)) and upstream of CD40 on chromosome 20q13 (rs6074022, P = 1.3 x 10(-7); rs1569723, P = 2.9 x 10(-7)). Both loci are also associated with other autoimmune diseases. We also replicated several known MS associations (HLA-DR15, P = 7.0 x 10(-184); CD58, P = 9.6 x 10(-8); EVI5-RPL5, P = 2.5 x 10(-6); IL2RA, P = 7.4 x 10(-6); CLEC16A, P = 1.1 x 10(-4); IL7R, P = 1.3 x 10(-3); TYK2, P = 3.5 x 10(-3)) and observed a statistical interaction between SNPs in EVI5-RPL5 and HLA-DR15 (P = 0.001).	 19110536 18794857 17634462 16862161 18650830 9430604 11456302 17344890 18794853 17179460 8637903 17641030 18997785 19293837 19200528 15297300 18594491 18209094 1705564 15731360 16564577 17924348 11673504 18987646 17701901 10679076 7524518 6847134 17606874 17660530 3340277 18178859 17426912 7499834 7689748
19525953	Meta-analysis of genome scans and replication identify CD6, IRF8 and TNFRSF1A as new multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci.	We report the results of a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans for multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility that includes 2,624 subjects with MS and 7,220 control subjects. Replication in an independent set of 2,215 subjects with MS and 2,116 control subjects validates new MS susceptibility loci at TNFRSF1A (combined P = 1.59 x 10(-11)), IRF8 (P = 3.73 x 10(-9)) and CD6 (P = 3.79 x 10(-9)). TNFRSF1A harbors two independent susceptibility alleles: rs1800693 is a common variant with modest effect (odds ratio = 1.2), whereas rs4149584 is a nonsynonymous coding polymorphism of low frequency but with stronger effect (allele frequency = 0.02; odds ratio = 1.6). We also report that the susceptibility allele near IRF8, which encodes a transcription factor known to function in type I interferon signaling, is associated with higher mRNA expression of interferon-response pathway genes in subjects with MS.	 17360963 17252545 17223656 17693606 17665448 17660530 17943122 17952073 18032773 18272866 18287568 18311140 18565446 18587394 18794853 18852200 18650830 18997785 19165918 19165919 19010793 19169254 19237575 11443543 12604793 1266564 3486383 8960740 10449104 15852401 16093364 16199517 16380510 16573354 16362079 16914752 16905561 16837931 16998491 17015227 17371992 17601777
19553259	Common body mass index-associated variants confer risk of extreme obesity.	To investigate the genetic architecture of severe obesity, we performed a genome-wide association study of 775 cases and 3197 unascertained controls at approximately 550,000 markers across the autosomal genome. We found convincing association to the previously described locus including the FTO gene. We also found evidence of association at a further six of 12 other loci previously reported to influence body mass index (BMI) in the general population and one of three associations to severe childhood and adult obesity and that cases have a higher proportion of risk-conferring alleles than controls. We found no evidence of homozygosity at any locus due to identity-by-descent associating with phenotype which would be indicative of rare, penetrant alleles, nor was there excess genome-wide homozygosity in cases relative to controls. Our results suggest that variants influencing BMI also contribute to severe obesity, a condition at the extreme of the phenotypic spectrum rather than a distinct condition.	 19079261 19079260 19151714 11315092 12900793 15052270 7800704 16224025 16815794 16862161 17237739 17434869 17496892 17701901 17943122 18159244 18218107 18347269
19557161	Genome-wide association scan meta-analysis identifies three Loci influencing adiposity and fat distribution.	To identify genetic loci influencing central obesity and fat distribution, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 genome-wide association studies (GWAS, N = 38,580) informative for adult waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). We selected 26 SNPs for follow-up, for which the evidence of association with measures of central adiposity (WC and/or WHR) was strong and disproportionate to that for overall adiposity or height. Follow-up studies in a maximum of 70,689 individuals identified two loci strongly associated with measures of central adiposity; these map near TFAP2B (WC, P = 1.9x10(-11)) and MSRA (WC, P = 8.9x10(-9)). A third locus, near LYPLAL1, was associated with WHR in women only (P = 2.6x10(-8)). The variants near TFAP2B appear to influence central adiposity through an effect on overall obesity/fat-mass, whereas LYPLAL1 displays a strong female-only association with fat distribution. By focusing on anthropometric measures of central obesity and fat distribution, we have identified three loci implicated in the regulation of human adiposity.	 16135132 16271645 16373396 16954217 11315092 18391951 17496892 17246646 15940393 17658951 16373417 19151714 19079261 17059388 9845227 19117547 10678257 18391950 17434869 17572673 14624725 9491897 18346983 19089453 17609260 18839131 15862893 10519386 10933273 10742101 18454146 18852200 17767157 10988299 18958166 18971438 17463248 19005195 11731797 10070677 18454148 19060911 18391952 18372903 17991826 19060906 15028826 19215730 19079260 17956544
19561606	Sequence variants in the CLDN14 gene associate with kidney stones and bone mineral density.	Kidney stone disease is a common condition. To search for sequence variants conferring risk of kidney stones, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 3,773 cases and 42,510 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands. We discovered common, synonymous variants in the CLDN14 gene that associate with kidney stones (OR = 1.25 and P = 4.0 x 10(-12) for rs219780[C]). Approximately 62% of the general population is homozygous for rs219780[C] and is estimated to have 1.64 times greater risk of developing the disease compared to noncarriers. The CLDN14 gene is expressed in the kidney and regulates paracellular permeability at epithelial tight junctions. The same variants were also found to associate with reduced bone mineral density at the hip (P = 0.00039) and spine (P = 0.0077).	 18021006 18480174 11315092 16443041 12631132 15912382 17012270 12554675 17943122 19181680 17568781 12740490 7825619 18344981 16476706 17033971 15722591 12913076 7976495 18663477 11045395 10379732 15698445 14517540 18036336 15654335 15514891 10547847 11163249 17109061 18445777 13655060 16141795 17872384 14532161 19079262 16322055 16200192 9249770 12791041 10390358 18455228
19571809	Common variants on chromosome 6p22.1 are associated with schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia, a devastating psychiatric disorder, has a prevalence of 0.5-1%, with high heritability (80-85%) and complex transmission. Recent studies implicate rare, large, high-penetrance copy number variants in some cases, but the genes or biological mechanisms that underlie susceptibility are not known. Here we show that schizophrenia is significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the extended major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6. We carried out a genome-wide association study of common SNPs in the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) case-control sample, and then a meta-analysis of data from the MGS, International Schizophrenia Consortium and SGENE data sets. No MGS finding achieved genome-wide statistical significance. In the meta-analysis of European-ancestry subjects (8,008 cases, 19,077 controls), significant association with schizophrenia was observed in a region of linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6p22.1 (P = 9.54 x 10(-9)). This region includes a histone gene cluster and several immunity-related genes--possibly implicating aetiological mechanisms involving chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, autoimmunity and/or infection. These results demonstrate that common schizophrenia susceptibility alleles can be detected. The characterization of these signals will suggest important directions for research on susceptibility mechanisms.	 17785817 17965595 19215730 18451988 18542080 17701901 18782037 18923514 18203167 15581715 15892143 18514488
19571808	Common variants conferring risk of schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, caused by both genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders. The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the 'genomic disorders', have not yet been characterized. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2. Our findings implicating the MHC region are consistent with an immune component to schizophrenia risk, whereas the association with NRGN and TCF4 points to perturbation of pathways involved in brain development, memory and cognition.	 18627065 11343866 18668039 12802786 11315092 19029900 18668038 19165921 10835412 18929487 17140601 17671107 8421494 16513876 728011 18056542 14517540 1519449 17679634 17554300 13655060 18784092 18204446 17878293 9880498 19571811 16797925 17558408
19570815	A genome-wide association study of northwestern Europeans involves the C-type natriuretic peptide signaling pathway in the etiology of human height variation.	Northwestern Europeans are among the tallest of human populations. The increase in body height in these people appears to have reached a plateau, suggesting the ubiquitous presence of an optimal environment in which genetic factors may have exerted a particularly strong influence on human growth. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of body height using 2.2 million markers in 10 074 individuals from three Dutch and one German population-based cohorts. Upon genotyping, the 12 most significantly height-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from this GWAS in 6912 additional individuals of Dutch and Swedish origin, a genetic variant (rs6717918) on chromosome 2q37.1 was found to be associated with height at a genome-wide significance level (P(combined) = 3.4 x 10(-9)). Notably, a second SNP (rs6718438) located approximately 450 bp away and in strong LD (r(2) = 0.77) with rs6717918 was previously found to be suggestive of a height association in 29 820 individuals of mainly northwestern European ancestry, and the over-expression of a nearby natriuretic peptide precursor type C (NPPC) gene, has been associated with overgrowth and skeletal anomalies. We also found a SNP (rs10472828) located on 5p14 near the natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) gene, encoding a receptor of the NPPC ligand, to be associated with body height (P(combined) = 2.1 x 10(-7)). Taken together, these results suggest that variation in the C-type natriuretic peptide signaling pathway, involving the NPPC and NPR3 genes, plays an important role in determining human body height.	 10754982 18952825 14702637 15054401 15463971 1833235 9675778 9850346 10377427 16007330 16862161 17254420 17384015 17412655 17373680 17572673 17701901 17767157 17681481 17955331 17562543 18193045 18348202 18391950 18391951 18391952 18443579 18691889 18763692 18852200 18950892 18974171 18781184 19030899 19065144 19343178 19039035 11315092
19578179	A genome-wide association study of acenocoumarol maintenance dosage.	Several genome-wide association studies have been performed on warfarin. For acenocoumarol, the most frequently used coumarin in many countries worldwide, pharmacodynamic influences are expected to be comparable. Pharmacokinetics however might differ. We aimed to confirm known or identify new genetic variants contributing to interindividual variation on stabilized acenocoumarol dosage by a GWAS. The index population consisted of 1451 Caucasian subjects from the Rotterdam study and results were replicated in 287 subjects from the Rotterdam study extended cohort. Both cohorts were genotyped on the Illumina 550K Human Map SNP array. From polymorphisms tested for association with acenocoumarol dosage, 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 16 and 18 SNPs on chromosome 10 reached genome-wide significance. The SNP with the lowest P-value was rs10871454 on chromosome 16 linked to SNPs within the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) (P = 2.0 x 10(-123)). The lowest P-value on chromosome 10 was obtained by rs4086116 within cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (P = 3.3 x 10(-24)). After adjustment for these SNPs, the rs2108622 polymorphism within cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) gene on chromosome 19 reached genome-wide significance (P = 2.0 x 10(-8)). On chromosome 10, we further identified genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 2C18 (CYP2C18) gene contributing to variance of acenocoumarol dosage. Thus we confirmed earlier findings that acenocoumarol dosage mainly depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes. Besides age, gender, body mass index and target INR, one polymorphism within each of the VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 and CYP2C18 genes could explain 48.8% of acenocoumarol dosage variation.	
19578366	Variants in the CDKN2B and RTEL1 regions are associated with high-grade glioma susceptibility.	The causes of glioblastoma and other gliomas remain obscure. To discover new candidate genes influencing glioma susceptibility, we conducted a principal component-adjusted genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 275,895 autosomal variants among 692 adult high-grade glioma cases (622 from the San Francisco Adult Glioma Study (AGS) and 70 from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) and 3,992 controls (602 from AGS and 3,390 from Illumina iControlDB (iControls)). For replication, we analyzed the 13 SNPs with P < 10(-6) using independent data from 176 high-grade glioma cases and 174 controls from the Mayo Clinic. On 9p21, rs1412829 near CDKN2B had discovery P = 3.4 x 10(-8), replication P = 0.0038 and combined P = 1.85 x 10(-10). On 20q13.3, rs6010620 intronic to RTEL1 had discovery P = 1.5 x 10(-7), replication P = 0.00035 and combined P = 3.40 x 10(-9).

We conducted a genome-wide association study for nevus count using 297,108 SNPs in 1,524 twins, with validation in an independent cohort of 4,107 individuals. We identified strongly associated variants in MTAP, a gene adjacent to the familial melanoma susceptibility locus CDKN2A on 9p21 (rs4636294, combined P = 3.4 x 10(-15)), as well as in PLA2G6 on 22q13.1 (rs2284063, combined P = 3.4 x 10(-8)). In addition, variants in these two loci showed association with melanoma risk in 3,131 melanoma cases from two independent studies, including rs10757257 at 9p21, combined P = 3.4 x 10(-8), OR = 1.23 (95% CI = 1.15-1.30) and rs132985 at 22q13.1, combined P = 2.6 x 10(-7), OR = 1.23 (95% CI = 1.15-1.30).

19648918	Genome-wide association study identifies variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.	We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer, a cancer with one of the lowest survival rates worldwide. We genotyped 558,542 SNPs in 1,896 individuals with pancreatic cancer and 1,939 controls drawn from 12 prospective cohorts plus one hospital-based case-control study. We conducted a combined analysis of these groups plus an additional 2,457 affected individuals and 2,654 controls from eight case-control studies, adjusting for study, sex, ancestry and five principal components. We identified an association between a locus on 9q34 and pancreatic cancer marked by the SNP rs505922 (combined P = 5.37 x 10(-8); multiplicative per-allele odds ratio 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.28). This SNP maps to the first intron of the ABO blood group gene. Our results are consistent with earlier epidemiologic evidence suggesting that people with blood group O may have a lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with groups A or B.	 12566741 10835412 12837831 14520411 14575938 15059921 4888078 5027390 2442445 8205268 9091646 13032504 15540225 15789306 16236996 16054167 16415888 16862161 17352422 17554300 17529973 17194218 17699799 17582608 17943122 17628652 17764494 18031948 18264096 18287387 18263601 18464913 18559563 18544627 18596976 10718501 19276450 12015775 12111919 18604267 18940312 12639222
19648920	Genetic variation in the prostate stem cell antigen gene PSCA confers susceptibility to urinary bladder cancer.	We conducted a genome-wide association study on 969 bladder cancer cases and 957 controls from Texas. For fast-track validation, we evaluated 60 SNPs in three additional US populations and validated the top SNP in nine European populations. A missense variant (rs2294008) in the PSCA gene showed consistent association with bladder cancer in US and European populations. Combining all subjects (6,667 cases, 39,590 controls), the overall P-value was 2.14 x 10(-10) and the allelic odds ratio was 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.10-1.20). rs2294008 alters the start codon and is predicted to cause truncation of nine amino acids from the N-terminal signal sequence of the primary PSCA translation product. In vitro reporter gene assay showed that the variant allele significantly reduced promoter activity. Resequencing of the PSCA genomic region showed that rs2294008 is the only common missense SNP in PSCA. Our data identify rs2294008 as a new bladder cancer susceptibility locus.	 10713670 10891514 11226295 11279618 11406532 11857419 12771726 4008097 8709350 9465086 16112301 16230414 16686711 16737809 17401363 17401366 17361015 17529967 17618284 18287387 18488030 18794855 10973799
19654303	Deciphering the impact of common genetic variation on lung cancer risk: a genome-wide association study.	To explore the impact of common variation on the risk of developing lung cancer, we conducted a two-phase genome-wide association (GWA) study. In phase 1, we compared the genotypes of 511,919 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 1,952 cases and 1,438 controls; in phase 2, 30,568 SNPs were genotyped in 2,465 cases and 3,005 controls. SNP selection was based on best supported P values from phase 1 and two other GWA studies of lung cancer. In the combined analysis of phases 1 and 2, the strongest associations identified were defined by SNPs mapping to 15q25.1 (rs12914385; P = 3.19 x 10(-16)), 5p15.33 (rs4975616; P = 6.66 x 10(-7)), and 6p21.33 (rs3117582; P = 9.13 x 10(-7)). Variation at 15q25.1, but not 5p15.33 or 6p21.33, was strongly associated with smoking behavior with risk alleles correlated to higher consumption. Variation at 5p15.33 was shown to significantly influence induction of lung cancer histology. Pooling data from the four series provided 21,620 genotypes for 7,560 cases and 8,205 controls. A meta-analysis provided increased support that variation at 15q25.1 (rs8034191; P = 3.24 x 10(-26)), 5p15.33 (rs4975616; P = 2.99 x 10(-9)), and 6p21.33 (rs3117582; P = 4.46 x 10(-10)) influences lung cancer risk. The next best-supported associations were attained at 15q15.2 (rs748404: P = 1.08 x 10(-6)) and 10q23.31 (rs1926203; P = 1.28 x 10(-6)). These data indicate few common variants account for 1% of the excess familial risk underscoring the necessity of having additional large sample series for gene discovery.	 17403783 16155052 18385739 18385676 18715499 18957677 18978787 18978790 19151717 10891514 11162647 7914565 8944229 16160696 18385738
19664746	Genome-wide association study reveals multiple nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated loci within the HLA region at chromosome 6p21.3.	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a multifactorial malignancy closely associated with genetic factors and Epstein-Barr virus infection. To identify the common genetic variants linked to NPC susceptibility, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 277 NPC patients and 285 healthy controls within the Taiwanese population, analyzing 480,365 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Twelve statistically significant SNPs were identified and mapped to chromosome 6p21.3. Associations were replicated in two independent sets of case-control samples. Two of the most significant SNPs (rs2517713 and rs2975042; p(combined) = 3.9 x 10(-20) and 1.6 x 10(-19), respectively) were located in the HLA-A gene. Moreover, we detected significant associations between NPC and two genes: specifically, gamma aminobutyric acid b receptor 1 (GABBR1) (rs29232; p(combined) = 8.97 x 10(-17)) and HLA-F (rs3129055 and rs9258122; p(combined) = 7.36 x 10(-11) and 3.33 x 10(-10), respectively). Notably, the association of rs29232 remained significant (residual p < 5 x 10(-4)) after adjustment for age, gender, and HLA-related SNPs. Furthermore, higher GABA(B) receptor 1 expression levels can be found in the tumor cells in comparison to the adjacent epithelial cells (p < 0.001) in NPC biopsies, implying a biological role of GABBR1 in NPC carcinogenesis. To our knowledge, it is the first GWAS report of NPC showing that multiple loci (HLA-A, HLA-F, and GABBR1) within chromosome 6p21.3 are associated with NPC. Although some of these relationships may be attributed to linkage disequilibrium between the loci, the findings clearly provide a fresh direction for the study of NPC development.	 16862161 16835836 17035381 17119058 17483596 17554300 17572673 17701901 17909631 17942900 17975143 18065518 11144533 11386012 12110730 12377327 12464650 12516093 12520010 12582034 14578150 14607927 15215374 4320657 4842361 191368 215516 6874140 2377207 8376187 8547826 9133461 9505086 9670113 9690553 10385146 15297300 15729690 15950718 16912175

19684573	Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance.	Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 170 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of cirrhosis in North America. Although the recommended treatment for chronic infection involves a 48-week course of peginterferon-alpha-2b (PegIFN-alpha-2b) or -alpha-2a (PegIFN-alpha-2a) combined with ribavirin (RBV), it is well known that many patients will not be cured by treatment, and that patients of European ancestry have a significantly higher probability of being cured than patients of African ancestry. In addition to limited efficacy, treatment is often poorly tolerated because of side effects that prevent some patients from completing therapy. For these reasons, identification of the determinants of response to treatment is a high priority. Here we report that a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, encoding interferon-lambda-3 (IFN-lambda-3), is associated with an approximately twofold change in response to treatment, both among patients of European ancestry (P = 1.06 x 10(-25)) and African-Americans (P = 2.06 x 10(-3)). Because the genotype leading to better response is in substantially greater frequency in European than African populations, this genetic polymorphism also explains approximately half of the difference in response rates between African-Americans and patients of European ancestry.	 16135132 12469119 19403902 18528940 16862161 19330875 11685208 15731279 15163776 12483210 19625712 15057741 18834319 17701901 8020885 18256235 18467494
19684603	Germline genomic variants associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Using the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and publicly available genotypes, we identified 18 SNPs whose allele frequency differed significantly(P < 1 x 10(-5)) between pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (n = 317) and non-ALL controls (n = 17,958). Two SNPs in ARID5B not only differed between ALL and non-ALL groups (rs10821936, P = 1.4 x 10(-15), odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; rs10994982, P = 5.7 x 10(-9), OR = 1.62) but also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes (rs10821936, P = 1.62 x 10(-5), OR = 2.17; rs10994982, P = 0.003, OR 1.72). These ARID5B SNPs also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes in an independent validation cohort (n = 124 children with ALL; P = 0.003 and P = 0.0008, OR 2.45 and 2.86, respectively) and were associated with methotrexate accumulation and gene expression pattern in leukemic lymphoblasts. We conclude that germline variants affect susceptibility to, and characteristics of, specific ALL subtypes.	 18291030 18408710 18505952 18398821 18388178 18495205 19129520 19138562 19338077 19553647 11483573 11823363 10666194 10835412 11274424 11959810 12086872 12772088 12886244 14510941 12730115 14643094 14982958 15071128 15251979 6192907 3278171 7525652 7969165 8543809 8550853 9353182 9718381 15630450 15640446 15921520 15942938 16400611 16407512 16434385 16492768 17008550 17344859 17548681 17554300 18415801 18414197

19714249	Powerful bivariate genome-wide association analyses suggest the SOX6 gene influencing both obesity and osteoporosis phenotypes in males.	Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are normally implemented in a univariate framework and analyze different phenotypes in isolation. This univariate approach ignores the potential genetic correlation between important disease traits. Hence this approach is difficult to detect pleiotropic genes, which may exist for obesity and osteoporosis, two common diseases of major public health importance that are closely correlated genetically.	 16995807 19489754 17228994 16788566 17299077 17522711 17554300 17412698 17473065 17694346 12049882 12365955 12419242 12503980 12817771 14624725 15454942 2764403 8511983 7817832 8922639 9240722 9545015 9755172 10469292 15297300 15657097 15855352 15809668 16148004 16025191 16267090 10660043 10696282 10766250 10793644 10835412 11058432 11255018 11702786 11708718 11923910 16579875 16862161 18551125 19002143 18924135 17002564
19721433	Genome-wide pharmacogenomic analysis of response to treatment with antipsychotics.	Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness. Understanding the genetic variation affecting response to antipsychotics is important to develop novel diagnostic tests to match individual schizophrenia patients to the most effective and safe medication. In this study, we use a genome-wide approach to detect genetic variation underlying individual differences in response to treatment with the antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and perphenazine. Our sample consisted of 738 subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia who took part in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness. Subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500 K genotyping platform plus a custom 164 K chip to improve genome-wide coverage. Treatment outcome was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Our criterion for genome-wide significance was a prespecified threshold that ensures that, on an average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. The top statistical result reached significance at our prespecified threshold and involved a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an intergenic region on chromosome 4p15. In addition, SNPs in Ankyrin Repeat and Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-Containing Protein 1B (ANKS1B) and in the Contactin-Associated Protein-Like 5 gene (CNTNAP5), which mediated the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on Negative symptoms, were very close to our threshold for declaring significance. The most significant SNP in CNTNAP5 is nonsynonymous, giving rise to an amino-acid substitution. In addition to highlighting our top results, we provide all P-values for download as a resource for investigators with the requisite samples to carry out replication. This study demonstrates the potential of genome-wide association studies to discover novel genes that mediate the effects of antipsychotics, which could eventually help to tailor drug treatment to schizophrenic patients.	 17521439 17549063 17194218 17701901 17533416 17503482 17092969 17669634 17588543 18347602 18085566 19058842 18930379 19015230 19156168 14550627 14969487 15020448 15031620 15037866 15121641 3616518 7840350 9268581 9353855 9403953 9850203 10490826 15718463 15738930 15789306 15761122 15834813 15916472 16033310 16172203 16255080 16381840 10578454 10843459 10827107 10866212 10950641 11315092 11535825 11600885 11593451 12351588 12807801 12883005 12908658 16381938 16314884 16418238 16229988 16706732 16721403 16730429 16845472 16862161 17068223 17436246 17160700 17465637 17434869 17460697 17463246 17463248 17463249

Recently, associations of several common genetic variants with height have been reported in different populations. We attempted to identify further variants associated with adult height in a self-contained population (the Sorbs in Eastern Germany) as discovery set. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) (approximately 390,000 genetic polymorphisms, Affymetrix gene arrays) on adult height in 929 Sorbian individuals. Subsequently, the best SNPs (P < 0.001) were taken forward to a meta-analysis together with two independent cohorts [Diabetes Genetics Initiative, British 1958 Birth Cohort, (58BC, publicly available)]. Furthermore, we genotyped our best signal for replication in two additional German cohorts (Leipzig, n = 1044 and Berlin, n = 1728). In the primary Sorbian GWAS, we identified 5 loci with a P-value < 10(-5) and 455 SNPs with P-value < 0.001. In the meta-analysis on those 455 SNPs, only two variants in GPR133 (rs1569019 and rs1976930; in LD with each other) retained a P-value at or below 10(-6) and were associated with height in the three cohorts individually. Upon replication, the SNP rs1569019 showed significant effects on height in the Leipzig cohort (P = 0.004, beta = 1.166) and in 577 men of the Berlin cohort (P = 0.049, beta = 1.127) though not in women. The combined analysis of all five cohorts (n = 6,687) resulted in a P-value of 4.7 x 10(-8) (beta = 0.949). In conclusion, our GWAS suggests novel loci influencing height. In view of the robust replication in five different cohorts, we propose GPR133 to be a novel gene associated with adult height.	 10581024 19570815 11410839 11782049 11867360 14567953 14624724 15203201 3288229 15297300 15744036 16565746 16905557 17024364 17056209 17251915 17559308 17701901 17767157 18193045 18212126 18048501 18391950 18391951 18391952 18443579 18560445 18950892 18952825 18781184 19343178 19396169 19376282 19455035 11252747
19734545	A genome-wide study of common SNPs and CNVs in cognitive performance in the CANTAB.	Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are commonly accompanied by cognitive impairments that are treatment resistant and crucial to functional outcome. There has been great interest in studying cognitive measures as endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders, with the hope that their genetic basis will be clearer. To investigate this, we performed a genome-wide association study involving 11 cognitive phenotypes from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. We showed these measures to be heritable by comparing the correlation in 100 monozygotic and 100 dizygotic twin pairs. The full battery was tested in approximately 750 subjects, and for spatial and verbal recognition memory, we investigated a further 500 individuals to search for smaller genetic effects. We were unable to find any genome-wide significant associations with either SNPs or common copy number variants. Nor could we formally replicate any polymorphism that has been previously associated with cognition, although we found a weak signal of lower than expected P-values for variants in a set of 10 candidate genes. We additionally investigated SNPs in genomic loci that have been shown to harbor rare variants that associate with neuropsychiatric disorders, to see if they showed any suggestion of association when considered as a separate set. Only NRXN1 showed evidence of significant association with cognition. These results suggest that common genetic variation does not strongly influence cognition in healthy subjects and that cognitive measures do not represent a more tractable genetic trait than clinical endpoints such as schizophrenia. We discuss a possible role for rare variation in cognitive genomics.	 17325717 17522711 17470457 17554299 17554300 17480035 17549062 17701901 17641165 17716071 17723032 17336946 17999366 17964762 18179900 17486107 17989066 18218868 18206423 18184952 18083013 17646849 18256235 18398418 18282107 18474208 18317468 18347602 18509036 18289889 18560438 18339359 18205171 18502736 18596617 18493969 18716219 18602445 18668038 18668039 18755576 19051289 19105856 18332876 19506092 19265566 16246526 11381111 11882781 12553913 12668349 12890761 12963670 14566344 15102340 15285979 15313036 15319576 2859067 1629849 7945151 7951684 7644464 7487839 8866544 9745237 9763493 9803018 10485705 15531406 15866367 15890497 16184482 16204199 15785860 16298250 16517514 16715099 16775145 16862161 17053149 16938147 17088422 17173049 17202538 17289997 17227707 18776908 17712315 18784092 18940311 18987709 18423075 19029900 19156153 18677311 18711365 19136953 19197363 18945720 19222302 18349135 19167508 19181681 18550696 19330815 19050728 19306953 19404257 19289393
19734901	Genome-wide association study identifies 19p13.3 (UNC13A) and 9p21.2 as susceptibility loci for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	We conducted a genome-wide association study among 2,323 individuals with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 9,013 control subjects and evaluated all SNPs with P < 1.0 x 10(-4) in a second, independent cohort of 2,532 affected individuals and 5,940 controls. Analysis of the genome-wide data revealed genome-wide significance for one SNP, rs12608932, with P = 1.30 x 10(-9). This SNP showed robust replication in the second cohort (P = 1.86 x 10(-6)), and a combined analysis over the two stages yielded P = 2.53 x 10(-14). The rs12608932 SNP is located at 19p13.3 and maps to a haplotype block within the boundaries of UNC13A, which regulates the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate at neuromuscular synapses. Follow-up of additional SNPs showed genome-wide significance for two further SNPs (rs2814707, with P = 7.45 x 10(-9), and rs3849942, with P = 1.01 x 10(-8)) in the combined analysis of both stages. These SNPs are located at chromosome 9p21.2, in a linkage region for familial ALS with frontotemporal dementia found previously in several large pedigrees.	 17827064 18668039 18974171 19451621 17362836 16490960 16495328 15988013 19197363 17671248 10440375 17574095 7807156 16032514 12177636 12029063 17253460 17296840 18084291 15297300 18852200 17945153 18057069 9219739 18794855 17701901 17955331 18348202 19193627 18252225 14685227 16421333
19734902	Genome-wide association study identifies variants at CLU and PICALM associated with Alzheimer's disease.	We undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful AD GWAS to date. In stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (most significant SNP, rs2075650, P = 1.8 x 10(-157)) and observed genome-wide significant association with SNPs at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the CLU (also known as APOJ) gene (rs11136000, P = 1.4 x 10(-9)) and 5' to the PICALM gene (rs3851179, P = 1.9 x 10(-8)). These associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with Alzheimer's disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, P = 8.5 x 10(-10), odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, P = 1.3 x 10(-9), odds ratio = 0.86).	 16612103 11315092 1585460 19136949 17317784 16862161 7659297 8633046 9600986 15558718 8416966 18606306 17846035 16095541 8643484 17474819 9560017 18976728 18425821 8687416 10611368 8752142 8021238 7802679 7589331 11906815 12145324 8328966 19118814 8774959 18270320 15297300 11593451 14741101 1378350 7534068 11425896 19341505 8792817 18400162 17077814 10936885 17554300 10571241 10436022 17701901 17998437 16228001 18182011 18372903 18823527 7969426 11672811 16845085 17553421 11148253
19749758	IL28B is associated with response to chronic hepatitis C interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 3% of the world's population. Treatment of chronic HCV consists of a combination of PEGylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin (RBV). To identify genetic variants associated with HCV treatment response, we conducted a genome-wide association study of sustained virological response (SVR) to PEG-IFN-alpha/RBV combination therapy in 293 Australian individuals with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, with validation in an independent replication cohort consisting of 555 individuals. We report an association to SVR within the gene region encoding interleukin 28B (IL28B, also called IFNlambda3; rs8099917 combined P = 9.25 x 10(-9), OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.57-2.52). IL28B contributes to viral resistance and is known to be upregulated by interferons and by RNA virus infection. These data suggest that host genetics may be useful for the prediction of drug response, and they also support the investigation of the role of IL28B in the treatment of HCV and in other diseases treated with IFN-alpha.	 12469119 18987645 11315092 17194218 16862161 14996676 9861020 16244653 16023972 12111370 18996892 18587383 19238176 11583749 18692270 14980075 16364080 15114531 15208644 19104147 11404376 12407573 12407585 12029063 15699120 15731279 17006906 16415888 12692250 15297300 18369468 18761607 19304895 16611910 19300512 17554300 12324553 17701901 9423247 16241862 17785777 14991609 11095346 18250457 17087946 18208329 15928901 17267482
19754311	Genomewide association study of a rapid progression cohort identifies new susceptibility alleles for AIDS (ANRS Genomewide Association Study 03).

The discovery of genetic factors that predispose individuals to rapid progression to AIDS should also reveal new insights into the molecular etiology of the pathology.	
19767754	Genome-wide association and replication studies identify four variants associated with prostate cancer susceptibility.	We report a prostate cancer genome-wide association follow-on study. We discovered four variants associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer in several European populations: rs10934853[A] (OR = 1.12, P = 2.9 x 10(-10)) on 3q21.3; two moderately correlated (r2 = 0.07) variants, rs16902094[G] (OR = 1.21, P = 6.2 x 10(-15)) and rs445114[T] (OR = 1.14, P = 4.7 x 10(-10)), on 8q24.21; and rs8102476[C] (OR = 1.12, P = 1.6 x 10(-11)) on 19q13.2. We also refined a previous association signal on 11q13 with the SNP rs11228565[A] (OR = 1.23, P = 6.7 x 10(-12)). In a multivariate analysis using 22 prostate cancer risk variants typed in the Icelandic population, we estimated that carriers in the top 1.3% of the risk distribution are at a 2.5 times greater risk of developing the disease than members of the general population.	 17401366 17618282 18758462 18264096 17529967 18073375 17012270 16682969 18264098 16715096 14517540 17401363 18264097 17401364 17603485 3500674 15654335 16986160 18445777 19151717 13655060 18199855 18577746 17618283 17618284 18794855 19117981 17357074 18987734 18708398
19779542	A genome-wide association analysis identified a novel susceptible locus for pathological myopia at 11q24.1.	Myopia is one of the most common ocular disorders worldwide. Pathological myopia, also called high myopia, comprises 1% to 5% of the general population and is one of the leading causes of legal blindness in developed countries. To identify genetic determinants associated with pathological myopia in Japanese, we conducted a genome-wide association study, analyzing 411,777 SNPs with 830 cases and 1,911 general population controls in a two-stage design (297 cases and 934 controls in the first stage and 533 cases and 977 controls in the second stage). We selected 22 SNPs that showed P-values smaller than 10(-4) in the first stage and tested them for association in the second stage. The meta-analysis combining the first and second stages identified an SNP, rs577948, at chromosome 11q24.1, which was associated with the disease (P = 2.22x10(-7) and OR of 1.37 with 95% confidence interval: 1.21-1.54). Two genes, BLID and LOC399959, were identified within a 200-kb DNA encompassing rs577948. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that both genes were expressed in human retinal tissue. Our results strongly suggest that the region at 11q24.1 is a novel susceptibility locus for pathological myopia in Japanese.	 17114124 14388528 16303933 12477932 11315092 15761120 12714612 15761121 14711714 15868405 11752280 15761122 18160066 19324860 9596502 17922574 9792869 9634508 17210850 9040465 15078666 16648373 17327828 8981707 17065484 18201684 17690259 5524211 15297300 8801636 15273935 18421076 16710702 18243904 11328732 16877074 1980096 15307048 16052171 18846214 15069058 16647133 17701901 7187081 15671267 18535602 18045248 15980214 10937558 19122830 16501916 17053108 11133850
19786962	First genome-wide association scan on neurophysiological endophenotypes points to trans-regulation effects on SLC2A3 in dyslexic children.	Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disorders affecting about 5% of all school-aged children. It has been shown that event-related potential measurements reveal differences between dyslexic children and age-matched controls. This holds particularly true for mismatch negativity (MMN), which reflects automatic speech deviance processing and is altered in dyslexic children. We performed a whole-genome association analysis in 200 dyslexic children, focusing on MMN measurements. We identified rs4234898, a marker located on chromosome 4q32.1, to be significantly associated with the late MMN component. This association could be replicated in an independent second sample of 186 dyslexic children, reaching genome-wide significance in the combined sample (P = 5.14e-08). We also found an association between the late MMN component and a two-marker haplotype of rs4234898 and rs11100040, one of its neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the combined sample, this marker combination withstands correction for multiple testing (P = 6.71e-08). Both SNPs lie in a region devoid of any protein-coding genes; however, they both show significant association with mRNA-expression levels of SLC2A3 on chromosome 12, the predominant facilitative glucose transporter in neurons. Our results suggest a possible trans-regulation effect on SLC2A3, which might lead to glucose deficits in dyslexic children and could explain their attenuated MMN in passive listening tasks.	
19798445	Genetic determinants of circulating sphingolipid concentrations in European populations.	Sphingolipids have essential roles as structural components of cell membranes and in cell signalling, and disruption of their metabolism causes several diseases, with diverse neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic consequences. Increasingly, variants within a few of the genes that encode enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism are being associated with complex disease phenotypes. Direct experimental evidence supports a role of specific sphingolipid species in several common complex chronic disease processes including atherosclerotic plaque formation, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, pancreatic beta-cell failure, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, yet little is known about the major genetic variants that influence their circulating levels in the general population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between 318,237 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and levels of circulating sphingomyelin (SM), dihydrosphingomyelin (Dih-SM), ceramide (Cer), and glucosylceramide (GluCer) single lipid species (33 traits); and 43 matched metabolite ratios measured in 4,400 subjects from five diverse European populations. Associated variants (32) in five genomic regions were identified with genome-wide significant corrected p-values ranging down to 9.08x10(-66). The strongest associations were observed in or near 7 genes functionally involved in ceramide biosynthesis and trafficking: SPTLC3, LASS4, SGPP1, ATP10D, and FADS1-3. Variants in 3 loci (ATP10D, FADS3, and SPTLC3) associate with MI in a series of three German MI studies. An additional 70 variants across 23 candidate genes involved in sphingolipid-metabolizing pathways also demonstrate association (p = 10(-4) or less). Circulating concentrations of several key components in sphingolipid metabolism are thus under strong genetic control, and variants in these loci can be tested for a role in the development of common cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases.	 11108726 19433657 11315092 12532265 15502825 1860857 9358751 9446580 10428992 15522827 16303764 16493443 16670158 16893529 16854371 17052686 17384015 17550581 17634449 17373700 17924335 17984066 18060068 18300295 18451260 18499644 18842780 19021754 19043545 18683247 19060906 19060911 19148276 18987351 18832345 19198612 19260138 11242114
19801982	Twenty bone-mineral-density loci identified by large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.	Bone mineral density (BMD) is a heritable complex trait used in the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis and the assessment of fracture risk. We performed meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies of femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in 19,195 subjects of Northern European descent. We identified 20 BMD loci that reached genome-wide significance (GWS; P < 5 x 10(-8)), of which 13 map to regions not previously associated with this trait: 1p31.3 (GPR177), 2p21 (SPTBN1), 3p22 (CTNNB1), 4q21.1 (MEPE), 5q14 (MEF2C), 7p14 (STARD3NL), 7q21.3 (FLJ42280), 11p11.2 (LRP4, ARHGAP1, F2), 11p14.1 (DCDC5), 11p15 (SOX6), 16q24 (FOXL1), 17q21 (HDAC5) and 17q12 (CRHR1). The meta-analysis also confirmed at GWS level seven known BMD loci on 1p36 (ZBTB40), 6q25 (ESR1), 8q24 (TNFRSF11B), 11q13.4 (LRP5), 12q13 (SP7), 13q14 (TNFSF11) and 18q21 (TNFRSF11A). The many SNPs associated with BMD map to genes in signaling pathways with relevance to bone metabolism and highlight the complex genetic architecture that underlies osteoporosis and variation in BMD.	 16160744 16294278 16362461 16475872 16678095 16412713 16862161 16908916 16869982 16939403 17002572 17012270 17142326 17228994 17227869 17372189 17384015 17572673 17701901 17786239 17943122 17955331 18349089 18284942 18398418 18348202 18391951 18391952 18443579 18455228 18458111 18334548 18445777 18852200 19079262 19189221 19373277 19396169 19500772 19540201 11081517 11315092 11585339 11702786 11731797 12050122 12421822 12543979 12727138 12761501 14751578 15054401 474565 1833235 8481590 8992884 9106663 9373575 10393964 15523071 14025561 15561602 15866165 15990875 16060722
19812673	A genome-wide linkage and association scan reveals novel loci for autism.	Although autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, attempts to identify specific susceptibility genes have thus far met with limited success. Genome-wide association studies using half a million or more markers, particularly those with very large sample sizes achieved through meta-analysis, have shown great success in mapping genes for other complex genetic traits. Consequently, we initiated a linkage and association mapping study using half a million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families (1,553 affected offspring). We identified regions of suggestive and significant linkage on chromosomes 6q27 and 20p13, respectively. Initial analysis did not yield genome-wide significant associations; however, genotyping of top hits in additional families revealed an SNP on chromosome 5p15 (between SEMA5A and TAS2R1) that was significantly associated with autism (P = 2 x 10(-7)). We also demonstrated that expression of SEMA5A is reduced in brains from autistic patients, further implicating SEMA5A as an autism susceptibility gene. The linkage regions reported here provide targets for rare variation screening whereas the discovery of a single novel association demonstrates the action of common variants.	 18179894 18179893 18252227 18184952 18414403 18317468 18485420 18568023 18776908 18776909 19404256 10789276 10866211 11055457 11452364 11731797 11846609 12192642 12587097 12865760 2793783 1574562 7814313 7581446 15716906 16252236 16261168 17028446 17053076 17055247 16971481 17322880 17270452 17084999 17450055 17554300 17701901 17696172 18179895
19820698	Genome-wide association study identifies variants in TMPRSS6 associated with hemoglobin levels.	We carried out a genome-wide association study of hemoglobin levels in 16,001 individuals of European and Indian Asian ancestry. The most closely associated SNP (rs855791) results in nonsynonymous (V736A) change in the serine protease domain of TMPRSS6 and a blood hemoglobin concentration 0.13 (95% CI 0.09-0.17) g/dl lower per copy of allele A (P = 1.6 x 10(-13)). Our findings suggest that TMPRSS6, a regulator of hepcidin synthesis and iron handling, is crucial in hemoglobin level maintenance.	 18408718 10791394 12614226 15514116 16862161 17981570 18245381 18348202 18451267 18523150 19084217 19215730 19247286 19254567
19820697	A genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 22 loci associated with eight hematological parameters in the HaemGen consortium.	The number and volume of cells in the blood affect a wide range of disorders including cancer and cardiovascular, metabolic, infectious and immune conditions. We consider here the genetic variation in eight clinically relevant hematological parameters, including hemoglobin levels, red and white blood cell counts and platelet counts and volume. We describe common variants within 22 genetic loci reproducibly associated with these hematological parameters in 13,943 samples from six European population-based studies, including 6 associated with red blood cell parameters, 15 associated with platelet parameters and 1 associated with total white blood cell count. We further identified a long-range haplotype at 12q24 associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in 9,479 cases and 10,527 controls. We show that this haplotype demonstrates extensive disease pleiotropy, as it contains known risk loci for type 1 diabetes, hypertension and celiac disease and has been spread by a selective sweep specific to European and geographically nearby populations.	 19430483 10542412 10607722 10723803 10880498 11301191 11704759 12070287 12397357 12717436 14709350 15315760 175452 1683417 1615807 9600484 15596565 15676284 15951301 16022956 15935453 16494531 17143282 17059412 17382885 17046049 17554300 17554260 17611496 17729390 17934487 17917702 18311140 18456388 18760392 18922615 18976966 19110211 19091723 19198608 19198610 19221038
19838193	Genome-wide association study in a Chinese Han population identifies nine new susceptibility loci for systemic lupus erythematosus.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population by genotyping 1,047 cases and 1,205 controls using Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChips and replicating 78 SNPs in two additional cohorts (3,152 cases and 7,050 controls). We identified nine new susceptibility loci (ETS1, IKZF1, RASGRP3, SLC15A4, TNIP1, 7q11.23, 10q11.22, 11q23.3 and 16p11.2; 1.77 x 10(-25) < or = P(combined) < or = 2.77 x 10(-8)) and confirmed seven previously reported loci (BLK, IRF5, STAT4, TNFAIP3, TNFSF4, 6q21 and 22q11.21; 5.17 x 10(-42) < or = P(combined) < or = 5.18 x 10(-12)). Comparison with previous GWAS findings highlighted the genetic heterogeneity of SLE susceptibility between Chinese Han and European populations. This study not only advances our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE but also highlights the value of performing GWAS in diverse ancestral populations.	 9324032 19225526 18204098 19337289 16761508 18726402 16862161 9751739 19493061 19169254 19169255 11007952 17136562 19165918 16652219 19570976 17701901 18204447 18204446 17153840 18237382 16301621 18059267 17357110 18204448 15231749 7923373 7979581
19853236	Sequence variants in three loci influence monocyte counts and erythrocyte volume.	Blood cells participate in vital physiological processes, and their numbers are tightly regulated so that homeostasis is maintained. Disruption of key regulatory mechanisms underlies many blood-related Mendelian diseases but also contributes to more common disorders, including atherosclerosis. We searched for quantitative trait loci (QTL) for hematology traits through a whole-genome association study, because these could provide new insights into both hemopoeitic and disease mechanisms. We tested 1.8 million variants for association with 13 hematology traits measured in 6015 individuals from the Australian and Dutch populations. These traits included hemoglobin composition, platelet counts, and red blood cell and white blood cell indices. We identified three regions of strong association that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported in the literature. The first was located in an intergenic region of chromosome 9q31 near LPAR1, explaining 1.5% of the variation in monocyte counts (best SNP rs7023923, p=8.9x10(-14)). The second locus was located on chromosome 6p21 and associated with mean cell erythrocyte volume (rs12661667, p=1.2x10(-9), 0.7% variance explained) in a region that spanned five genes, including CCND3, a member of the D-cyclin gene family that is involved in hematopoietic stem cell expansion. The third region was also associated with erythrocyte volume and was located in an intergenic region on chromosome 6q24 (rs592423, p=5.3x10(-9), 0.6% variance explained). All three loci replicated in an independent panel of 1543 individuals (p values=0.001, 9.9x10(-5), and 7x10(-5), respectively). The identification of these QTL provides new opportunities for furthering our understanding of the mechanisms regulating hemopoietic cell fate.	 10723803 2990035 8791274 10414413 15486340 15823751 17404248 17592125 17701901 17924335 17712044 18025128 18197199 19096518 19019849 19185814 19268276 19307522 19065144 19369660 19132917 19820699 19651813 15315760

19874204	IL21R and PTH may underlie variation of femoral neck bone mineral density as revealed by a genome-wide association study.	Bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the femoral neck (FN) is the most important risk phenotype for osteoporosis and has been used as a reference standard for describing osteoporosis. The specific genes influencing FN BMD remain largely unknown. To identify such genes, we first performed a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis for FN BMD in a discovery sample consisting of 983 unrelated white subjects. We then tested the top significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 175 SNPs with p < 5 x 10(-4)) for replication in a family-based sample of 2557 white subjects. Combing results from these two samples, we found that two genes, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and interleukin 21 receptor (IL21R), achieved consistent association results in both the discovery and replication samples. The PTH gene SNPs, rs9630182, rs2036417, and rs7125774, achieved p values of 1.10 x 10(-4), 3.24 x 10(-4), and 3.06 x 10(-4), respectively, in the discovery sample; p values of 6.50 x 10(-4), 5.08 x 10(-3), and 5.68 x 10(-3), respectively, in the replication sample; and combined p values of 3.98 x 10(-7), 9.52 x 10(-6), and 1.05 x 10(-5), respectively, in the total sample. The IL21R gene SNPs, rs8057551, rs8061992, and rs7199138, achieved p values of 1.51 x 10(-4), 1.53 x 10(-4), and 3.88 x 10(-4), respectively, in the discovery sample; p values of 2.36 x 10(-3), 6.74 x 10(-3), and 6.41 x 10(-3), respectively, in the replication sample; and combined p values of 2.31 x 10(-6), 8.62 x 10(-6), and 1.41 x 10(-5), respectively, in the total sample. The effect size of each SNP was approximately 0.11 SD estimated in the discovery sample. PTH and IL21R both have potential biologic functions important to bone metabolism. Overall, our findings provide some new clues to the understanding of the genetic architecture of osteoporosis.	 10550447 19419293 11346808 11754470 11918225 11984699 12049882 12454799 14593172 15146416 15454942 3371266 2850465 1532281 1615761 7628403 8992884 9240722 10449436 15523071 15297300 15790807 15940371 16291644 16267090 16475872 16862161 16908916 17522711 17509926 17572673 17323110 17547536 17903296 17903291 18180210 18349089 18280230 18433299 18455228 18445777 18325910 18768484 19079262 19207020 19249006 10624457
19896111	Common variants in the trichohyalin gene are associated with straight hair in Europeans.	Hair morphology is highly differentiated between populations and among people of European ancestry. Whereas hair morphology in East Asian populations has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the genetics of this trait in Europeans. We performed a genome-wide association scan for hair morphology (straight, wavy, curly) in three Australian samples of European descent. All three samples showed evidence of association implicating the Trichohyalin gene (TCHH), which is expressed in the developing inner root sheath of the hair follicle, and explaining approximately 6% of variance (p=1.5x10(-31)). These variants are at their highest frequency in Northern Europeans, paralleling the distribution of the straight-hair EDAR variant in Asian populations.	 12202775 19803779 14580313 14685227 7684041 7685034 8317493 7762559 9383290 10417291 15588487 15879453 16521539 16494531 16778047 17063143 17236130 17847007 17919196 17919197 18252222 18292342 18065779 18498207 19307593 19590514 12824425
19893584	Identification of 15 loci influencing height in a Korean population.	Height is a complex genetic trait that involves multiple genetic loci. Recently, 44 loci associated with height were identified in Caucasian individuals by large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies. To identify genetic variants influencing height in the Korean population, we analyzed GWA data from 8842 Korean individuals and identified 15 genomic regions with one or more sequence variants associated with height (P<1 x 10(-5)). Of these, eight loci were newly identified in Koreans (SUPT3H, EXT1, FREM1, PALM2-AKAP2, NUP37-PMCH, IGF1, KRT20 and ANKRD60). The 15 significant loci account for approximately 1.0% of height variation, with a 3.7-cm difference between individuals with < or =8 height-increasing alleles (5.1%) and > or =19 height-increasing alleles (4.2%). We also examined the associations between height loci and idiopathic short stature (ISS). Five loci (SPAG17, KBTBD8, HHIP, HIST1H1D and ACAN) were significantly associated with ISS (uncorrected P<0.05), indicating that height-associated genes in the adult population are involved in extreme cases of short stature in children. This study validates previous reports of loci associated with human height and identified novel candidate regions involved in human growth and development.	
19915576	Genome-wide association study identifies common variants at four loci as genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease.	To identify susceptibility variants for Parkinson's disease (PD), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and two replication studies in a total of 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls from Japan. We identified a new susceptibility locus on 1q32 (P = 1.52 x 10(-12)) and designated this as PARK16, and we also identified BST1 on 4p15 as a second new risk locus (P = 3.94 x 10(-9)). We also detected strong associations at SNCA on 4q22 (P = 7.35 x 10(-17)) and LRRK2 on 12q12 (P = 2.72 x 10(-8)), both of which are implicated in autosomal dominant forms of parkinsonism. By comparing results of a GWAS performed on individuals of European ancestry, we identified PARK16, SNCA and LRRK2 as shared risk loci for PD and BST1 and MAPT as loci showing population differences. Our results identify two new PD susceptibility loci, show involvement of autosomal dominant parkinsonism loci in typical PD and suggest that population differences contribute to genetic heterogeneity in PD.	 18985386 16269443 17873877 11264460 16255080 15786467 15680457 15792962 16254973 18367447 15455394 12029063 9197268 12666095 14593171 16415888 11298763 17911161 16500997 11866528 16252231 10805703 15297300 9284931 17558391 19001166 9010393 16269541 9641683 11500374 17052657 3969206 15201350 15525722 16980962 17554300 17701901 17884683 16543934 15541309 15541308
20183929	A genome-wide association identified the common genetic variants  influence disease severity in beta0-thalassemia/hemoglobin E.	b-Thalassemia/HbE disease is clinically variable. In searching for genetic factors modifying the disease severity, patients were selected based on their disease severities, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed. Genotyping was conducted with the Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChips array using DNAs from 618 Thai b0-thalassemia/HbE patients who were classified as 383 severe and 235 mild phenotypes by a validated scoring system. Twenty-three SNPs in three independent genes/regions were identified as being significantly associated with the disease severity. The highest association was observed with SNPs in the b-globin gene cluster (chr.11p15), and rs2071348 of the HBBP1 gene revealed the most significant association [P = 2.96 9 10(-13), odds ratio (OR) = 4.33 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.74-6.84)]. The second was identified in the intergenic region between the HBS1L and MYB genes (chr.6q23), among which rs9376092 was the most significant [P = 2.36 9 10(-10), OR = 3.07 (95% CI, 2.16-4.38)]. The third region was located in the BCL11A gene (chr.2p16.1), and rs766432 showed the most significant association [P = 5.87 9 10-10, OR = 3.06 (95% CI, 2.15-4.37)]. All three loci were replicated in an independent cohort of 174 Indonesian patients. The associations to fetal hemoglobin levels were also observed with SNPs on these three regions. Our data indicate that several genetic loci act in concert to influence HbF levels of beta(0)-thalassemia/HbE patients. This study revealed that all the three reported loci and the alpha-globin gene locus are the best and common predictors of the disease severity in beta-thalassemia.	 11501945 16954542 2757004 16862161 19528534 12921315 18691915 17637845 17712044 19056937 17129232 15921380 10360511 18667698 19095932 17767159 18026953 7686036 17592125 15725095 17894837 10882078 11132233 10022837 18186524 19120354 9602183 16243092 11017952

19966805	The imprinted DLK1-MEG3 gene region on chromosome 14q32.2 alters susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies to map common disease susceptibility loci have been hugely successful, with over 300 reproducibly associated loci reported to date. However, these studies have not yet provided convincing evidence for any susceptibility locus subject to parent-of-origin effects. Using imputation to extend existing GWA datasets, we have obtained robust evidence at rs941576 for paternally inherited risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D; ratio of allelic effects for paternal versus maternal transmissions = 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71-0.79). This marker is in the imprinted region of chromosome 14q32.2, which contains the functional candidate gene DLK1. Our meta-analysis also provided support at genome-wide significance for a T1D locus at chromosome 19p13.2. The highest association was at marker rs2304256 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86; 95%CI = 0.82-0.90) in the TYK2 gene, which has previously been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.	 10668203 19430480 12937418 14614235 15461798 7925474 8985741 9354805 9529360 10364536 15481099 15776395 15959531 17014736 17044736 17182623 17483596 17511519 17554300 17572673 18513163 18532878 18441336 18978792 19079049 19194500 19200528 19442287 19578363 12493244
19961619	A pooling-based genome-wide analysis identifies new potential candidate genes for atopy in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS).	Asthma and atopy are complex phenotypes with shared genetic component. In this study we attempt to identify genes related to these traits performing a two-stage DNA pooling genome-wide analysis in order to reduce costs. First, we assessed all markers in a subset of subjects using DNA pooling, and in a second stage we evaluated the most promising markers at an individual level.	 12029063 19097194 12373263 12471243 12623859 12687646 15075390 8050554 15297300 15857886 11682119 15970283 16197552 16337449 16415888 16395390 17160900 17159887 17554299 17551261 17611496 17786212 17850181 17903307 18276594 18451855 18442398 18846228 18931509 19020537 12120282
20010835	Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies identify multiple loci associated with pulmonary function.	Spirometric measures of lung function are heritable traits that reflect respiratory health and predict morbidity and mortality. We meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies for two clinically important lung-function measures: forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) and its ratio to forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC), an indicator of airflow obstruction. This meta-analysis included 20,890 participants of European ancestry from four CHARGE Consortium studies: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, Cardiovascular Health Study, Framingham Heart Study and Rotterdam Study. We identified eight loci associated with FEV(1)/FVC (HHIP, GPR126, ADAM19, AGER-PPT2, FAM13A, PTCH1, PID1 and HTR4) and one locus associated with FEV(1) (INTS12-GSTCD-NPNT) at or near genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in the CHARGE Consortium dataset. Our findings may offer insights into pulmonary function and pathogenesis of chronic lung disease.	 10767253 18316681 11316667 12070776 15128784 19343178 16862161 18391951 8819439 8082366 15144468 17384015 15189448 20031568 9872837 12110844 12202775 2646917 15817505 7485515 12045153 16381876 17502995 18391950 1833235 18245812 11470831 8202099 11001584 17167788 8814052 10704888 19553648 17300955 16264058 16055882 19342411 17183725 16873768 19700477 10861898 18958166 10988186 19300482 19255780 11793695 1208363 19201711 15754038 16088534 15358727 17662951 17135278 14623906 19057666 16239144 9603122 17701901 17955331 18391952 18348202 18227835 10543288 7908264 17903307 8420405 15879414 5921755 14685227 1669507 18421017 19300500
20018918	Fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia: genome-wide association studies suggest a regulatory region in the 5' olfactory receptor gene cluster.	In a genome-wide association study of 848 blacks with sickle cell anemia, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with fetal hemoglobin concentration. The most significant SNPs in a discovery sample were tested in a replication set of 305 blacks with sickle cell anemia and in subjects with hemoglobin E or beta thalassemia trait from Thailand and Hong Kong. A novel region on chromosome 11 containing olfactory receptor genes OR51B5 and OR51B6 was identified by 6 SNPs (lowest P = 4.7E-08) and validated in the replication set. An additional olfactory receptor gene, OR51B2, was identified by a novel SNP set enrichment analysis. Genome-wide association studies also validated a previously identified SNP (rs766432) in BCL11A, a gene known to affect fetal hemoglobin levels (P = 2.6E-21) and in Thailand and Hong Kong subjects. Elements within the olfactory receptor gene cluster might play a regulatory role in gamma-globin gene expression.	 17767159 17701901 17299377 17924550 17918249 18245381 18282510 18266208 18187665 18667698 18500726 18691915 19056937 19074263 19153051 19475730 19528534 20029952 20353593 17712044 10607722 11121057 11997516 12504019 12861010 14517543 15163369 7114401 2579336 4063531 2441778 2473969 1379090 8383794 7531513 8995271 9028341 9074425 9331366 9461381 9480762 9742116 9809066 10512676 13800165 15297300 15946310 16861354 16862161 16645164 17158930

20041166	Common genetic variation and the control of HIV-1 in humans.	To extend the understanding of host genetic determinants of HIV-1 control, we performed a genome-wide association study in a cohort of 2,554 infected Caucasian subjects. The study was powered to detect common genetic variants explaining down to 1.3% of the variability in viral load at set point. We provide overwhelming confirmation of three associations previously reported in a genome-wide study and show further independent effects of both common and rare variants in the Major Histocompatibility Complex region (MHC). We also examined the polymorphisms reported in previous candidate gene studies and fail to support a role for any variant outside of the MHC or the chemokine receptor cluster on chromosome 3. In addition, we evaluated functional variants, copy-number polymorphisms, epistatic interactions, and biological pathways. This study thus represents a comprehensive assessment of common human genetic variation in HIV-1 control in Caucasians.	 16362079 16084708 16862161 16998491 17041633 17565686 16199517 17641165 17804494 18301071 18256235 18398418 18684101 18776908 18982067 18758442 19050382 19107206 19115949 19141767 19192942 19276793 19812560 19935381 19693088 17966091 11386265 12525683 14499246 15167933 7965637 8756719 8751444 8791590 9252328 9500580 9836644 16079846 16845089
20081858	New genetic loci implicated in fasting glucose homeostasis and their impact on type 2 diabetes risk.	Levels of circulating glucose are tightly regulated. To identify new loci influencing glycemic traits, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide association studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin and indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose and HOMA-B and two loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. These include nine loci newly associated with fasting glucose (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and C2CD4B) and one influencing fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB-TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes. Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify type 2 diabetes risk loci, as well as loci containing gene variants that are associated with a modest elevation in glucose levels but are not associated with overt diabetes.	 19060908 19060909 19060910 19060911 19079261 10333939 10428031 15527968 15523558 15561905 15761237 15911620 16207847 16488887 19264985 19465231 19734900 19643913 20081857 17982457 18008060 18348202 18451265 18462017 18504548 18539916 18521185 18556336 18762020 18793168 18776908 18784090 10700186 11230178 11259455 11315092 11337480 11600885 12111919 12351489 12882937 14500813 14578255 1262429 2825225 1898674 8945471 9354798 9354799 9742976 16670158 16715098 16912992 17186458 17200703 17187055 17384015 17463246 17572673 17676998 2832445 17873877 18678614 18985159 18952314 19043545 19060906 19060907
20081856	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies a risk locus for major mood disorders on 3p21.1.	The major mood disorders, which include bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD), are considered heritable traits, although previous genetic association studies have had limited success in robustly identifying risk loci. We performed a meta-analysis of five case-control cohorts for major mood disorder, including over 13,600 individuals genotyped on high-density SNP arrays. We identified SNPs at 3p21.1 associated with major mood disorders (rs2251219, P = 3.63 x 10(-8); odds ratio = 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92), with supportive evidence for association observed in two out of three independent replication cohorts. These results provide an example of a shared genetic susceptibility locus for bipolar disorder and MDD.	 11315092 19107115 11328886 12464630 12499305 15123501 15837804 17554300 17701901 17982457 17486107 18197199 18300295 18451988 18317468 19018930 18922999 19002139 19215730 19222302 19065143 19084573 19416921 19488044 19571811
20096396	Association of JAG1 with bone mineral density and osteoporotic fractures: a genome-wide association study and follow-up replication studies.	Bone mineral density (BMD), a diagnostic parameter for osteoporosis and a clinical predictor of fracture, is a polygenic trait with high heritability. To identify genetic variants that influence BMD in different ethnic groups, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 800 unrelated Southern Chinese women with extreme BMD and carried out follow-up replication studies in six independent study populations of European descent and Asian populations including 18,098 subjects. In the meta-analysis, rs2273061 of the Jagged1 (JAG1) gene was associated with high BMD (p = 5.27 x 10(-8) for lumbar spine [LS] and p = 4.15 x 10(-5) for femoral neck [FN], n = 18,898). This SNP was further found to be associated with the low risk of osteoporotic fracture (p = 0.009, OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.57-0.93, n = 1881). Region-wide and haplotype analysis showed that the strongest association evidence was from the linkage disequilibrium block 5, which included rs2273061 of the JAG1 gene (p = 8.52 x 10(-9) for LS and 3.47 x 10(-5) at FN). To assess the function of identified variants, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the binding of c-Myc to the "G" but not "A" allele of rs2273061. A mRNA expression study in both human bone-derived cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed association of the high BMD-related allele G of rs2273061 with higher JAG1 expression. Our results identify the JAG1 gene as a candidate for BMD regulation in different ethnic groups, and it is a potential key factor for fracture pathogenesis.	 11315092 10663345 12111667 12499305 12914574 14727013 15026468 15492363 803282 3806290 3446256 1785377 8992884 9039994 9129746 9556140 15523071 15297300 15695512 16475872 16759177 16845089 16862161 16762578 16647886 16908916 16777502 17070091 17228994 17371165 17572673 17634449 17701901 17903296 17872914 17703270 18455228 18445777 18588671 18655182 19079262 19064610 19129174 19249006 19801982 11508783
20101243	A genome-wide association study identifies pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci on chromosomes 13q22.1, 1q32.1 and 5p15.33.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer in 3,851 affected individuals (cases) and 3,934 unaffected controls drawn from 12 prospective cohort studies and 8 case-control studies. Based on a logistic regression model for genotype trend effect that was adjusted for study, age, sex, self-described ancestry and five principal components, we identified eight SNPs that map to three loci on chromosomes 13q22.1, 1q32.1 and 5p15.33. Two correlated SNPs, rs9543325 (P = 3.27 x 10(-11), per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.18-1.35) and rs9564966 (P = 5.86 x 10(-8), per-allele OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30), map to a nongenic region on chromosome 13q22.1. Five SNPs on 1q32.1 map to NR5A2, and the strongest signal was at rs3790844 (P = 2.45 x 10(-10), per-allele OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.84). A single SNP, rs401681 (P = 3.66 x 10(-7), per-allele OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.27), maps to the CLPTM1L-TERT locus on 5p15.33, which is associated with multiple cancers. Our study has identified common susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer that warrant follow-up studies.	 18508634 17487883 18978790 19151717 19147845 19260742 19327580 19264984 19448973 19578363 19578367 19465454 19588488 19648918 19635604 11162647 10944226 19836008 11433524 11751233 15014077 15327767 7605428 9454332 10440377 15814878 17357076 17554300 18978787
20117844	MGAT5 alters the severity of multiple sclerosis.	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a genetically complex immune mediated, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. To date no genetic variants have been unambiguously linked to disease severity. We have conducted a genome wide screen, using Affymetrix Genechip 500K technology, for severity in 1040 MS patients. Two markers within MGAT5, a gene coding for a glycosylation enzyme, were found to be significantly associated with outcome in the screening as well as in an independent population (combined p-values: 2.8 x 10(-6) and 1.5 x 10(-7)).	
20147318	Genetic variants in ABO blood group region, plasma soluble E-selectin levels and risk of type 2 diabetes.	Blood soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) levels have been related to various conditions such as type 2 diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association study among women of European ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study, and identified genome-wide significant associations between a cluster of markers at the ABO locus (9q34) and plasma sE-selectin concentration. The strongest association was with rs651007, which explained approximately 9.71% of the variation in sE-selectin concentrations. SNP rs651007 was also nominally associated with soluble intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) (P = 0.026) and TNF-R2 levels (P = 0.018), independent of sE-selectin. In addition, the genetic-inferred ABO blood group genotypes were associated with sE-selectin concentrations (P = 3.55 x 10(-47)). Moreover, we found that the genetic-inferred blood group B was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.44, 0.27-0.70) of type 2 diabetes compared with blood group O, adjusting for sE-selectin, sICAM-1, TNF-R2 and other covariates. Our findings indicate that the genetic variants at ABO locus affect plasma sE-selectin levels and diabetes risk. The genetic associations with diabetes risk were independent of sE-selectin levels.	 2792588 19729612 1283598 8603025 9065374 9075611 9111133 9181753 9416885 15579056 15602020 15297300 16322530 16443861 16862161 16899659 17055414 17061733 17293876 17460697 17463248 17463249 17389327 17701901 17943122 17898129 18372903 18464913 18356828 18604267 11532189 11583751 12021250 14988254 15113816 117108 3142337 18797129 18776909 19276450 19434204 1520322
20167575	Genome-wide association study identifies polymorphisms in LEPR as determinants of plasma soluble leptin receptor levels.	Plasma soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels were inversely associated with diabetes risk factors, including adiposity and insulin resistance, and highly correlated with the expression levels of leptin receptor, which is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. We conducted a genome-wide association study of sOB-R in 1504 women of European ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study. The initial scan yielded 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with sOB-R levels (P < 5 x 10(-8)); all mapping to the leptin receptor gene (LEPR). Analysis of imputed genotypes on autosomal chromosomes revealed an additional 106 SNPs in and adjacent to this gene that reached genome-wide significance level. Of these 132 SNPs (including two non-synonymous SNPs, rs1137100 and rs1137101), rs2767485, rs1751492 and rs4655555 remained associated with sOB-R levels at the 0.05 level (P = 9.1 x 10(-9), 0.0105 and 0.0267, respectively) after adjustment for other univariately associated SNPs in a forward selection procedure. Significant associations with these SNPs were replicated in an independent sample of young males (n = 875) residing in Cyprus (P < 1 x 10(-4)). These data provide novel evidence revealing the role of polymorphisms in LEPR in modulating plasma levels of sOB-R and may further our understanding of the complex relationships among leptin, leptin receptor and diabetes-related traits.	 10753948 19959759 10782110 10940326 11123508 11230178 11354636 11443193 11564702 11729160 12021250 12075576 12086939 12089355 12105280 12202775 12270921 12651819 12788897 12805397 12925533 15132731 14993225 15161768 15254881 8584938 9102398 9344648 9537324 9796811 15972940 15997246 16330326 16336196 16862161 16899659 17384015 17611496 17701901 17873877 18765700 18776909 19211814
20189936	A genome-wide association study in 19 633 Japanese subjects identified LHX3-QSOX2 and IGF1 as adult height loci.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several loci associated with human height; however, such evidence was mostly reported in Caucasian populations. Since the different distributions of height between populations suggest their different genetic backgrounds, analysis in different populations would be useful. Here, we present the results of a GWAS for adult height in 19 633 Japanese subjects. We found eight significantly associated loci that satisfied the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 x 10(-8)). Of these, the association to the LHX3-QSOX2 locus was entirely novel (rs12338076, P = 2.2 x 10(-8)). We also identified the association to the IGF1 locus (rs17032362, P = 8.1 x 10(-9)). Conditional association analysis in the IGF1 locus with rs17032362 suggested the existence of an additional independent association with height to this locus (rs1457595, P = 1.2 x 10(-5)). We observed large differences in the allele frequencies of rs17032362 and rs1457595 between Japanese (34 and 9%, respectively) and Caucasian (1.7 and 0%, respectively) populations, thereby suggesting weak statistical powers for the IGF1 locus in the previous Caucasian GWASs for height. We extensively compared our results with those of previous reports on the Caucasian and Korean populations. We were able to replicate all four loci previously reported in Koreans (EFEMP1, ZBTB38, HMGA1 and PLAG1, P < 5.0 x 10(-8)) and 15 loci identified in Caucasians (P < 0.001). The combination of the height-associated loci identified in our study and the previous GWASs demonstrated an effect size of 1.26 cm (95% confidence interval: 1.18-1.34) per 1.0 increase of the normalized Z score for height-increasing alleles, explaining 4.6% of the total variance of adult height.	
20195514	Genome-wide association study reveals multiple loci associated with primary tooth development during infancy.	Tooth development is a highly heritable process which relates to other growth and developmental processes, and which interacts with the development of the entire craniofacial complex. Abnormalities of tooth development are common, with tooth agenesis being the most common developmental anomaly in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study of time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year in 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966) and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We identified 5 loci at P<5x10(-8), and 5 with suggestive association (P<5x10(-6)). The loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development (KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, MSRB3). Genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in the development of cancer. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years.	 7626420 10230104 15643670 16283633 16413481 16419128 17529974 17626284 17767157 18037648 18391952 18425127 19060910 19112455 19234473 19215146 19266065 19181680 19330030 19504606 19812666 11144868 11315092 12412017 12787560 12908068 14767552 15042511 15121863 15202015 15211352
20197096	Genome-wide analysis reveals novel genes influencing temporal lobe structure with relevance to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.	In a genome-wide association study of structural brain degeneration, we mapped the 3D profile of temporal lobe volume differences in 742 brain MRI scans of Alzheimer's disease patients, mildly impaired, and healthy elderly subjects. After searching 546,314 genomic markers, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with bilateral temporal lobe volume (P<5 x 10(-7)). One SNP, rs10845840, is located in the GRIN2B gene which encodes the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor NR2B subunit. This protein - involved in learning and memory, and excitotoxic cell death - has age-dependent prevalence in the synapse and is already a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Risk alleles for lower temporal lobe volume at this SNP were significantly over-represented in AD and MCI subjects vs. controls (odds ratio=1.273; P=0.039) and were associated with mini-mental state exam scores (MMSE; t=-2.114; P=0.035) demonstrating a negative effect on global cognitive function. Voxelwise maps of genetic association of this SNP with regional brain volumes, revealed intense temporal lobe effects (FDR correction at q=0.05; critical P=0.0257). This study uses large-scale brain mapping for gene discovery with implications for Alzheimer's disease.	 18302232 7286917 18267953 18675918 18755202 18691658 18982692 18987709 19060910 19124691 19065146 19562831 19634037 19172649 19734902 19734903 20139996 19004525 10545516 11072261 10801388 11545704 11561025 6610841 3017841 3249771 1759558 1621094 1494032 8232972 8091226 9023431 9343467 9547169 9673349 10190820 10485705 15297300 16344560 17053149 17192785 17354720 17413023 17415783 17554300 17701901 17716071 17903297 17923632 17904591 17943122 18332245 18300295 18385116 11906227 12045153 12403981 12574429 12668349 14644147 14708003 18398418
20195266	Genomewide pharmacogenomic study of metabolic side effects to antipsychotic drugs.	Understanding individual differences in the susceptibility to metabolic side effects as a response to antipsychotic therapy is essential to optimize the treatment of schizophrenia. Here, we perform genomewide association studies (GWAS) to search for genetic variation affecting the susceptibility to metabolic side effects. The analysis sample consisted of 738 schizophrenia patients, successfully genotyped for 492K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from the genomic subsample of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness study. Outcomes included 12 indicators of metabolic side effects, quantifying antipsychotic-induced change in weight, blood lipids, glucose and hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure and heart rate. Our criterion for genomewide significance was a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. A total of 21 SNPs satisfied this criterion. The top finding indicated that a SNP in Meis homeobox 2 (MEIS2) mediated the effects of risperidone on hip circumference (q=0.004). The same SNP was also found to mediate risperidone's effect on waist circumference (q=0.055). Genomewide significant finding were also found for SNPs in PRKAR2B, GPR98, FHOD3, RNF144A, ASTN2, SOX5 and ATF7IP2, as well as in several intergenic markers. PRKAR2B and MEIS2 both have previous research indicating metabolic involvement, and PRKAR2B has previously been shown to mediate antipsychotic response. Although our findings require replication and functional validation, this study shows the potential of GWAS to discover genes and pathways that potentially mediate adverse effects of antipsychotic medication.	 18521090 15020448 15031620 15121641 6342767 2851102 8100642 8297214 7539875 7674530 7545770 8757131 8935797 9342379 9383298 9403953 9710595 10462127 15738930 15966898 16172203 16272755 16137860 16515781 16461575 17549063 17701901 18179892 18172198 18193043 18262040 18195134 18332662 18258416 18484806 18347602 18462017 18650507 18548508 18615156 18988837 19060907 19079261 19058842 18930379 10578448 10764806 10976914 11279116 11606593 11834421 12095917 12807801 12883005 12908658 14550627 12902333 14740321 14969487 19142110 18195716 19377085 19156168 19557161 19420056
20212171	C4BPB/C4BPA is a new susceptibility locus for venous thrombosis with unknown protein S-independent mechanism: results from genome-wide association and gene expression analyses followed by case-control studies.	Through its binding with protein S (PS), a key element of the coagulation/fibrinolysis cascade, the C4b-binding protein (C4BP) has been hypothesized to be involved in the susceptibility to venous thrombosis (VT). To identify genetic factors that may influence the plasma levels of the 3 C4BP existing isoforms, alpha(7)beta(1), alpha(6)beta(1), and alpha(7)beta(0), we conducted a genome-wide association study by analyzing 283 437 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) study composed of 352 persons. Three SNPs at the C4BPB/C4BPA locus were found genome-wide significantly associated with alpha(7)beta(0) levels. One of these SNPs was further found to explain approximately 11% of the variability of mRNA C4BPA expression in the Gutenberg Heart Study composed of 1490 persons, with no effect on C4BPB mRNA expression. The allele associated with increased alpha(7)beta(0) plasma levels and increased C4BPA expression was further found associated with increased risk of VT (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24 [1.03-1.53]) in 2 independent case-control studies (MARseille THrombosis Association study [MARTHA] and FActeurs de RIsque et de récidives de la maladie thromboembolique VEineuse [FARIVE]) gathering 1706 cases and 1379 controls. This SNP was not associated with free PS or total PS. In conclusion, we observed strong evidence that the C4BPB/C4BPA locus is a new susceptibility locus for VT through a PS-independent mechanism that remains to be elucidated.	 20502693 19525478 7519078 670886 1534488 8034625 18160668 12671737 12615682 17849042 19155499 6239102 17308338 18945960 19679244 19912223 7561114 15179322 18682851 7561113 17597997 2971673 12871267 16488980 18673009 15297300 6454142 15557412 9545414 14729845 2480119 2943733 11038326 13655060 11087409 15292065 9423247 19552680 12169536 15072852 2952034 19278955 18695379 16840717
20228799	Genome-wide association identifies multiple ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci.	Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with a complex genetic and environmental etiology. In an effort to identify genetic variation underlying ulcerative colitis risk, we present two distinct genome-wide association studies of ulcerative colitis and their joint analysis with a previously published scan, comprising, in aggregate, 2,693 individuals with ulcerative colitis and 6,791 control subjects. Fifty-nine SNPs from 14 independent loci attained an association significance of P < 10(-5). Seven of these loci exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)). After testing an independent cohort of 2,009 cases of ulcerative colitis and 1,580 controls, we identified 13 loci that were significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (P < 5 x 10(-8)), including the immunoglobulin receptor gene FCGR2A, 5p15, 2p16 and ORMDL3 (orosomucoid1-like 3). We confirmed association with 14 previously identified ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci, and an analysis of acknowledged Crohn's disease loci showed that roughly half of the known Crohn's disease associations are shared with ulcerative colitis. These data implicate approximately 30 loci in ulcerative colitis, thereby providing insight into disease pathogenesis.	 19165918 19079170 19122664 19011112 19235914 19458352 19240061 19732864 19915572 19915573 19915574 19187000 18670423 10856300 12093374 17611496 17684544 17701901 18439550 18438405 18438406 18535581 18587394 18758464 18852200 18836448

20303062	A variant in LIN28B is associated with 2D:4D finger-length ratio, a putative retrospective biomarker of prenatal testosterone exposure.	The ratio of the lengths of an individual's second to fourth digit (2D:4D) is commonly used as a noninvasive retrospective biomarker for prenatal androgen exposure. In order to identify the genetic determinants of 2D:4D, we applied a genome-wide association approach to 1507 11-year-old children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in whom 2D:4D ratio had been measured, as well as a sample of 1382 12- to 16-year-olds from the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study. A meta-analysis of the two scans identified a single variant in the LIN28B gene that was strongly associated with 2D:4D (rs314277: p = 4.1 x 10(-8)) and was subsequently independently replicated in an additional 3659 children from the ALSPAC cohort (p = 1.53 x 10(-6)). The minor allele of the rs314277 variant has previously been linked to increased height and delayed age at menarche, but in our study it was associated with increased 2D:4D in the direction opposite to that of previous reports on the correlation between 2D:4D and age at menarche. Our findings call into question the validity of 2D:4D as a simplistic retrospective biomarker for prenatal testosterone exposure.	 10859702 19448623 11263685 11731797 12573297 12888323 15113628 9853845 14943709 16011922 16107566 16006470 16403410 16504142 16611491 16473482 16971064 17160985 17451014 17380373 17701901 18074216 18292307 18391950 18498211 18348172 19181680 19483683 19708418 19896111 19448620 19448621 19448622 11237119

20348956	A sequence variant at 4p16.3 confers susceptibility to urinary bladder cancer.	Previously, we reported germline DNA variants associated with risk of urinary bladder cancer (UBC) in Dutch and Icelandic subjects. Here we expanded the Icelandic sample set and tested the top 20 markers from the combined analysis in several European case-control sample sets, with a total of 4,739 cases and 45,549 controls. The T allele of rs798766 on 4p16.3 was found to associate with UBC (odds ratio = 1.24, P = 9.9 x 10(-12)). rs798766 is located in an intron of TACC3, 70 kb from FGFR3, which often harbors activating somatic mutations in low-grade, noninvasive UBC. Notably, rs798766[T] shows stronger association with low-grade and low-stage UBC than with more aggressive forms of the disease and is associated with higher risk of recurrence in low-grade stage Ta tumors. The frequency of rs798766[T] is higher in Ta tumors that carry an activating mutation in FGFR3 than in Ta tumors with wild-type FGFR3. Our results show a link between germline variants, somatic mutations of FGFR3 and risk of UBC.	 11395371 17668422 11315092 17684133 19843843 19165921 9850170 16278395 18344981 11857419 16877735 15347601 16288035 14517540 3500674 15654335 18385739 19648920 19151717 19722178 13655060 18794855 16352616 10471491 20016592 19054893

20372150	Variants in ADCY5 and near CCNL1 are associated with fetal growth and birth weight.	To identify genetic variants associated with birth weight, we meta-analyzed six genome-wide association (GWA) studies (n = 10,623 Europeans from pregnancy/birth cohorts) and followed up two lead signals in 13 replication studies (n = 27,591). rs900400 near LEKR1 and CCNL1 (P = 2 x 10(-35)) and rs9883204 in ADCY5 (P = 7 x 10(-15)) were robustly associated with birth weight. Correlated SNPs in ADCY5 were recently implicated in regulation of glucose levels and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, providing evidence that the well-described association between lower birth weight and subsequent type 2 diabetes has a genetic component, distinct from the proposed role of programming by maternal nutrition. Using data from both SNPs, we found that the 9% of Europeans carrying four birth weight-lowering alleles were, on average, 113 g (95% CI 89-137 g) lighter at birth than the 24% with zero or one alleles (P(trend) = 7 x 10(-30)). The impact on birth weight is similar to that of a mother smoking 4-5 cigarettes per day in the third trimester of pregnancy.	 12162727 11315092 12958120 15166208 6029463 4069477 3322602 1957592 8436255 9140089 9246691 9609578 10657852 20081858 11739217 9662401 9914249 10051336 10348008 15520301 16260516 16085375 16681382 17311798 17503332 17873877 18216018 18391952 18852200 18952314 19060907 19079261 19228808 19592620 19633095 19961608 12503609

Using genome-wide association, we identify common variants at 2p12-p13, 6q26, 17q23 and 19q13 associated with serum creatinine, a marker of kidney function (P = 10(-10) to 10(-15)). Of these, rs10206899 (near NAT8, 2p12-p13) and rs4805834 (near SLC7A9, 19q13) were also associated with chronic kidney disease (P = 5.0 x 10(-5) and P = 3.6 x 10(-4), respectively). Our findings provide insight into metabolic, solute and drug-transport pathways underlying susceptibility to chronic kidney disease.	 17568785 17289582 18359399 18509326 18794856 19625999 19430482 17940554 10807551 10940244 8853987 16285859 16307453 16760447 16862161
20385819	Genetic variants near TIMP3 and high-density lipoprotein-associated loci influence susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration.	We executed a genome-wide association scan for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 2,157 cases and 1,150 controls. Our results validate AMD susceptibility loci near CFH (P < 10(-75)), ARMS2 (P < 10(-59)), C2/CFB (P < 10(-20)), C3 (P < 10(-9)), and CFI (P < 10(-6)). We compared our top findings with the Tufts/Massachusetts General Hospital genome-wide association study of advanced AMD (821 cases, 1,709 controls) and genotyped 30 promising markers in additional individuals (up to 7,749 cases and 4,625 controls). With these data, we identified a susceptibility locus near TIMP3 (overall P = 1.1 x 10(-11)), a metalloproteinase involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and previously implicated in early-onset maculopathy. In addition, our data revealed strong association signals with alleles at two loci (LIPC, P = 1.3 x 10(-7); CETP, P = 7.4 x 10(-7)) that were previously associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels in blood. Consistent with the hypothesis that HDL metabolism is associated with AMD pathogenesis, we also observed association with AMD of HDL-c-associated alleles near LPL (P = 3.0 x 10(-3)) and ABCA1 (P = 5.6 x 10(-4)). Multilocus analysis including all susceptibility loci showed that 329 of 331 individuals (99%) with the highest-risk genotypes were cases, and 85% of these had advanced AMD. Our studies extend the catalog of AMD associated loci, help identify individuals at high risk of disease, and provide clues about underlying cellular pathways that should eventually lead to new therapies.	 17053108 20385826 17634448 17767156 17884985 17943122 18193043 18208329 18372903 18587394 18685559 19060906 19079261 10783137 11315092 11593451 12040043 14968411 15234127 8460013 7894485 15761120 15761121 15761122 15987700 16080115 16174643 16005869 16518403 16862161 16936732 16936733 19169254 19197355 19405847 17668381
20386566	Genome-wide association study of bipolar I disorder in the Han Chinese population.	We report the first genome-wide association study in 1000 bipolar I patients and 1000 controls, with a replication of the top hits in another 409 cases and 1000 controls in the Han Chinese population. Four regions with most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, of which three were not found in previous GWA studies in the Caucasian populations. Among them, SNPs close to specificity protein 8 (SP8) and ST8 α-N-acetyl- neuraminide α-2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8SIA2) are associated with Bipolar I, with P-values of 4.87 × 10(-7) (rs2709736) and 6.05 × 10(-6) (rs8040009), respectively. We have also identified SNPs in potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 12 gene (KCTD12) (rs2073831, P=9.74 × 10(-6)) and in CACNB2 (Calcium channel, voltage-dependent, β-2 subunit) gene (rs11013860, P=5.15 × 10(-5)), One SNP nearby the rs1938526 SNP of ANK3 gene and another SNP nearby the SNP rs11720452 in chromosome 3 reported in previous GWA studies also showed suggestive association in this study (P=6.55 × 10(-5) and P=1.48 × 10(-5), respectively). This may suggest that there are common and population-specific susceptibility genes for bipolar I disorder.

Prognosis and survival are significant concerns for individuals with heart failure (HF). To better understand the pathophysiology of HF prognosis, the association between 2,366,858 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and all-cause mortality was evaluated among individuals with incident HF from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study.	 20445134 10785506 11157674 12649263 15383406 1208363 2646917 1669507 8520709 8606324 9279807 14819398 15964203 16862161 17384015 17554300 18621691 18854754 19179199 19305408 19305409 19464411 19454037 19336532 19728115 20031568
20418485	Genome-wide association study of circulating vitamin D levels.	The primary circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], is associated with multiple medical outcomes, including rickets, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis and cancer. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4501 persons of European ancestry drawn from five cohorts, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding group-specific component (vitamin D binding) protein, GC, on chromosome 4q12-13 that were associated with 25(OH)D concentrations: rs2282679 (P=2.0x10(-30)), in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs7041, a non-synonymous SNP (D432E; P=4.1x10(-22)) and rs1155563 (P=3.8x10(-25)). Suggestive signals for association with 25(OH)D were also observed for SNPs in or near three other genes involved in vitamin D synthesis or activation: rs3829251 on chromosome 11q13.4 in NADSYN1 [encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetase; P=8.8x10(-7)], which was in high LD with rs1790349, located in DHCR7, the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that synthesizes cholesterol from 7-dehydrocholesterol; rs6599638 in the region harboring the open-reading frame 88 (C10orf88) on chromosome 10q26.13 in the vicinity of ACADSB (acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase), involved in cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis (P=3.3x10(-7)); and rs2060793 on chromosome 11p15.2 in CYP2R1 (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1, encoding a key C-25 hydroxylase that converts vitamin D3 to an active vitamin D receptor ligand; P=1.4x10(-5)). We genotyped SNPs in these four regions in 2221 additional samples and confirmed strong genome-wide significant associations with 25(OH)D through meta-analysis with the GWAS data for GC (P=1.8x10(-49)), NADSYN1/DHCR7 (P=3.4x10(-9)) and CYP2R1 (P=2.9x10(-17)), but not C10orf88 (P=2.4x10(-5)).	 18476984 18689381 19116321 18030310 19255064 19648918 19836008 11045788 11111101 11204437 12015775 12048248 12547821 14696037 15090720 15128933 15342452 3574368 8370586 8205268 9330287 9564171 16103450 16135132 16054167 17529973 17607662 18264096 18263601 18511070 18593774
20729852	A shared susceptibility locus in PLCE1 at 10q23 for gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in ethnic Chinese subjects in which we genotyped 551,152 SNPs. We report a combined analysis of 2,240 gastric cancer cases, 2,115 ESCC cases and 3,302 controls drawn from five studies. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex and study, multiple variants at 10q23 had genome-wide significance for gastric cancer and ESCC independently. A notable signal was rs2274223, a nonsynonymous SNP located in PLCE1, for gastric cancer (P = 8.40 x 10(-9); per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.31) and ESCC (P = 3.85 x 10(-9); OR = 1.34). The association with gastric cancer differed by anatomic subsite. For tumors in the cardia the association was stronger (P = 4.19 x 10(-15); OR = 1.57), and for those in the noncardia stomach it was absent (P = 0.44; OR = 1.05). Our findings at 10q23 could provide insight into the high incidence of both cancers in China.	 11967536 20131315 12672787 12930761 13130116 15054463 15492928 6992989 7167171 8217613 15455378 15604236 15761078 16862161 17086182 17040931 17517688 18488030 18520036 18596976 18852200 19327566 19534025 19458037 19656375 19698717 20562874 12397650
20811658	Genome-wide association for smoking cessation success in a trial of precessation nicotine replacement.	Abilities to successfully quit smoking display substantial evidence for heritability in classic and molecular genetic studies. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have demonstrated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes that distinguish successful quitters from individuals who were unable to quit smoking in clinical trial participants and in community samples. Many of the subjects in these clinical trial samples were aided by nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We now report novel GWA results from participants in a clinical trial that sought dose/response relationships for "precessation" NRT. In this trial, 369 European-American smokers were randomized to 21 or 42 mg NRT, initiated 2 wks before target quit dates. Ten-week continuous smoking abstinence was assessed on the basis of self-reports and carbon monoxide levels. SNP genotyping used Affymetrix 6.0 arrays. GWA results for smoking cessation success provided no P value that reached "genome-wide" significance. Compared with chance, these results do identify (a) more clustering of nominally positive results within small genomic regions, (b) more overlap between these genomic regions and those identified in six prior successful smoking cessation GWA studies and (c) sets of genes that fall into gene ontology categories that appear to be biologically relevant. The 1,000 SNPs with the strongest associations form a plausible Bayesian network; no such network is formed by randomly selected sets of SNPs. The data provide independent support, based on individual genotyping, for many loci previously nominated on the basis of data from genotyping in pooled DNA samples. These results provide further support for the idea that aid for smoking cessation may be personalized on the basis of genetic predictors of outcome.	 17099884 16611469 17407593 17701901 17483139 18316681 18385739 18385676 18519826 18991966 18790807 19009022 19064790 19261943 19238150 19593411 19184766 19761364 19851339 20235792 20418888 20418889 20418890 20379614 10788733 15500307 2161310 9875838 17158188
20818381	A genome-wide association study in the Japanese population identifies susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes at UBE2E2 and C2CD4A-C2CD4B.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 459,359 SNPs in a Japanese population with a three-stage study design (stage 1, 4,470 cases and 3,071 controls; stage 2, 2,886 cases and 3,087 controls; stage 3, 3,622 cases and 2,356 controls). We identified new associations in UBE2E2 on chromosome 3 and in C2CD4A-C2CD4B on chromosome 15 at genome-wide significant levels (rs7612463 in UBE2E2, combined P = 2.27 × 10⁻⁹; rs7172432 in C2CD4A-C2CD4B, combined P = 3.66 × 10⁻⁹). The association of these two loci with T2D was replicated in other east Asian populations. In the European populations, the C2CD4A-C2CD4B locus was significantly associated with T2D, and a combined analysis of all populations gave P = 8.78 × 10⁻¹⁴, whereas the UBE2E2 locus did not show association to T2D. In conclusion, we identified two new loci at UBE2E2 and C2CD4A-C2CD4B associated with susceptibility to T2D.	 15789306 19470990 11501945 17463246 16862161 19060908 17463249 17245589 16644676 16415884 19060907 17460697 18711367 15705591 16543239 8666377 9371400 18817904 15662000 17463248 18711366 17928989 19734900 15052270 17293876 18477659 15527968 18372903 18348202 18162508 20081857 18812463 19060909 20081858 18008060 3899825
20849430	The TCF7L2 diabetes risk variant is associated with HbA₁(C) levels: a genome-wide association meta-analysis.	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified around 20 common genetic variants influencing the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Likewise, a number of variants have been associated with diabetes-related quantitative glycaemic traits, but to date the overlap between these genes and variants has been low. The majority of genetic studies have focused on fasting plasma glucose levels; however, this measure is highly variable. We have conducted a GWA meta-analysis of glycated haemoglobin (HbA₁(C) ) levels within three healthy nondiabetic populations. This phenotype provides an estimate of mean glucose levels over 2-3 months and is a more stable predictor of future diabetes risk. Participants were from three isolated populations: the Orkney Isles in the north of Scotland, the Dalmatian islands of Vis, and Korčula in Croatia (total of 1782 nondiabetic subjects). Association was tested in each population and results combined by meta-analysis. The strongest association was with the TCF7L2 gene (rs7903146, P= 1.48 × 10⁻⁷). This is also the strongest common genetic risk factor for T2D but it has not been identified in previous genome-wide studies of glycated haemoglobin.	
20852633	Common variants at 19p13 are associated with susceptibility to ovarian cancer.	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy in the developed world, accounting for 4% of the deaths from cancer in women. We performed a three-phase genome-wide association study of EOC survival in 8,951 individuals with EOC (cases) with available survival time data and a parallel association analysis of EOC susceptibility. Two SNPs at 19p13.11, rs8170 and rs2363956, showed evidence of association with survival (overall P = 5 × 10⁻⁴ and P = 6 × 10⁻⁴, respectively), but they did not replicate in phase 3. However, the same two SNPs demonstrated genome-wide significance for risk of serous EOC (P = 3 × 10⁻⁹ and P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹, respectively). Expression analysis of candidate genes at this locus in ovarian tumors supported a role for the BRCA1-interacting gene C19orf62, also known as MERIT40, which contains rs8170, in EOC development.	 11973645 19261749 19401693 19648919 15073127 20852631 19261748 19261746 19058220 18252211 17618284 17572673 17554300 16532393 16211264 16047333 15247347 15077121 20003265 10807385
20858683	Common variants at 10 genomic loci influence hemoglobin A₁(C) levels via glycemic and nonglycemic pathways.	Glycated hemoglobin (HbA₁(c)), used to monitor and diagnose diabetes, is influenced by average glycemia over a 2- to 3-month period. Genetic factors affecting expression, turnover, and abnormal glycation of hemoglobin could also be associated with increased levels of HbA₁(c). We aimed to identify such genetic factors and investigate the extent to which they influence diabetes classification based on HbA₁(c) levels.	 11315092 11673367 20581827 11872688 7082831 6848140 6640948 2569052 7655856 9490597 15695325 16934002 17186458 17786212 18008060 17569110 18316026 18451265 18521185 18678614 18694998 19096518 19060907 19060908 19060909 19323962 19196895 19502545 19820697 19862010 19651813 20081857 20081858

20885792	Dementia revealed: novel chromosome 6 locus for late-onset Alzheimer disease provides genetic evidence for folate-pathway abnormalities.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) have consistently observed strong evidence of association with polymorphisms in APOE. However, until recently, variants at few other loci with statistically significant associations have replicated across studies. The present study combines data on 483,399 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previously reported GWAS of 492 LOAD cases and 496 controls and from an independent set of 439 LOAD cases and 608 controls to strengthen power to identify novel genetic association signals. Associations exceeding the experiment-wide significance threshold (alpha=1.03x10(-7)) were replicated in an additional 1,338 cases and 2,003 controls. As expected, these analyses unequivocally confirmed APOE's risk effect (rs2075650, P=1.9x10(-36)). Additionally, the SNP rs11754661 at 151.2 Mb of chromosome 6q25.1 in the gene MTHFD1L (which encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like protein) was significantly associated with LOAD (P=4.70x10(-8); Bonferroni-corrected P=0.022). Subsequent genotyping of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.8) with rs11754661 identified statistically significant associations in multiple SNPs (rs803424, P=0.016; rs2073067, P=0.03; rs2072064, P=0.035), reducing the likelihood of association due to genotyping error. In the replication case-control set, we observed an association of rs11754661 in the same direction as the previous association at P=0.002 (P=1.90x10(-10) in combined analysis of discovery and replication sets), with associations of similar statistical significance at several adjacent SNPs (rs17349743, P=0.005; rs803422, P=0.004). In summary, we observed and replicated a novel statistically significant association in MTHFD1L, a gene involved in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway. This finding is noteworthy, as MTHFD1L may play a role in the generation of methionine from homocysteine and influence homocysteine-related pathways and as levels of homocysteine are a significant risk factor for LOAD development.	 9060980 19136949 17317784 16862161 12925369 7574468 10835412 8446617 12714109 17101828 12011287 7596406 8094895 12389706 19948730 18509313 10827107 11524377 12490454 17474819 18976728 12559659 12849121 1734291 12016588 17572673 12424737 18988837 12490529 1671712 19118814 19734902 8550266 20523261 19734903 12591216 19924716 9740112 9052711 17554300 17634449 20098691 20460622 20070850 17701901 17998437 18648646 15642489 18823527 8346443 15596614 7651536 18479766 6610841 17553421 16526030 11197372 8350998 7638622
20876614	A genome-wide association study reveals susceptibility variants for non-small cell lung cancer in the Korean population.	Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and the major cause of cancer death, both in Korea and worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as the predominant histologic type. To identify genetic risk factors, we here conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a replication study in 1425 patients with NSCLC and 3011 controls from Korea. From the data for 2162 participants analyzed using the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP array 5.0K, 168 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for validation. In the second stage, we were able to genotype 168 SNPs in 804 patients and 1470 controls to confirm the results of the GWAS. In the meta-analysis, rs2131877 at the chromosome 3q29 region was the most significant biomarker of lung cancer susceptibility in Koreans (P = 2.43 × 10(-8)). Four markers that were located within the chromosome 3q29 region were also associated with lung cancer susceptibility (trend P < 1.2 × 10(-4)), along with markers on 5p15 that were previously reported in populations of European descent. This high-density large-scale GWAS carried out in the Korean population suggests that 3q29 is a novel susceptibility region associated with lung cancer susceptibility in Koreans.

The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) is a potential source for high throughput phenotyping to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including those of medically relevant quantitative traits. We describe use of the Mayo Clinic EMR to conduct a GWAS of red blood cell (RBC) traits in a cohort of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and controls without PAD.	 17701901 17211848 18667698 18976966 19084217 19207024 19820697 19820698 19820699 19862006 19862010 20190054 20819866 10962014 12103252 12149247 15056661 6352482 8125629 8653873 15699438 16604073 16862161 16574494 17288707 18408718
20877300	Genome-wide association study of increasing suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment in the GENDEP project.	Suicidal thoughts during antidepressant treatment have been the focus of several candidate gene association studies. The aim of the present genome-wide association study was to identify additional genetic variants involved in increasing suicidal ideation during escitalopram and nortriptyline treatment. A total of 706 adult participants of European ancestry, treated for major depression with escitalopram or nortriptyline over 12 weeks in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study were genotyped with Illumina Human 610-Quad Beadchips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 244 subjects experienced an increase in suicidal ideation during follow-up. The genetic marker most significantly associated with increasing suicidality (8.28 × 10(-7)) was a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs11143230) located 30 kb downstream of a gene encoding guanine deaminase (GDA) on chromosome 9q21.13. Two suggestive drug-specific associations within KCNIP4 (Kv channel-interacting protein 4; chromosome 4p15.31) and near ELP3 (elongation protein 3 homolog; chromosome 8p21.1) were found in subjects treated with escitalopram. Suggestive drug by gene interactions for two SNPs near structural variants on chromosome 4q12, one SNP in the apolipoprotein O (APOO) gene on chromosome Xp22.11 and one on chromosome 11q24.3 were found. The most significant association within a set of 33 candidate genes was in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) gene. Finally, we also found trend for an association within genes previously associated with psychiatric phenotypes indirectly linked to suicidal behavior, that is, GRIP1, NXPH1 and ANK3. The results suggest novel pathways involved in increasing suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment and should help to target treatment to reduce the risk of this dramatic adverse event. Limited power precludes definitive conclusions and replication in larger sample is warranted.	
20881960	Hundreds of variants clustered in genomic loci and biological pathways affect human height.	Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.	 18952825 19343178 19369660 19474294 19557189 19571811 19570815 19812666 20126254 20562874 20562875 20714348 11055368 11119293 11315092 12598898 13679528 9716527 16041375 16565746 17120245 17701901 17767157 17943122 18193045 18391950 18391951 18391952
20921969	Genome-wide association study of antipsychotic-induced QTc interval prolongation.	QT prolongation is associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Identifying the genetic variants that mediate antipsychotic-induced prolongation may help to minimize this risk, which might prevent the removal of efficacious drugs from the market. We performed candidate gene analysis and five drug-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 492K single-nucleotide polymorphisms to search for genetic variation mediating antipsychotic-induced QT prolongation in 738 schizophrenia patients from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness study. Our candidate gene study suggests the involvement of NOS1AP and NUBPL (P-values=1.45 × 10(-05) and 2.66 × 10(-13), respectively). Furthermore, our top GWAS hit achieving genome-wide significance, defined as a Q-value <0.10 (P-value=1.54 × 10(-7), Q-value=0.07), located in SLC22A23, mediated the effects of quetiapine on prolongation. SLC22A23 belongs to a family of organic ion transporters that shuttle a variety of compounds, including drugs, environmental toxins and endogenous metabolites, across the cell membrane. This gene is expressed in the heart and is integral in mouse heart development. The genes mediating antipsychotic-induced QT prolongation partially overlap with the genes affecting normal QT interval variation. However, some genes may also be unique for drug-induced prolongation. This study demonstrates the potential of GWAS to discover genes and pathways that mediate antipsychotic-induced QT prolongation.	 12883891 17714910 8100642 7545770 16172203 16648850 19305408 18246200 18337493 18347602 18511491 19305409 19420056 18521091 19875103 19721433 12908658 11315092 11691681 11701642 11728238 11735845 12534433 12704598 12861106 12883005 14550627 18930379 16862161 17576865 17565224 17701901 14760488

20923822	Radiation pharmacogenomics: a genome-wide association approach to identify radiation response biomarkers using human lymphoblastoid cell lines.	Radiation therapy is used to treat half of all cancer patients. Response to radiation therapy varies widely among patients. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify biomarkers to help predict radiation response using 277 ethnically defined human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Basal gene expression levels and 1.3 million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from both Affymetrix and Illumina platforms were assayed for all 277 human LCLs. MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assays for radiation cytotoxicity were also performed to obtain area under the curve (AUC) as a radiation response phenotype for use in the association studies. Functional validation of candidate genes, selected from an integrated analysis that used SNP, expression, and AUC data, was performed with multiple cancer cell lines using specific siRNA knockdown, followed by MTS and colony-forming assays. A total of 27 loci, each containing at least two SNPs within 50 kb with P-values less than 10(-4) were associated with radiation AUC. A total of 270 expression probe sets were associated with radiation AUC with P < 10(-3). The integrated analysis identified 50 SNPs in 14 of the 27 loci that were associated with both AUC and the expression of 39 genes, which were also associated with radiation AUC (P < 10(-3)). Functional validation using siRNA knockdown in multiple tumor cell lines showed that C13orf34, MAD2L1, PLK4, TPD52, and DEPDC1B each significantly altered radiation sensitivity in at least two cancer cell lines. Studies performed with LCLs can help to identify novel biomarkers that might contribute to variation in response to radiation therapy and enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying that variation.	 10918393 20005454 11935316 12502868 12692264 12829159 12883005 15172988 15374940 15359380 3802101 2262383 8985028 10380890 15297300 15789306 15824734 16140933 16177019 15986428 16862161 16929324 16969982 17186465 16517066 17314271 17407386 17487680 18199535 18356109 18378770 18566290 18568480 18572087 18757419 18615013 18765826 18710659 18959755 19043577 19069018 19148183 19089452 19224581 19272842 19349959 19487276 19022265 19638463 19562735 19680542 19706858 19644074 19683821 19818353 19898621 11516845
20887962	Adiponectin concentrations: a genome-wide association study.	Adiponectin is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. To date, there has been no genome-wide association study (GWAS) of adiponectin levels in Asians. Here we present a GWAS of a cohort of Korean volunteers. A total of 4,001 subjects were genotyped by using a genome-wide marker panel in a two-stage design (979 subjects initially and 3,022 in a second stage). Another 2,304 subjects were used for follow-up replication studies with selected markers. In the discovery phase, the top SNP associated with mean log adiponectin was rs3865188 in CDH13 on chromosome 16 (p = 1.69 × 10(-15) in the initial sample, p = 6.58 × 10(-39) in the second genome-wide sample, and p = 2.12 × 10(-32) in the replication sample). The meta-analysis p value for rs3865188 in all 6,305 individuals was 2.82 × 10(-83). The association of rs3865188 with high-molecular-weight adiponectin (p = 7.36 × 10(-58)) was even stronger in the third sample. A reporter assay that evaluated the effects of a CDH13 promoter SNP in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs3865188 revealed that the major allele increased expression 2.2-fold. This study clearly shows that genetic variants in CDH13 influence adiponectin levels in Korean adults.	 10845877 20067957 11479627 12611609 12878598 14752031 15210937 9877251 15509809 16380500 17391153 17786212 18316604 18502270 19088327 19165155 19396169 20011104 20018283 11234459
20932310	Genome-wide association reveals genetic effects on human Aβ42 and τ protein levels in cerebrospinal fluids: a case control study.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common and highly heritable with many genes and gene variants associated with AD in one or more studies, including APOE ε2/ε3/ε4. However, the genetic backgrounds for normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in terms of changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P, have not been clearly delineated. We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better define the genetic backgrounds to these three states in relation to CSF levels.	 16461860 14615052 16862161 16882736 16847012 17192785 17420311 16725228 17317784 17474819 17434289 17517621 17553421 17194218 17701901 17586559 17873874 17873877 17934472 17721864 17998437 18416843 18971308 19222302 19296504 19539887 19622817 19668339 19086053 19734902 19734903 20107219 20485568 20029386 12614904 17220890 15094846 15146195 15179935 2218531 9226371 15745979 15823670 16009131 16033913 16443497 17135279 16488378
20935630	Association analyses of 249,796 individuals reveal 18 new loci associated with body mass index.	Obesity is globally prevalent and highly heritable, but its underlying genetic factors remain largely elusive. To identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and ∼ 2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸), one of which includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation.	 17982457 18160634 18344981 17658951 18372903 18454148 18298429 19057666 19060906 19079260 19079261 19136992 19151714 18840502 19251046 19369661 19557161 19557197 19506107 19571811 19715440 20081857 20081858 19966786 20089729 20233392 20346437 20421936 11684524 12068290 12588803 12646665 14557433 3712713 9019399 9519560 9813653 9916804 16252236 16936203 17130481 17235396 17434869 17384015 17572673 17519222 17701901 17356525 17565041 17873877 20562874 20714348
20935629	Meta-analysis identifies 13 new loci associated with waist-hip ratio and reveals sexual dimorphism in the genetic basis of fat distribution.	Waist-hip ratio (WHR) is a measure of body fat distribution and a predictor of metabolic consequences independent of overall adiposity. WHR is heritable, but few genetic variants influencing this trait have been identified. We conducted a meta-analysis of 32 genome-wide association studies for WHR adjusted for body mass index (comprising up to 77,167 participants), following up 16 loci in an additional 29 studies (comprising up to 113,636 subjects). We identified 13 new loci in or near RSPO3, VEGFA, TBX15-WARS2, NFE2L3, GRB14, DNM3-PIGC, ITPR2-SSPN, LY86, HOXC13, ADAMTS9, ZNRF3-KREMEN1, NISCH-STAB1 and CPEB4 (P = 1.9 × 10⁻⁹ to P = 1.8 × 10⁻⁴⁰) and the known signal at LYPLAL1. Seven of these loci exhibited marked sexual dimorphism, all with a stronger effect on WHR in women than men (P for sex difference = 1.9 × 10⁻³ to P = 1.2 × 10⁻¹³). These findings provide evidence for multiple loci that modulate body fat distribution independent of overall adiposity and reveal strong gene-by-sex interactions.	 18830075 12716671 18713823 19005195 19060906 19060911 19079260 19079261 19557161 19557189 19789630 19924209 20031564 20081857 20081858 19966786 20130649 19812545 20360734 20581827 20935630 17434869 17389330 17694296 17875489 17873877 18839131 18327256 12952881 14747216 14749734 15028826 14737183 15298351 2228394 9098178 9845227 15755822 15953938 16617105 16722806 17210927 17346703 18344981 18282107 18372903 18454148 18462017 17956727

We carried out a meta-analysis of two recent psoriasis genome-wide association studies with a combined discovery sample of 1,831 affected individuals (cases) and 2,546 controls. One hundred and two loci selected based on P value rankings were followed up in a three-stage replication study including 4,064 cases and 4,685 controls from Michigan, Toronto, Newfoundland and Germany.

20953186	Common variants at TRAF3IP2 are associated with susceptibility to psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.	Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory joint disease that is distinct from other chronic arthritides and which is frequently accompanied by psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) and seronegativity for rheumatoid factor. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 609 German individuals with PsA (cases) and 990 controls with replication in 6 European cohorts including a total of 5,488 individuals. We replicated PsA associations at HLA-C and IL12B and identified a new association at TRAF3IP2 (rs13190932, P = 8.56 × 10⁻¹⁷). TRAF3IP2 was also associated with PsV in a German cohort including 2,040 individuals (rs13190932, P = 1.95 × 10⁻³). Sequencing of the exons of TRAF3IP2 identified a coding variant (p.Asp10Asn, rs33980500) as the most significantly associated SNP (P = 1.13 × 10⁻²⁰, odds ratio = 1.95). Functional assays showed reduced binding of this TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6, suggesting altered modulation of immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a new and shared pathway for PsA and PsV.	 10748240 20858257 12459498 8304761 16623771 16862161 16871531 17236132 17277779 17304231 17701901 17982455 18369459 17728335 18613831 18794853 18794857 19035472 18800148 19169253 19169254 19680446 19790120 19741010 19525279 19439430 11315092
20953188	Genome-wide association study identifies a psoriasis susceptibility locus at TRAF3IP2.	Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and chronic inflammation, the most common form of which is psoriasis vulgaris (PsV). We present a genome-wide association analysis of 2,339,118 SNPs in 472 PsV cases and 1,146 controls from Germany, with follow-up of the 147 most significant SNPs in 2,746 PsV cases and 4,140 controls from three independent replication panels. We identified an association at TRAF3IP2 on 6q21 and genotyped two SNPs at this locus in two additional replication panels (the combined discovery and replication panels consisted of 6,487 cases and 8,037 controls; combined P = 2.36 × 10⁻¹⁰ for rs13210247 and combined P = 1.24 × 10⁻¹⁶ for rs33980500). About 15% of psoriasis cases develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA). A stratified analysis of our datasets including only PsA cases (1,922 cases compared to 8,037 controls, P = 4.57 × 10⁻¹² for rs33980500) suggested that TRAF3IP2 represents a shared susceptibility for PsV and PsA. TRAF3IP2 encodes a protein involved in IL-17 signaling and which interacts with members of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family.	 19554025 19715440 19609315 20428186 11125122 12140561 12413772 12644634 12894126 15485634 4581554 8304761 9735374 10075662 15688070 16032514 16198775 16490960 16871531 17236132 17277779 17304231 17658397 17587057 17701901 17554368 17943122 18075513 18369459 18200064 18219280 18802076 19169253 19169254 19895991
20953190	A genome-wide association study identifies new psoriasis susceptibility loci and an interaction between HLA-C and ERAP1.	To identify new susceptibility loci for psoriasis, we undertook a genome-wide association study of 594,224 SNPs in 2,622 individuals with psoriasis and 5,667 controls. We identified associations at eight previously unreported genomic loci. Seven loci harbored genes with recognized immune functions (IL28RA, REL, IFIH1, ERAP1, TRAF3IP2, NFKBIA and TYK2). These associations were replicated in 9,079 European samples (six loci with a combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ and two loci with a combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁷). We also report compelling evidence for an interaction between the HLA-C and ERAP1 loci (combined P = 6.95 × 10⁻⁶). ERAP1 plays an important role in MHC class I peptide processing. ERAP1 variants only influenced psoriasis susceptibility in individuals carrying the HLA-C risk allele. Our findings implicate pathways that integrate epidermal barrier dysfunction with innate and adaptive immune dysregulation in psoriasis pathogenesis.	 19966805 19915572 11254454 11315092 12069564 12148091 12436110 12483210 8248665 9634500 15793588 16642438 16998491 17236132 17277779 17554300 17507495 17952073 18059266 18179884 18267068 18305139 18305142 18364390 19169253 19169254 19169255 19264985 19380721 19543373 19503088 19548248 19641206 19917699 20061127
20966902	Genome-wide association study of anthropometric traits and evidence of interactions with age and study year in Filipino women.	Increased values of multiple adiposity-related anthropometric traits are important risk factors for many common complex diseases. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study for four quantitative traits related to body size and adiposity (BMI, weight, waist circumference, and height) in a cohort of 1,792 adult Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). This is the first GWA study of anthropometric traits in Filipinos, a population experiencing a rapid transition into a more obesogenic environment. In addition to identifying suggestive evidence of additional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association signals (P < 10(-5)), we replicated (P < 0.05, same direction of additive effect) associations previously reported in European populations of both BMI and weight with MC4R and FTO, of BMI with BDNF, and of height with EFEMP1, ZBTB38, and NPPC, but none with waist circumference. We also replicated loci reported in Japanese or Korean populations as associated with BMI (OTOL1) and height (HIST1H1PS2, C14orf145, GPC5). A difference in local linkage disequilibrium (LD) between European and Asian populations suggests a narrowed association region for BDNF, while still including a proposed functional nonsynonymous amino acid substitution variant (rs6265, Val66Met). Finally, we observed significant evidence (P < 0.0042) for age-by-genotype interactions influencing BMI for rs17782313 (MC4R) and rs9939609 (FTO), and for a study year-by-genotype interaction for rs4923461 (BDNF). Our results show that several genetic risk factors are associated with anthropometric traits in Filipinos and provide further insight into the effects of BDNF, FTO, and MC4R on BMI.	 10611369 19343178 11579207 19396169 19410676 19448982 19557161 19557197 19270305 19570815 19729412 19880856 20154341 20189936 21058334 20507864 12096056 15340117 16255080 16614226 16862161 17186019 17142813 17196724 17444961 17434869 17194218 18193045 18391950 18391951 18391952 18454146 18454148 18426866 18667348 18952825 19079260 19079261 18711367 18711366 19151714 10716929

20972438	A multi-stage genome-wide association study of bladder cancer identifies multiple susceptibility loci.	We conducted a multi-stage, genome-wide association study of bladder cancer with a primary scan of 591,637 SNPs in 3,532 affected individuals (cases) and 5,120 controls of European descent from five studies followed by a replication strategy, which included 8,382 cases and 48,275 controls from 16 studies. In a combined analysis, we identified three new regions associated with bladder cancer on chromosomes 22q13.1, 19q12 and 2q37.1: rs1014971, (P = 8 × 10⁻¹²) maps to a non-genic region of chromosome 22q13.1, rs8102137 (P = 2 × 10⁻¹¹) on 19q12 maps to CCNE1 and rs11892031 (P = 1 × 10⁻⁷) maps to the UGT1A cluster on 2q37.1. We confirmed four previously identified genome-wide associations on chromosomes 3q28, 4p16.3, 8q24.21 and 8q24.3, validated previous candidate associations for the GSTM1 deletion (P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹) and a tag SNP for NAT2 acetylation status (P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹), and found interactions with smoking in both regions. Our findings on common variants associated with bladder cancer risk should provide new insights into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis.	 10980118 15789306 17684133 17194218 18598372 16862161 20101243 10835412 15342541 17510073 17529967 9230212 17943122 19578367 16737809 18596976 17060358 18491077 19880377 11149414 19147845 16550165 19578363 20062064 16112301 17392301 18852200 17401363 11902577 12566741 20348956 19767753 8320745 19648920 15052270 17460043 9765507 19151717 19767755 11156391 17554300 4008097 17618283 18794855 20739907 18372905 510245 20562874 19836008 18441336 18239083
20972440	Meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies identifies susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer at 1q41, 3q26.2, 12q13.13 and 20q13.33.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ten loci harboring common variants that influence risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). To enhance the power to identify additional CRC risk loci, we conducted a meta-analysis of three GWAS from the UK which included a total of 3,334 affected individuals (cases) and 4,628 controls followed by multiple validation analyses including a total of 18,095 cases and 20,197 controls. We identified associations at four new CRC risk loci: 1q41 (rs6691170, odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, P = 9.55 × 10⁻¹⁰ and rs6687758, OR = 1.09, P = 2.27 × 10⁻⁹, 3q26.2 (rs10936599, OR = 0.93, P = 3.39 × 10⁻⁸), 12q13.13 (rs11169552, OR = 0.92, P = 1.89 × 10⁻¹⁰ and rs7136702, OR = 1.06, P = 4.02 × 10⁻⁸) and 20q13.33 (rs4925386, OR = 0.93, P = 1.89 × 10⁻¹⁰). In addition to identifying new CRC risk loci, this analysis provides evidence that additional CRC-associated variants of similar effect size remain to be discovered.	 17873877 12111919 17618282 12351577 8944229 19920828 19011631 17618283 17618284 8205277 11693338 15531920 8401579 16423598
21060860	Common genetic variants and modification of penetrance of BRCA2-associated breast cancer.	The considerable uncertainty regarding cancer risks associated with inherited mutations of BRCA2 is due to unknown factors. To investigate whether common genetic variants modify penetrance for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we undertook a two-staged genome-wide association study in BRCA2 mutation carriers. In stage 1 using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform, 592,163 filtered SNPs genotyped were available on 899 young (<40 years) affected and 804 unaffected carriers of European ancestry. Associations were evaluated using a survival-based score test adjusted for familial correlations and stratified by country of the study and BRCA2*6174delT mutation status. The genomic inflation factor (λ) was 1.011. The stage 1 association analysis revealed multiple variants associated with breast cancer risk: 3 SNPs had p-values<10(-5) and 39 SNPs had p-values<10(-4). These variants included several previously associated with sporadic breast cancer risk and two novel loci on chromosome 20 (rs311499) and chromosome 10 (rs16917302). The chromosome 10 locus was in ZNF365, which contains another variant that has recently been associated with breast cancer in an independent study of unselected cases. In stage 2, the top 85 loci from stage 1 were genotyped in 1,264 cases and 1,222 controls. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for stage 1 and 2 were combined and estimated using a retrospective likelihood approach, stratified by country of residence and the most common mutation, BRCA2*6174delT. The combined per allele HR of the minor allele for the novel loci rs16917302 was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.86, ) and for rs311499 was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.85, ). FGFR2 rs2981575 had the strongest association with breast cancer risk (per allele HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39, ). These results indicate that SNPs that modify BRCA2 penetrance identified by an agnostic approach thus far are limited to variants that also modify risk of sporadic BRCA2 wild-type breast cancer.	 17999359 16418514 18182601 18251999 18355772 18349832 18776909 18971310 19690183 19656774 19214744 19843326 20484397 20453838 20400477 20418484 20714348 20585100 20652397 18060068 8898735 15880399 15473905 16206141 16537453 17148764 17357068 17466083 17384015 17625127 17701901 11443730 11857015 12677558 12900793 14519755 3061869 8571953 8673092
21060863	Four novel Loci (19q13, 6q24, 12q24, and 5q14) influence the microcirculation in vivo.	There is increasing evidence that the microcirculation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Changes in retinal vascular caliber reflect early microvascular disease and predict incident cardiovascular events. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with retinal vascular caliber. We analyzed data from four population-based discovery cohorts with 15,358 unrelated Caucasian individuals, who are members of the Cohort for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and replicated findings in four independent Caucasian cohorts (n  =  6,652). All participants had retinal photography and retinal arteriolar and venular caliber measured from computer software. In the discovery cohorts, 179 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) spread across five loci were significantly associated (p<5.0×10(-8)) with retinal venular caliber, but none showed association with arteriolar caliber. Collectively, these five loci explain 1.0%-3.2% of the variation in retinal venular caliber. Four out of these five loci were confirmed in independent replication samples. In the combined analyses, the top SNPs at each locus were: rs2287921 (19q13; p  =  1.61×10(-25), within the RASIP1 locus), rs225717 (6q24; p = 1.25×10(-16), adjacent to the VTA1 and NMBR loci), rs10774625 (12q24; p  =  2.15×10(-13), in the region of ATXN2,SH2B3 and PTPN11 loci), and rs17421627 (5q14; p = 7.32×10(-16), adjacent to the MEF2C locus). In two independent samples, locus 12q24 was also associated with coronary heart disease and hypertension. Our population-based genome-wide association study demonstrates four novel loci associated with retinal venular caliber, an endophenotype of the microcirculation associated with clinical cardiovascular disease. These data provide further insights into the contribution and biological mechanisms of microcirculatory changes that underlie cardiovascular disease.	 19430483 10599656 10853001 11146696 12020333 12123638 14562179 14970147 15223786 2646917 1669507 7637142 9363696 9747450 15564546 15528253 15831463 16317022 16462853 16505201 16505202 16723443 17041135 17314342 17351290 17554300 17562993 17591866 17540447 18194651 18200594 18070990 18332097 18760764 19073967 19272373 19755365 19728115 19803772 19812666 19820697 19862010 19884126 20031568 20581827 19430479
21082022	Genome-wide association study of blood pressure extremes identifies variant near UMOD associated with hypertension.	Hypertension is a heritable and major contributor to the global burden of disease. The sum of rare and common genetic variants robustly identified so far explain only 1%-2% of the population variation in BP and hypertension. This suggests the existence of more undiscovered common variants. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,621 hypertensive cases and 1,699 controls and follow-up validation analyses in 19,845 cases and 16,541 controls using an extreme case-control design. We identified a locus on chromosome 16 in the 5' region of Uromodulin (UMOD; rs13333226, combined P value of 3.6 × 10⁻¹¹). The minor G allele is associated with a lower risk of hypertension (OR [95%CI]: 0.87 [0.84-0.91]), reduced urinary uromodulin excretion, better renal function; and each copy of the G allele is associated with a 7.7% reduction in risk of CVD events after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status (H.R. = 0.923, 95% CI 0.860-0.991; p = 0.027). In a subset of 13,446 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements, we show that rs13333226 is independently associated with hypertension (unadjusted for eGFR: 0.89 [0.83-0.96], p = 0.004; after eGFR adjustment: 0.89 [0.83-0.96], p = 0.003). In clinical functional studies, we also consistently show the minor G allele is associated with lower urinary uromodulin excretion. The exclusive expression of uromodulin in the thick portion of the ascending limb of Henle suggests a putative role of this variant in hypertension through an effect on sodium homeostasis. The newly discovered UMOD locus for hypertension has the potential to give new insights into the role of uromodulin in BP regulation and to identify novel drugable targets for reducing cardiovascular risk.	 19936945 19629048 19430482 19430483 10972367 11315092 12423980 12471200 12493255 12748199 12826435 14570709 2283315 1798004 8429286 9350657 9647496 9783495 10075613 10452295 15652604 15809377 16152135 16862161 16883323 16970175 16982955 17554300 17572673 17762635 18219299 18354102 18398418 18391953 18650405 18852389 19020324 19262228 19237679 19296547 19430479
20981099	Fine-scale recombination rate differences between sexes, populations and individuals.	Meiotic recombinations contribute to genetic diversity by yielding new combinations of alleles. Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination events. The use of these maps has been demonstrated by the identification of recombination hotspots and associated motifs, and the discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots. However, these maps provide no information about individual or sex differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like natural selection can bias LD-based estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these shortcomings, but their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to construct the first recombination maps based on directly observed recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about 15% of hotspots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel associations between recombination characteristics of individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) reveal population differences previously masked by noise and map differences at regions previously described as targets of natural selection.	 11315092 19165921 18239089 19956727 19411596 15105499 9718341 16255080 19165926 18617692 15654335 20044541 12053178 20044539 20016592 20044538 16224025
21037115	Genome-wide association analysis of body mass in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Cachexia, whether assessed by body mass index (BMI) or fat-free mass index (FFMI), affects a significant proportion of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is an independent risk factor for increased mortality, increased emphysema, and more severe airflow obstruction. The variable development of cachexia among patients with COPD suggests a role for genetic susceptibility. The objective of the present study was to determine genetic susceptibility loci involved in the development of low BMI and FFMI in subjects with COPD. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BMI was conducted in three independent cohorts of European descent with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage II or higher COPD: Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-Points (ECLIPSE; n = 1,734); Norway-Bergen cohort (n = 851); and a subset of subjects from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT; n = 365). A genome-wide association of FFMI was conducted in two of the cohorts (ECLIPSE and Norway). In the combined analyses, a significant association was found between rs8050136, located in the first intron of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, and BMI (P = 4.97 × 10(-7)) and FFMI (P = 1.19 × 10(-7)). We replicated the association in a fourth, independent cohort consisting of 502 subjects with COPD from COPDGene (P = 6 × 10(-3)). Within the largest contributing cohort of our analysis, lung function, as assessed by forced expiratory volume at 1 second, varied significantly by FTO genotype. Our analysis suggests a potential role for the FTO locus in the determination of anthropomorphic measures associated with COPD.	 18310396 20173748 18335027 18216052 10588597 10593802 11998990 12759479 14999112 9620907 16002800 16002569 16280439 16368793 16600946 16412624 17434869 17496892 17446335 17505043 17701901 17575095 17991826 18159244 18058156 17996046 18218107 18239580 18256137 18218688 17658951 18348202 18487448 18647953 18775698 18787525 18852156 19214238 18829675 19300482 19234441 19266501 19322589 19559399 19542184 17342162
21037568	A genome-wide association study of Hodgkin's lymphoma identifies new susceptibility loci at 2p16.1 (REL), 8q24.21 and 10p14 (GATA3).	To identify susceptibility loci for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), we conducted a genome-wide association study of 589 individuals with cHL (cases) and 5,199 controls with validation in four independent samples totaling 2,057 cases and 3,416 controls. We identified three new susceptibility loci at 2p16.1 (rs1432295, REL, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, combined P = 1.91 × 10(-8)), 8q24.21 (rs2019960, PVT1, OR = 1.33, combined P = 1.26 × 10(-13)) and 10p14 (rs501764, GATA3, OR = 1.25, combined P = 7.05 × 10(-8)). Furthermore, we confirmed the role of the major histocompatibility complex in disease etiology by revealing a strong human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association (rs6903608, OR = 1.70, combined P = 2.84 × 10(-50)). These data provide new insight into the pathogenesis of cHL.	 18794855 19017178 19078975 19151747 19264782 19380639 19539572 19507254 19561604 19561607 19684604 19667275 20062064 20308568 19958356 10556199 10866292 11830502 11929801 12029063 12111919 12478664 12511414 12734687 12837833 12949811 14600123 15112271 15163636 3992076 3785181 3468804 2402486 2216459 8289784 8116619 7923125 7824015 10340377 15632006 15687363 15994882 16224025 16228001 16381825 16413481 16155052 16682969 16362079 16862161 17099321 17148480 17289997 17332371 17394394 17401363 17401366 17554300 17529967 17618284 17641686 17630352 17895893 18039120 18194563

21044949	ELF1 is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Asian populations.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic involvement. The susceptibility genes identified so far can only explain a small proportion of disease heritability. Through a genome-wide association in a Hong Kong Chinese cohort and subsequent replication in two other Asian populations, with a total of 3164 patients and 4482 matched controls, we identified association of ELF1 (E74-like factor 1) with SLE (rs7329174, OR = 1.26, joint P= 1.47 × 10(-8)). ELF1 belongs to the ETS family of transcription factors and is known to be involved in T cell development and function. Database analysis revealed transcripts making use of three alternative exon1s for this gene. Near equivalent expression levels of distinct transcripts initiated from alternative exon1s were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from both SLE patients and healthy controls. Although a direct association of rs7329174 with the three forms of transcripts for this gene was not detected, these findings support an important role of ELF1 in SLE susceptibility and suggest a potentially tight regulation for the expression of this gene.	
21044948	Dissection of the genetics of Parkinson's disease identifies an additional association 5' of SNCA and multiple associated haplotypes at 17q21.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1705 Parkinson's disease (PD) UK patients and 5175 UK controls, the largest sample size so far for a PD GWAS. Replication was attempted in an additional cohort of 1039 French PD cases and 1984 controls for the 27 regions showing the strongest evidence of association (P< 10(-4)). We replicated published associations in the 4q22/SNCA and 17q21/MAPT chromosome regions (P< 10(-10)) and found evidence for an additional independent association in 4q22/SNCA. A detailed analysis of the haplotype structure at 17q21 showed that there are three separate risk groups within this region. We found weak but consistent evidence of association for common variants located in three previously published associated regions (4p15/BST1, 4p16/GAK and 1q32/PARK16). We found no support for the previously reported SNP association in 12q12/LRRK2. We also found an association of the two SNPs in 4q22/SNCA with the age of onset of the disease.	 15680457 15654335 1564476 15464261 15115761 14593171 19543373 19165922 17846035 19879020 20070850 20360734 20116045 19434077 19915576 19915575 18162161 17701901 17572673 17554300 17251522 17174556 16862161 15792962 15888485 15786467
21184583	Genome-wide association study of theta band event-related oscillations identifies serotonin receptor gene HTR7 influencing risk of alcohol dependence.	Event-related brain oscillations (EROs) represent highly heritable neuroelectrical correlates of human perception and cognitive performance that exhibit marked deficits in patients with various psychiatric disorders. We report the results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an ERO endophenotype-frontal theta ERO evoked by visual oddball targets during P300 response in 1,064 unrelated individuals drawn from a study of alcohol dependence. Forty-two SNPs of the Illumina HumanHap 1 M microarray were selected from the theta ERO GWAS for replication in family-based samples (N = 1,095), with four markers revealing nominally significant association. The most significant marker from the two-stage study is rs4907240 located within ARID protein 5A gene (ARID5A) on chromosome 2q11 (unadjusted, Fisher's combined P = 3.68 × 10⁻⁶). However, the most intriguing association to emerge is with rs7916403 in serotonin receptor gene HTR7 on chromosome 10q23 (combined P = 1.53 × 10⁻⁴), implicating the serotonergic system in the neurophysiological underpinnings of theta EROs. Moreover, promising SNPs were tested for association with diagnoses of alcohol dependence (DSM-IV), revealing a significant relationship with the HTR7 polymorphism among GWAS case-controls (P = 0.008). Significant recessive genetic effects were also detected for alcohol dependence in both case-control and family-based samples (P = 0.031 and 0.042, respectively), with the HTR7 risk allele corresponding to theta ERO reductions among homozygotes. These results suggest a role of the serotonergic system in the biological basis of alcohol dependence and underscore the utility of analyzing brain oscillations as a powerful approach to understanding complex genetic psychiatric disorders.	 7511503 11959810 7511509 11315092 10821328 11163897 12763572 16862161 3435047 19243449 12812993 16244653 19339359 16887227 11163901 11888546 16150631 10788704 9298538 15559250 17573239 12529502 16192982 17053093 10923994 15749980 15229186 7927323 20201924 8644716 8189735 17942244 7530638 9502512 16938560 8446632 12029063 9080442 15798190 17567401 10729789 17129626 10025584 7529682 12404302 8439239 15640446 9857961 16961766 5009428 9886685 9579105 18618593 11489606 15297300 12237305 15826840 18789922 14756825 19412439 18634760 14654097 3061869 17118959 9545414 9603606 9634505 10486334 15078565 18930185 9450602 18243350 10909856 18252944 19812666 15813707 16823639 10402506 11809976 9009808 10924369 18476671 9464642 17701901 14965246 15024690 16491125 16926113 9084407 12606066 9832198 11027791 11018485 16540194 15583116 9756048 11163900 10554581 7908055 10474063 15210286 16019097 10677641 10813798 10615721 16451707
21042317	Genome-wide association study of major depressive disorder: new results, meta-analysis, and lessons learned.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common complex disorder with a partly genetic etiology. We conducted a genome-wide association study of the MDD2000+ sample (2431 cases, 3673 screened controls and >1 M imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)). No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance either in the MDD2000+ study, or in meta-analysis with two other studies totaling 5763 cases and 6901 controls. These results imply that common variants of intermediate or large effect do not have main effects in the genetic architecture of MDD. Suggestive but notable results were (a) gene-based tests suggesting roles for adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3, 2p23.3) and galanin (GAL, 11q13.3); published functional evidence relates both of these to MDD and serotonergic signaling; (b) support for the bipolar disorder risk variant SNP rs1006737 in CACNA1C (P=0.020, odds ratio=1.10); and (c) lack of support for rs2251219, a SNP identified in a meta-analysis of affective disorder studies (P=0.51). We estimate that sample sizes 1.8- to 2.4-fold greater are needed for association studies of MDD compared with those for schizophrenia to detect variants that explain the same proportion of total variance in liability. Larger study cohorts characterized for genetic and environmental risk factors accumulated prospectively are likely to be needed to dissect more fully the etiology of MDD.	 19837050 20038947 15939837 20081856 16095566 19474294 15123491 18197199 9928182 19339359 11463151 20360314 19065144 16648327 8629888 10189053 8189735 20029411 18711365 12798255 8300980 19996033 19107115 19200528 9928183 1417436 20598278 16721402 20516156 16863269 19942622 19521722 17903109 19531786 678037 18498207 19812666 17924348 17135278 16219115 17573119 17701901 18317468 19221909 17267777 19621016 11007705 18548508 17938638 10359473 9766772 19918758
21048783	A genome-wide association study identifies RNF213 as the first Moyamoya disease gene.	Moyamoya disease (MMD) shows progressive cerebral angiopathy characterized by bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis and abnormal collateral vessels. Although ∼ 15% of MMD cases are familial, the MMD gene(s) remain unknown. A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region. A single haplotype consisting of seven SNPs at the RNF213 locus was tightly associated with MMD (P = 5.3 × 10(-10)). RNF213 encodes a really interesting new gene finger protein with an AAA ATPase domain and is abundantly expressed in spleen and leukocytes. An RNA in situ hybridization analysis of mouse tissues indicated that mature lymphocytes express higher levels of Rnf213 mRNA than their immature counterparts. Mutational analysis of RNF213 revealed a founder mutation, p.R4859K, in 95% of MMD families, 73% of non-familial MMD cases and 1.4% of controls; this mutation greatly increases the risk of MMD (P = 1.2 × 10(-43), odds ratio = 190.8, 95% confidence interval = 71.7-507.9). Three additional missense mutations were identified in the p.R4859K-negative patients. These results indicate that RNF213 is the first identified susceptibility gene for MMD.	
21057379	Case-case genome-wide association analysis shows markers differentially associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and implicates calcium channel genes.	There are theoretical reasons why comparing marker allele frequencies between cases of different diseases, rather than with controls, may offer benefits. The samples may be better matched, especially for background risk factors common to both diseases. Genetic loci may also be detected which influence which of the two diseases occurs if common risk factors are present.	 18668038 18317464 19048012 19693800 18268501 19065143 18711365 17490491 15793701 19586533 19215628 18317468 19571811
21051598	The major genetic determinants of HIV-1 control affect HLA class I peptide presentation.	Infectious and inflammatory diseases have repeatedly shown strong genetic associations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); however, the basis for these associations remains elusive. To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified >300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles. These results implicate the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection.	 18275276 18179884 18838392 19143809 19935663 20010788 20220841 20205591 20811451 18982067 10694578 11309482 12525683 15264254 8195600 8597949 8791590 9252328 9836644 10073943 10513667 15592417 16081817 16361312 16368108 16982909 16998491 17641165 17892849 17873874
21668797	A genome-wide association study of DSM-IV cannabis dependence.	Despite twin studies showing that 50-70% of variation in DSM-IV cannabis dependence is attributable to heritable influences, little is known of specific genotypes that influence vulnerability to cannabis dependence. We conducted a genome-wide association study of DSM-IV cannabis dependence. Association analyses of 708 DSM-IV cannabis-dependent cases with 2346 cannabis-exposed non-dependent controls was conducted using logistic regression in PLINK. None of the 948 142 single nucleotide polymorphisms met genome-wide significance (P at E-8). The lowest P values were obtained for polymorphisms on chromosome 17 (rs1019238 and rs1431318, P values at E-7) in the ANKFN1 gene. While replication is required, this study represents an important first step toward clarifying the biological underpinnings of cannabis dependence.	 15126440 8189735 16696624 16862161 17176038 17701901 20091798 19335651 19413562 19576999 19906700 20202923 19127564

21051773	PCSK6 is associated with handedness in individuals with dyslexia.	Approximately 90% of humans are right-handed. Handedness is a heritable trait, yet the genetic basis is not well understood. Here we report a genome-wide association study for a quantitative measure of relative hand skill in individuals with dyslexia [reading disability (RD)]. The most highly associated marker, rs11855415 (P = 4.7 × 10(-7)), is located within PCSK6. Two independent cohorts with RD show the same trend, with the minor allele conferring greater relative right-hand skill. Meta-analysis of all three RD samples is genome-wide significant (n = 744, P = 2.0 × 10(-8)). Conversely, in the general population (n = 2666), we observe a trend towards reduced laterality of hand skill for the minor allele (P = 0.0020). These results provide molecular evidence that cerebral asymmetry and dyslexia are linked. Furthermore, PCSK6 is a protease that cleaves the left-right axis determining protein NODAL. Functional studies of PCSK6 promise insights into mechanisms underlying cerebral lateralization and dyslexia.	 18538293 1528408 20585627 21085122 15717286 18718938 16966240 15975942 4037763 10809672 5487462 14594743 16385449 12447384 17667961 17999362 17572673 16623936 11743577 20509871 16278297 14684825 19288465 18652545 11237119 17178399 18824185 15382729 24233472 11774074 20634204 15514892 9915953 12596796 12357333 11099452 19064609 11251124 17001339 1741956 19005910 16254601 16273319 11545538 19543373 12954984

It is characterised by changes in joint structure, including degeneration of the articular cartilage, and its aetiology is multifactorial with a strong postulated genetic component.	 11033593 13498604 12111919 12687544 12958120 3741515 7656348 9125257 9382404 17012270 17045816 17974687 18299287 18471798 18198197 18687274 18361430 18406176 19248122 18467514 19181678 19479880 19029166 19054821 19946021 19751691 20112360 11315092
21079520	Genome-wide association study on overall survival of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel.	Our goal was to identify candidate polymorphisms that could influence overall survival (OS) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with carboplatin (CBDCA) and paclitaxel (PTX).	
21076409	Common variants in 22 loci are associated with QRS duration and cardiac ventricular conduction.	The QRS interval, from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the S wave on an electrocardiogram, reflects ventricular depolarization and conduction time and is a risk factor for mortality, sudden death and heart failure. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis in 40,407 individuals of European descent from 14 studies, with further genotyping in 7,170 additional Europeans, and we identified 22 loci associated with QRS duration (P < 5 × 10(-8)). These loci map in or near genes in pathways with established roles in ventricular conduction such as sodium channels, transcription factors and calcium-handling proteins, but also point to previously unidentified biologic processes, such as kinase inhibitors and genes related to tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that SCN10A, a candidate gene at the most significantly associated locus in this study, is expressed in the mouse ventricular conduction system, and treatment with a selective SCN10A blocker prolongs QRS duration. These findings extend our current knowledge of ventricular depolarization and conduction.	 20196758 20190752 20110552 19762328 16214442 16136080 16415376 16585411 16643374 16601229 16828632 17336901 17483457 17924335 17661127 18297366 18378906 20596727 20639392 10642437 10642594 10848585 11251078 11231286 11826271 11846609 11855950 12093772 12149465 12386154 12805376 14966518 15079064 15037560 14975175 15158141 2919564 8699242 9500551 9736743 10377080 10383463 10448219 15345710 15690394 18348202 18436145 18285513 18467625 18852200 18840423 18974171 19131956 19290028 19171938 19305408 19305409 19376574 19376125 19584346 19661464 19586923 19728115 20062060 20062061 20062063 19744495
21079607	A genome-wide association study on common SNPs and rare CNVs in anorexia nervosa.	Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a mental illness with high mortality that most commonly afflicts adolescent female individuals. Clinical symptoms include chronic food refusal, weight loss and body image distortions. We carried out a genome-wide association study on 1033 AN cases and 3733 pediatric control subjects, all of whom were of European ancestry and were genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap610 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We confirmed that common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within OPRD1 (rs533123, P=0.0015) confer risk for AN, and obtained suggestive evidence that common SNPs near HTR1D (rs7532266, P=0.04) confer risk for restricting-type AN specifically. However, no SNPs reached genome-wide significance in our data, whereas top association signals were detected near ZNF804B, CSRP2BP, NTNG1, AKAP6 and CDH9. In parallel, we performed genome-wide analysis on copy number variations (CNVs) using the signal intensity data from the SNP arrays. We did not find evidence that AN cases have more CNVs than control subjects, nor do they have over-representation of rare or large CNVs. However, we identified several regions with rare CNVs that were only observed in AN cases, including a recurrent 13q12 deletion (1.5 Mb) disrupting SCAS in two cases, and CNVs disrupting the CNTN6/CNTN4 region in several AN cases. In conclusion, our study suggests that both common SNPs and rare CNVs may confer genetic risk to AN. These results point to intriguing genes that await further validation in independent cohorts for confirmatory roles in AN.	 12210640 16152574 23974872 8481735 11799475 17497704 23801539 24549058 17384015 21036328 7793446 20054198 23999524 9672050 14566926 16600234 22963884 10703806 23217606 10698815 22911880 21972279 20507892 19828139 14639702 10914105 11867360 16815322 16520436 22797368 20509871 19680270 20935630 21926974 18646037 15609150 20517342 20811451 16134111 7814009 23568457 22472876 22484627 20421936 15852321 20732625 15800149 11912184 17370291 11232922 10698830 17464678 17430085 15800146 16212836 15569892 21167468 11352375 21727255 18951455 22243964 17370290 23001569 2053633 19543373 17469897 22777127 22706312
21084426	Genome-wide association study confirms BST1 and suggests a locus on 12q24 as the risk loci for Parkinson's disease in the European population.	We performed a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify common Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants in the European population. The initial genome-wide scan was conducted in a French sample of 1039 cases and 1984 controls, using almost 500 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two SNPs at SNCA were found to be associated with PD at the genome-wide significance level (P < 3 × 10(-8)). An additional set of promising and new association signals was identified and submitted for immediate replication in two independent case-control studies of subjects of European descent. We first carried out an in silico replication study using GWAS data from the WTCCC2 PD study sample (1705 cases, 5200 WTCCC controls). Nominally replicated SNPs were further genotyped in a third sample of 1527 cases and 1864 controls from France and Australia. We found converging evidence of association with PD on 12q24 (rs4964469, combined P = 2.4 × 10(-7)) and confirmed the association on 4p15/BST1 (rs4698412, combined P = 1.8 × 10(-6)), previously reported in Japanese data. The 12q24 locus includes RFX4, an isoform of which, named RFX4_v3, encodes brain-specific transcription factors that regulate many genes involved in brain morphogenesis and intracellular calcium homeostasis.	
21088011	Genome-wide association study identifies a new locus for coronary artery disease on chromosome 10p11.23.	Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified 10 chromosomal loci for coronary artery disease (CAD) or myocardial infarction (MI). However, these loci explain only a small proportion of the genetic variability of these pertinent diseases. We sought to identify additional CAD/MI loci by applying a three-stage approach.	
21124955	Genome-wide association study identifies two novel regions at 11p15.5-p13 and 1p31 with major impact on acute-phase serum amyloid A.	Elevated levels of acute-phase serum amyloid A (A-SAA) cause amyloidosis and are a risk factor for atherosclerosis and its clinical complications, type 2 diabetes, as well as various malignancies. To investigate the genetic basis of A-SAA levels, we conducted the first genome-wide association study on baseline A-SAA concentrations in three population-based studies (KORA, TwinsUK, Sorbs) and one prospective case cohort study (LURIC), including a total of 4,212 participants of European descent, and identified two novel genetic susceptibility regions at 11p15.5-p13 and 1p31. The region at 11p15.5-p13 (rs4150642; p = 3.20×10(-111)) contains serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) and the adjacent general transcription factor 2 H1 (GTF2H1), Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 5 (HPS5), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC). This region explains 10.84% of the total variation of A-SAA levels in our data, which makes up 18.37% of the total estimated heritability. The second region encloses the leptin receptor (LEPR) gene at 1p31 (rs12753193; p = 1.22×10(-11)) and has been found to be associated with CRP and fibrinogen in previous studies. Our findings demonstrate a key role of the 11p15.5-p13 region in the regulation of baseline A-SAA levels and provide confirmative evidence of the importance of the 1p31 region for inflammatory processes and the close interplay between A-SAA, leptin, and other acute-phase proteins.	 9729453 7273846 10036584 10211414 10504381 10524285 15753219 15851593 15993885 16766262 16737350 16580675 17572673 17991875 18299466 18348202 18439548 19060910 18692935 18726069 8188252 8013100 7835903 7622070 8548812 8946909 9102398 9386157 19276158 19758820 20133848 20140694 19567438 10608507 10903648 12107724 12438276 12958120 14633907 14871291 14970107 15170927 15296495 5505398 9738637
21124946	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of cortical bone mineral density unravels allelic heterogeneity at the RANKL locus and potential pleiotropic effects on bone.	Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified SNPs associated with areal bone mineral density (aBMD). However, this measure is influenced by several different skeletal parameters, such as periosteal expansion, cortical bone mineral density (BMD(C)) cortical thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness, which may be under distinct biological and genetic control. We have carried out a GWA and replication study of BMD(C), as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), a more homogenous and valid measure of actual volumetric bone density. After initial GWA meta-analysis of two cohorts (ALSPAC n = 999, aged ∼15 years and GOOD n = 935, aged ∼19 years), we attempted to replicate the BMD(C) associations that had p<1×10(-5) in an independent sample of ALSPAC children (n = 2803) and in a cohort of elderly men (MrOS Sweden, n = 1052). The rs1021188 SNP (near RANKL) was associated with BMD(C) in all cohorts (overall p = 2×10(-14), n = 5739). Each minor allele was associated with a decrease in BMD(C) of ∼0.14SD. There was also evidence for an interaction between this variant and sex (p = 0.01), with a stronger effect in males than females (at age 15, males -6.77mg/cm(3) per C allele, p = 2×10(-6); females -2.79 mg/cm(3) per C allele, p = 0.004). Furthermore, in a preliminary analysis, the rs1021188 minor C allele was associated with higher circulating levels of sRANKL (p<0.005). We show this variant to be independent from the previously aBMD associated SNP (rs9594738) and possibly from a third variant in the same RANKL region, which demonstrates important allelic heterogeneity at this locus. Associations with skeletal parameters reflecting bone dimensions were either not found or were much less pronounced. This finding implicates RANKL as a locus containing variation associated with volumetric bone density and provides further insight into the mechanism by which the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway may be involved in skeletal development.	 15940371 12748652 16234966 16598372 16723616 17701901 18455228 18445777 19079262 19181680 19016581 19671655 19700477 19801982 20472174 20534768 10980570 11137037 11237119 16007330

21102462	Thirty new loci for age at menarche identified by a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.	To identify loci for age at menarche, we performed a meta-analysis of 32 genome-wide association studies in 87,802 women of European descent, with replication in up to 14,731 women. In addition to the known loci at LIN28B (P = 5.4 × 10⁻⁶⁰) and 9q31.2 (P = 2.2 × 10⁻³³), we identified 30 new menarche loci (all P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) and found suggestive evidence for a further 10 loci (P < 1.9 × 10⁻⁶). The new loci included four previously associated with body mass index (in or near FTO, SEC16B, TRA2B and TMEM18), three in or near other genes implicated in energy homeostasis (BSX, CRTC1 and MCHR2) and three in or near genes implicated in hormonal regulation (INHBA, PCSK2 and RXRG). Ingenuity and gene-set enrichment pathway analyses identified coenzyme A and fatty acid biosynthesis as biological processes related to menarche timing.	 19079260 9093289 19079066 19471585 19263252 19812666 19805188 19880785 20026580 19812545 9059566 8543288 9722165 15779076 16107566 16528412 16788162 17455989 17434869 17550780 17572673 17601927 18344981 18758446 18728166 20398887 20714348 19448620 19448621 19448622 19448623 10716929 10770209 11476557 11914195 11925413 11987897 12796784 14570750 15342807 15514657 1622633 8276946 19079261
21102463	Genome-wide meta-analysis increases to 71 the number of confirmed Crohn's disease susceptibility loci.	We undertook a meta-analysis of six Crohn's disease genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising 6,333 affected individuals (cases) and 15,056 controls and followed up the top association signals in 15,694 cases, 14,026 controls and 414 parent-offspring trios. We identified 30 new susceptibility loci meeting genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸). A series of in silico analyses highlighted particular genes within these loci and, together with manual curation, implicated functionally interesting candidate genes including SMAD3, ERAP2, IL10, IL2RA, TYK2, FUT2, DNMT3A, DENND1B, BACH2 and TAGAP. Combined with previously confirmed loci, these results identify 71 distinct loci with genome-wide significant evidence for association with Crohn's disease.	 15753532 15908954 16221758 16282525 16782036 17068223 17143276 17447842 17554261 17641781 17873877 19915574 19351970 19864262 20031577 20032318 20304828 20562874 19890111 20570966 18439550 11748237 12820718 17936914 17952073 18587394 18199597 18776911 18836448 18809684 18819914 19159614 19158374 19290934 19440360 19474294 19543369 19557189 19438519 19625655 19701192 15177553 12955091 20562875
21104366	A genome-wide association analysis implicates SOX6 as a candidate gene for wrist bone mass.	Osteoporosis is a highly heritable common bone disease leading to fractures that severely impair the life quality of patients. Wrist fractures caused by osteoporosis are largely due to the scarcity of wrist bone mass. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of wrist bone mineral density (BMD). We examined ∼500000 SNP markers in 1000 unrelated homogeneous Caucasian subjects and found a novel allelic association with wrist BMD at rs11023787 in the SOX6 (SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 6) gene (P=9.00×10(-5)). Subjects carrying the C allele of rs11023787 in SOX6 had significantly higher mean wrist BMD values than those with the T allele (0.485:0.462 g cm(-2) for C allele vs. T allele carriers). For validation, we performed SOX6 association for BMD in an independent Chinese sample and found that SNP rs11023787 was significantly associated with wrist BMD in the Chinese sample (P=6.41×10(-3)). Meta-analyses of the GWAS scan and the replication studies yielded P-values of 5.20×10(-6) for rs11023787. Results of this study, together with the functional relevance of SOX6 in cartilage formation, support the SOX6 gene as an important gene for BMD variation.	
21107309	Genome-wide pharmacogenomic study of neurocognition as an indicator of antipsychotic treatment response in schizophrenia.	Neurocognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and, therefore, represent potentially critical outcome variables for assessing antipsychotic treatment response. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with 492K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 738 patients with schizophrenia from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study. Outcome variables consisted of a neurocognitive battery administered at multiple time points over an 18-month period, measuring processing speed, verbal memory, vigilance, reasoning, and working memory domains. Genetic mediation of improvements in each of these five domains plus a composite neurocognitive measure was assessed for each of five antipsychotics (olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone). Six SNPs achieved genome-wide significance using a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 1 in 10 findings is a false discovery. These six SNPs were located within, or in close proximity to, genes EHF, SLC26A9, DRD2, GPR137B, CHST8, and IL1A. The more robust findings, that is those significant across multiple neurocognitive domains and having adjacent SNPs showing evidence for association, were rs286913 at the EHF gene (p-value 6.99 × 10(-8), q-value 0.034, mediating the effects of ziprasidone on vigilance), rs11240594 at SLC26A9 (p-value 1.4 × 10(-7), q-value 0.068, mediating the effects of olanzapine on processing speed), and rs11677416 at IL1A (p-value 6.67 × 10(-7), q-value 0.081, mediating the effects of olanzapine on working memory). This study has generated several novel candidate genes for antipsychotic response. However, our findings will require replication and functional validation. To facilitate replication efforts, we provide all GWAS p-values for download.	 16641947 16925834 11602664 11600885 11593451 17380208 17548746 17521439 17606658 17549063 17701901 17503482 17092969 17909123 17673510 17984393 17669634 17588543 17625502 18347602 18085566 18448479 18769029 10578454 10644770 10747082 10866212 10950641 11259407 11481169 12351588 12519941 12532001 12625025 12883005 12908658 12908660 14550627 15037866 15121641 15474901 15465913 3237915 8477742 7840350 8610818 9040284 18988837 19118814 18930379 19030899 18677311 19282985 19413446 19455133 19156168 19420056 19571809 19846067 20159346 20217574 9403953 9989565 15525563 15584867 16172203
21106707	A genetic variant near the PMAIP1/Noxa gene is associated with increased bleomycin sensitivity.	Mutagen sensitivity, a measurement of chromatid breaks induced by various mutagens in short-term cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes, is an established risk factor for a number of cancers and is highly heritable. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic predictors of mutagen sensitivity. Therefore, we conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study. The primary scan analyzed 539,437 autosomal SNPs in 673 healthy individuals, followed by validations in two independent sets of 575 and 259 healthy individuals, respectively. One SNP, rs8093763, on chromosome 18q21 showed significant association with bleomycin (BLM) sensitivity (combined P = 2.64 × 10⁻⁸). We observed significantly lower BLM-induced chromotid breaks for genotypes containing wild-type allele compared with the homozygous variant genotype in the discovery set (0.71 versus 0.90, P= 3.77 × 10⁻⁵) and in replication phase 1 (0.61 versus 0.84, P= 7.00 × 10⁻⁵). The result of replication phase 2 was not statistically significant (0.65 versus 0.68, P= 0.44). This SNP is approximately 64 kb from PMAIP1/Noxa, which is a radiation-inducible gene and exhibits higher expression in BLM-sensitive lymphoblastoid cell lines than insensitive cell lines upon BLM treatment. In conclusion, we identified a biologically plausible genetic variant on 18q21 near the PMAIP1/Noxa gene that is associated with BLM sensitivity.	 18454148 18454146 19641509 19648920 20032323 10807576 11054683 12045153 12082022 12893086 14757193 6200055 3308827 2466800 2398525 1712243 8606381 9747870 10393720 10441587 15297300 15937080 16513838 16862161 17035402 17145846 17440053 17352422 17701901 17953974 18082847 18354482 18385676 18455121 18359297 18776911
21107343	SNPs on chromosome 5p15.3 associated with myocardial infarction in Japanese population.	Myocardial infarction (MI) occurs as the result of complex interactions of multiple genetic and environmental factors. By conducting a genome wide association study in a Japanese population using 210,785 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we identified a novel susceptible locus for MI on chromosome 5p15.3. An SNP (rs11748327) in this locus showed significant association in several independent cohorts (combined P = 5.3 × 10(-13), odds ratio = 0.80, comparison of allele frequency). Association study using tag SNPs in the same linkage disequilibrium block revealed that two additional SNPs (rs490556 and rs521660) conferred risk of MI. These findings indicate that the SNPs on chromosome 5p15.3 are novel protective genetic factors against MI.	
21113153	Common variants in DGKK are strongly associated with risk of hypospadias.	Hypospadias is a common congenital malformation of the male external genitalia. We performed a genome-wide association study using pooled DNA from 436 individuals with hypospadias (cases) and 494 controls of European descent and selected the highest ranked SNPs for individual genotyping in the discovery sample, an additional Dutch sample of 133 cases and their parents, and a Swedish series of 266 cases and 402 controls. Individual genotyping of two SNPs (rs1934179 and rs7063116) in DGKK, encoding diacylglycerol kinase κ, produced compelling evidence for association with hypospadias in the discovery sample (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, P = 2.5 × 10⁻¹¹ and OR = 2.3, P = 2.9 × 10⁻⁹, respectively) and in the Dutch (OR = 3.9, P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁵ and OR = 3.8, P = 3.4 × 10⁻⁵) and Swedish (OR = 2.5, P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸ and OR = 2.2, P = 2.7 × 10⁻⁶) replication samples. Expression studies showed expression of DGKK in preputial tissue of cases and controls, which was lower in carriers of the risk allele of rs1934179 (P = 0.047). We propose DGKK as a major risk gene for hypospadias.	 17667963 18067574 17579196 19008252 18426833 19751252 16174723 16553027 18276640 17283037 11832761 15266301 20215396 16254196 18375409 8447318 15297300 16957138 19734903 16210324 15472213 18042671 15845037 20638048 17160900
21118971	Genome-wide interrogation identifies YAP1 variants associated with survival of small-cell lung cancer patients.	Although most patients with small-cell lung cancer respond to chemotherapy, the survival time is highly diverse. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to examine whether germline genetic variations are prognostic factors in small-cell lung cancer patients treated with the same chemotherapy regimen. Genome-wide scan of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was performed using blood DNA to identify genotypes associated with overall survival in 245 patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, and the results were replicated in another independent set of 305 patients. Associations were estimated by Cox models and function of the variants was examined by biochemical assays. We found that rs1820453 T>G SNP within the promoter region of YAP1 on chromosome 11q22 and rs716274 A>G SNP in the region of downstream of DYNC2H1 on chromosome 11q22.3 are associated with small-cell lung cancer survival. In pooled analysis of 2 independent cohorts, the adjusted hazard ratio for patients with the rs1820453 TG or GG genotype was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.19-1.85; P = 0.0004) and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.36-2.01; P = 4.76 × 10(-7)), respectively, compared with the TT genotype; and for patients with the rs716274 AG or GG genotype was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.47-2.29; P = 8.74 × 10(-8)) and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.90-4.62; P = 1.59 × 10(-6)), respectively, compared with the AA genotype. Functional analysis showed that the rs1820453 T>G change creates a transcriptional factor binding site and results in downregulation of YAP1 expression. These results suggest that YAP1 may play an important role in prognosis of small-cell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.	
21116278	Genome-wide association with MRI atrophy measures as a quantitative trait locus for Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with considerable evidence suggesting an initiation of disease in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and spreading thereafter to the rest of the brain. In this study, we combine genetics and imaging data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the AddNeuroMed study. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for AD, we conducted a genome-wide study of atrophy in regions associated with neurodegeneration in this condition. We identified one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a disease-specific effect associated with entorhinal cortical volume in an intron of the ZNF292 gene (rs1925690; P-value=2.6 × 10(-8); corrected P-value for equivalent number of independent quantitative traits=7.7 × 10(-8)) and an intergenic SNP, flanking the ARPP-21 gene, with an overall effect on entorhinal cortical thickness (rs11129640; P-value=5.6 × 10(-8); corrected P-value=1.7 × 10(-7)). Gene-wide scoring also highlighted PICALM as the most significant gene associated with entorhinal cortical thickness (P-value=6.7 × 10(-6)).	 2540203 16862161 9258889 19689234 1985296 11832223 17943122 20100581 9781519 19236314 15501102 17476317 19668339 10190820 19734902 11735772 17653500 19734903 18400162 15249195 17924348 17701901 14997420 18302232 10984517 19543373 9628581 14685227 6610841 18974171 15499021 19906260 21157852
21105107	Genetic variations at loci involved in the immune response are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma.	Primary liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a rising incidence in Western countries. Little is known about the genetic etiology of this disease. To identify genetic factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis (LC), we conducted a comprehensive, genome-wide variation analysis in a population of unrelated Asian individuals. Copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assayed in peripheral blood with the high-density Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray platform. We used a two-stage discovery and replication design to control for overfitting and to validate observed results. We identified a strong association with CNV at the T-cell receptor gamma and alpha loci (P < 1 × 10(-15)) in HCC cases when contrasted with controls. This variation appears to be somatic in origin, reflecting differences between T-cell receptor processing in lymphocytes from individuals with liver disease and healthy individuals that is not attributable to chronic hepatitis virus infection. Analysis of constitutional variation identified three susceptibility loci including the class II MHC complex, whose protein products present antigen to T-cell receptors and mediate immune surveillance. Statistical analysis of biologic networks identified variation in the "antigen presentation and processing" pathway as being highly significantly associated with HCC (P = 1 × 10(-11)). SNP analysis identified two variants whose allele frequencies differ significantly between HCC and LC. One of these (P = 1.74 × 10(-12)) lies in the PTEN homolog TPTE2.	
21124317	Integrative genomics identifies LMO1 as a neuroblastoma oncogene.	Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all paediatric oncology deaths. To identify genetic risk factors for neuroblastoma, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,251 patients and 6,097 control subjects of European ancestry from four case series. Here we report a significant association within LIM domain only 1 (LMO1) at 11p15.4 (rs110419, combined P = 5.2 × 10(-16), odds ratio of risk allele = 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.44)). The signal was enriched in the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the disease. LMO1 encodes a cysteine-rich transcriptional regulator, and its paralogues (LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4) have each been previously implicated in cancer. In parallel, we analysed genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in 701 primary tumours. We found that the LMO1 locus was aberrant in 12.4% through a duplication event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and survival (P = 0.041). The germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles and somatic copy number gains were associated with increased LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumours, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of LMO1 inhibited growth of neuroblastoma cells with high LMO1 expression, whereas forced expression of LMO1 in neuroblastoma cells with low LMO1 expression enhanced proliferation. These data show that common polymorphisms at the LMO1 locus are strongly associated with susceptibility to developing neuroblastoma, but also may influence the likelihood of further somatic alterations at this locus, leading to malignant progression.	 11734645 20558371 14564000 15075390 831755 1461647 9209368 9732263 10197599 15930276 16778177 17586306 17471240 18463370 18724359 18923523 18923524 18923525 19141597 19412175 19536264 11751867
21182207	Variants in several genomic regions associated with asperger disorder.	Asperger disorder (ASP) is one of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and is differentiated from autism largely on the absence of clinically significant cognitive and language delays. Analysis of a homogenous subset of families with ASP may help to address the corresponding effect of genetic heterogeneity on identifying ASD genetic risk factors. To examine the hypothesis that common variation is important in ASD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 124 ASP families in a discovery data set and 110 ASP families in a validation data set. We prioritized the top 100 association results from both cohorts by employing a ranking strategy. Novel regions on 5q21.1 (P = 9.7 × 10(-7) ) and 15q22.1-q22.2 (P = 7.3 × 10(-6) ) were our most significant findings in the combined data set. Three chromosomal regions showing association, 3p14.2 (P = 3.6 × 10(-6) ), 3q25-26 (P = 6.0 × 10(-5) ) and 3p23 (P = 3.3 × 10(-4) ) overlapped linkage regions reported in Finnish ASP families, and eight association regions overlapped ASD linkage areas. Our findings suggest that ASP shares both ASD-related genetic risk factors, as well as has genetic risk factors unique to the ASP phenotype.	 14699429 17721697 17363630 11481586 17571346 4000488 11392322 17943122 8808733 17033636 18563474 11904358 15824743 16809425 18300295 19456320 17572673 16646832 7891157 15748846 18327636 17450055 16288458 18221348 15297300 9619192 14639049 19404256 15671031 18754916 18632090 16721319 17014839 20878716 11408327 16877866 17701901 17160894 9697851 17660530 10748113 16467216 3717426 15689451 19234776 18487520

CSF levels of Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p are potential early diagnostic markers for probable Alzheimer disease (AD). The influence of genetic variation on these markers has been investigated for candidate genes but not on a genome-wide basis.

21130132	Genome-wide association study of blood pressure response to methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

21131588	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus at 6p21.3 among familial CLL.	Prior genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified 10 susceptibility loci for risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To identify additional loci, we performed a GWA study in 407 CLL cases (of which 102 had a family history of CLL) and 296 controls. Moreover, given the strong familial risk of CLL, we further subset our GWA analysis to the CLL cases with a family history of CLL to identify loci specific to these familial CLL cases. Our top hits from these analyses were evaluated in an additional sample of 252 familial CLL cases and 965 controls. Using all available data, we identified and confirmed an independent association of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met genome-wide statistical significance within the IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) gene (combined P values ≤ 3.37 × 10(-8)), located in the previously identified 16q24.1 locus. Subsetting to familial CLL cases, we identified and confirmed a new locus on chromosome 6p21.3 (combined P value = 6.92 × 10(-9)). This novel region harbors the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB5 genes. Finally, we evaluated the 10 previously reported SNPs in the overall sample and replicated 8 of them. Our findings support the hypothesis that familial CLL cases have additional genetic variants not seen in sporadic CLL. Additional loci among familial CLL cases may be identified through larger studies.	 11353403 20738309 15297300 17827388 18580679 18758461 19213679 19286886 19620980 20062064 20332261 20385791 20389242 20639881 12687644
21130836	Whole genome association scan for genetic polymorphisms influencing information processing speed.	Processing speed is an important cognitive function that is compromised in psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, depression) and old age; it shares genetic background with complex cognition (e.g., working memory, reasoning). To find genes influencing speed we performed a genome-wide association scan in up to three cohorts: Brisbane (mean age 16 years; N = 1659); LBC1936 (mean age 70 years, N = 992); LBC1921 (mean age 82 years, N = 307), and; HBCS (mean age 64 years, N =1080). Meta-analysis of the common measures highlighted various suggestively significant (p < 1.21 × 10⁻⁵) SNPs and plausible candidate genes (e.g., TRIB3). A biological pathways analysis of the speed factor identified two common pathways from the KEGG database (cell junction, focal adhesion) in two cohorts, while a pathway analysis linked to the GO database revealed common pathways across pairs of speed measures (e.g., receptor binding, cellular metabolic process). These highlighted genes and pathways will be able to inform future research, including results for psychiatric disease.	 20197412 1953598 17973920 11579059 12111806 8759042 7465322 19539887 20562875 19167774 18984671 20085849 19165231 9486481 16594792 19413434 19362708 16385449 17855452 16038769 19141999 20125193 19505541 11665325 14717632 17544510 12370459 16278297 20393693 18976480 20230141 12544161 17096117 11287270 16644022 20068590 19896111 19290744 11895106 19686293 19096528 18053258 12509789 16251536 9754879 17601350 19389818 19686526 3377737 19238550 9915566 7515758 18378874 11838536 15660853 17988804 15275904 12185156 20063952 14739695 19620097
21131975	Genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma identifies two susceptibility loci on 2p21 and 11q13.3.	We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 3,772 affected individuals (cases) and 8,505 controls of European background from 11 studies and followed up 6 SNPs in 3 replication studies of 2,198 cases and 4,918 controls. Two loci on the regions of 2p21 and 11q13.3 were associated with RCC susceptibility below genome-wide significance. Two correlated variants (r² = 0.99 in controls), rs11894252 (P = 1.8 × 10⁻⁸) and rs7579899 (P = 2.3 × 10⁻⁹), map to EPAS1 on 2p21, which encodes hypoxia-inducible-factor-2 alpha, a transcription factor previously implicated in RCC. The second locus, rs7105934, at 11q13.3, contains no characterized genes (P = 7.8 × 10⁻¹⁴). In addition, we observed a promising association on 12q24.31 for rs4765623, which maps to SCARB1, the scavenger receptor class B, member 1 gene (P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸). Our study reports previously unidentified genomic regions associated with RCC risk that may lead to new etiological insights.	 9163428 6582315 14985465 19118148 16862161 20101243 11535554 10066776 18264096 9356497 17548699 17943122 19402075 18596976 20193048 16381944 16415888 17529973 8647639 14691554 19557077 18852200 17401363 18784791 18264097 20233392 17554300 19648918 11602375 12598325 14559790 20453838 17415353 20448658 19836008 11301389
21139019	A pilot genome-wide association study shows genomic variants enriched in the non-tumor cells of patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the ileum.	Genetic studies of midgut carcinoid cancer have exclusively focused on genomic changes of the tumor cells. We investigated the role of constitutional genetic polymorphisms in predisposing individuals to ileal carcinoids. In all, 239 cases and 110 controls were collected from three institutions: the Uppsala University Hospital; the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, and were genotyped using microarrays assaying >300 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association with rs2208059 in KIF16B approached statistical significance (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio=2.42, P=4.16×10(-7)) at a Bonferroni-corrected level (<1.62×10(-7)). Using two computational algorithms, four copy-number variants (CNVs) were identified in multiple cases that were absent in study controls and markedly less frequent in ∼1500 population-based controls. Of these four constitutional CNVs identified in blood-derived DNA, a 40 kb heterozygous deletion in Chr18q22.1 corresponded with a region frequently showing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in ileal carcinoid tumor cells based on our meta-analysis of previously published cytogenetic studies (69.7% LOH, 95% confidence interval=60.0-77.9%). We analyzed the constitutional 40 kb deletion on chr18 in our study samples with a real-time quantitative PCR assay; 14/226 cases (6.19%) and 2/97 controls (2.06%) carried the CNV, although the exact boundaries of each deletion have not been determined. Given the small sample size, our findings warrant an independent cohort for a replication study. Owing to the rarity of this disease, we believe these results will provide a valuable resource for future work on this serious condition by allowing others to make efficient use of their samples in targeted studies.	 9128999 16086322 19592680 16862161 12114798 18565894 17009161 14681318 20507342 16258976 18451855 9591634 8364570 17234643 19115524 17503323 19536264 12958120 19166990 19458023 17943967 15286789 2879446 12569593 11979373 16651451 19861545 20106545 15920555 18992858 11247899 9310563 17597783 17597779 11351300 18383209
21150874	A genome-wide association study for diabetic nephropathy genes in African Americans.	A genome-wide association study was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 chip to identify genes associated with diabetic nephropathy in African Americans. Association analysis was performed adjusting for admixture in 965 type 2 diabetic African American patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and in 1029 African Americans without type 2 diabetes or kidney disease as controls. The top 724 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with evidence of association to diabetic nephropathy were then genotyped in a replication sample of an additional 709 type 2 diabetes-ESRD patients and 690 controls. SNPs with evidence of association in both the original and replication studies were tested in additional African American cohorts consisting of 1246 patients with type 2 diabetes without kidney disease and 1216 with non-diabetic ESRD to differentiate candidate loci for type 2 diabetes-ESRD, type 2 diabetes, and/or all-cause ESRD. Twenty-five SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes-ESRD in the genome-wide association and initial replication. Although genome-wide significance with type 2 diabetes was not found for any of these 25 SNPs, several genes, including RPS12, LIMK2, and SFI1 are strong candidates for diabetic nephropathy. A combined analysis of all 2890 patients with ESRD showed significant association SNPs in LIMK2 and SFI1 suggesting that they also contribute to all-cause ESRD. Thus, our results suggest that multiple loci underlie susceptibility to kidney disease in African Americans with type 2 diabetes and some may also contribute to all-cause ESRD.	 2710189 19690890 7787148 8537403 8858216 15642484 15793258 15712363 15883184 16046297 16399995 17088907 17205963 10559936 10613909 10652353 11752022 11784110 11919401 11943476 12771949 12864867 14504268 17395743 17392514 17294230 17701901 17601994 17804239 18204446 18443202 18794854 18794856 18716028 19183347 19177153 19252134 19373489 19567477 19648646 20168990 20383145 20383146 19430482 7747724
21150878	Association between ORMDL3, IL1RL1 and a deletion on chromosome 17q21 with asthma risk in Australia.	Genome-wide association studies followed by replication provide a powerful approach to map genetic risk factors for asthma. We sought to search for new variants associated with asthma and attempt to replicate the association with four loci reported previously (ORMDL3, PDE4D, DENND1B and IL1RL1). Genome-wide association analyses of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rare copy number variants (CNVs) and overall CNV burden were carried out in 986 asthma cases and 1846 asthma-free controls from Australia. The most-associated locus in the SNP analysis was ORMDL3 (rs6503525, P = 4.8 × 10⁻⁷). Five other loci were associated with P < 10⁻⁵, most notably the chemokine CXC motif ligand 14 (CXCL14) gene (rs31263, P = 7.8 × 10⁻⁶). We found no evidence for association with the specific risk variants reported recently for PDE4D, DENND1B and ILR1L1. However, a variant in IL1RL1 that is in low linkage disequilibrium with that reported previously was associated with asthma risk after accounting for all variants tested (rs10197862, gene wide P = 0.01). This association replicated convincingly in an independent cohort (P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁴). A 300-kb deletion on chromosome 17q21 was associated with asthma risk, but this did not reach experiment-wide significance. Asthma cases and controls had comparable CNV rates, length and number of genes affected by deletions or duplications. In conclusion, we confirm the association between asthma risk and variants in ORMDL3 and identify a novel risk variant in IL1RL1. Follow-up of the 17q21 deletion in larger cohorts is warranted.	 9433607 20360734 15654335 15843547 17341461 17435756 17597783 17611496 17701901 17641165 17943122 18184952 18228561 18403759 18401594 18622266 18587394 18668038 18846228 18988837 19198610 19426955 19474294 19714205 19896111 20032318 20045101 20062062 19966786 19910028 20159242 20176271 20190752
21149285	Genome-wide association study identifies HLA-A*3101 allele as a genetic risk factor for carbamazepine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions in Japanese population.	An anticonvulsant, carbamazepine (CBZ), is known to show incidences of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). To identify a gene(s) susceptible to CBZ-induced cADRs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 53 subjects with the CBZ-induced cADRs, including SJS, TEN and DIHS, and 882 subjects of a general population in Japan. Among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in the GWAS, 12 SNPs showed significant association with CBZ-induced cADRs, and rs1633021 showed the smallest P-value for association with CBZ-induced cADRs (P = 1.18 × 10⁻¹³). These SNPs were located within a 430 kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 6p21.33, including the HLA-A locus. Thus, we genotyped the individual HLA-A alleles in 61 cases and 376 patients who showed no cADRs by administration of CBZ (CBZ-tolerant controls) and found that HLA-A*3101 was present in 60.7% (37/61) of the patients with CBZ-induced cADRs, but in only 12.5% (47/376) of the CBZ-tolerant controls (odds ratio = 10.8, 95% confidence interval 5.9-19.6, P = 3.64 × 10⁻¹⁵), implying that this allele has the 60.7% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity when we apply HLA-A*3101 as a risk predictor for CBZ-induced cADRs. Although DIHS is clinically distinguished from SJS and TEN, our data presented here have indicated that they share a common genetic factor as well as a common pathophysiological mechanism. Our findings should provide useful information for making a decision of individualized medication of anticonvulsants.	
21149283	Novel association to the proprotein convertase PCSK7 gene locus revealed by analysing soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels.	The level of body iron storage and the erythropoietic need for iron are indicated by the serum levels of ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), respectively. A meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies on sTfR and ferritin revealed novel association to the PCSK7 and TMPRSS6 loci for sTfR and the HFE locus for both parameters. The PCSK7 association was the most significant (rs236918, P = 1.1 × 10E-27) suggesting that proprotein convertase 7, the gene product of PCSK7, may be involved in sTfR generation and/or iron homeostasis. Conditioning the sTfR analyses on transferrin saturation abolished the HFE signal and substantially diminished the TMPRSS6 signal while the PCSK7 association was unaffected, suggesting that the former may be mediated by transferrin saturation whereas the PCSK7-associated effect on sTfR generation appears to be more direct.	 18821709 18664504 19000667 19252486 19252488 19715440 19651771 19820697 19820698 19820699 19862010 19880490 20164418 20200349 20603012 12163483 9885250 15698609 15998830 16354665 17012247 17869549 17938254 18199861 18193043 18193044 18348202 18408718 18976966
21087763	Genome-wide screen identifies rs646776 near sortilin as a regulator of progranulin levels in human plasma.	Recent studies suggest progranulin (GRN) is a neurotrophic factor. Loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting ∼10% of early-onset dementia patients. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we previously showed that GRN is detectable in human plasma and can be used to predict GRN mutation status. This study also showed a wide range in plasma GRN levels in non-GRN mutation carriers, including controls. We have now performed a genome-wide association study of 313,504 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 533 control samples and identified on chromosome 1p13.3 two SNPs with genome-wide significant association with plasma GRN levels (top SNP rs646776; p = 1.7 × 10⁻³⁰). The association of rs646776 with plasma GRN levels was replicated in two independent series of 508 controls (p = 1.9 × 10⁻¹⁹) and 197 FTLD patients (p = 6.4 × 10⁻¹²). Overall, each copy of the minor C allele decreased GRN levels by ∼15%. SNP rs646776 is located near sortilin (SORT1), and the minor C allele of rs646776 was previously associated with increased SORT1 mRNA levels. Supporting these findings, overexpression of SORT1 in cultured HeLa cells dramatically reduced GRN levels in the conditioned media, whereas knockdown of SORT1 increased extracellular GRN levels. In summary, we identified significant association of a locus on chromosome 1p13.3 with plasma GRN levels through an unbiased genome-wide screening approach and implicated SORT1 as an important regulator of GRN levels. This finding opens avenues for future research into GRN biology and the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.	 19182475 19136949 19288468 19016491 19434368 19640594 19715440 19644074 19380133 19795409 19860916 19951432 20026663 19923232 19837406 20387302 20485568 20522652 20686566 20832063 21092856 20858962 19924424 14985763 9013611 9756851 15930396 16862115 16862116 17226741 17701901 17934455 18193044 18262040 18344981 18378771 18184915 18565828 18838661 18768919 18543312 19158106

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic bile duct disease affecting 2.4-7.5% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a genome-wide association analysis of 2,466,182 SNPs in 715 individuals with PSC and 2,962 controls, followed by replication in 1,025 PSC cases and 2,174 controls. We detected non-HLA associations at rs3197999 in MST1 and rs6720394 near BCL2L11 (combined P = 1.1 × 10⁻¹⁶ and P = 4.1 × 10⁻⁸, respectively).	 19079170 19065673 16862161 19458352 18674735 19944697 16496231 20232293 15719025 19092835
21151130	Genome-wide association study identifies a locus at 7p15.2 associated with endometriosis.	Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease associated with pelvic pain and subfertility. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 3,194 individuals with surgically confirmed endometriosis (cases) and 7,060 controls from Australia and the UK. Polygenic predictive modeling showed significantly increased genetic loading among 1,364 cases with moderate to severe endometriosis. The strongest association signal was on 7p15.2 (rs12700667) for 'all' endometriosis (P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁷, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.32) and for moderate to severe disease (P = 1.5 × 10⁻⁹, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.24-1.53). We replicated rs12700667 in an independent cohort from the United States of 2,392 self-reported, surgically confirmed endometriosis cases and 2,271 controls (P = 1.2 × 10⁻³, OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.28), resulting in a genome-wide significant P value of 1.4 × 10⁻⁹ (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.13-1.27) for 'all' endometriosis in our combined datasets of 5,586 cases and 9,331 controls. rs12700667 is located in an intergenic region upstream of the plausible candidate genes NFE2L3 and HOXA10.	 9389831 20371632 9915566 9989404 10202882 10325287 10417291 15541453 16080113 11396656 11870102 11949952 12042253 12193950 12372440 12499305 14747196 15466501 3979573 7978935 8633735 16098858 16510792 17584822 17529973 17701901 17595314 17952073 17846035 18059457 18252222 18285324 18535005 18703928 19220931 19571811 19896111 20045101 20106871 20360734 20172865 20562875 20509871 20601957 9564659
21151128	Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for polycystic ovary syndrome on chromosome 2p16.3, 2p21 and 9q33.3.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic disorder in women. To identify causative genes, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PCOS in Han Chinese. The discovery set included 744 PCOS cases and 895 controls; subsequent replications involved two independent cohorts (2,840 PCOS cases and 5,012 controls from northern Han Chinese; 498 cases and 780 controls from southern and central Han Chinese). We identified strong evidence of associations between PCOS and three loci: 2p16.3 (rs13405728; combined P-value by meta-analysis P(meta) = 7.55 × 10⁻²¹, odds ratio (OR) 0.71); 2p21 (rs13429458, P(meta) = 1.73 × 10⁻²³, OR 0.67); and 9q33.3 (rs2479106, P(meta) = 8.12 × 10⁻¹⁹, OR 1.34). These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of PCOS. Follow-up studies of the candidate genes in these regions are recommended.	 15164069 17463246 19944404 12356937 15188256 16764871 17123335 16862161 19177453 15498182 16772151 16525715 20596022 17889857 18063948 11844363 19862325 11106922 15297300 19466215 20399696 10333916 15740637 19031221 8923827 14711538 13655060 9514160 19347711 11383926 18776909 18372903 13892577 11889177 15007167 17224231 11134088 19403562 19811236

To date, CCR5 variants remain the only human genetic factors to be confirmed to impact HIV-1 acquisition. However, protective CCR5 variants are largely absent in African populations, in which sporadic resistance to HIV-1 infection is still unexplained. We investigated whether common genetic variants associate with HIV-1 susceptibility in Africans.	 12499305 20887228 8751444 8791590 8918278 16284526 16738942 16862161 17701901 17641165 18256235 18398418 18568023 19115949 20041166 20205591 20887220 7965637
21156761	A genome-wide association study suggests contrasting associations in ACPA-positive versus ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be divided into two major subsets based on the presence or absence of antibodies to citrullinated peptide antigens (ACPA). Until now, data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only been published from ACPA-positive subsets of RA or from studies that have not separated the two subsets. The aim of the current study is to provide and compare GWAS data for both subsets.	 16320316 16200610 16385494 16572446 16635271 17010589 17469099 17554300 17599733 17665455 17804842 17804836 17880261 17982455 17982456 18173373 18309376 18794853 18794857 19116921 19157532 19302045 19333936 19333951 19588142 19433411 10643697 12922955 14685227 15208781 15308517 15476204 15719322 16175503 16207336 16380915
21160077	Genetic correction of PSA values using sequence variants associated with PSA levels.	Measuring serum levels of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most common screening method for prostate cancer. However, PSA levels are affected by a number of factors apart from neoplasia. Notably, around 40% of the variability of PSA levels in the general population is accounted for by inherited factors, suggesting that it may be possible to improve both sensitivity and specificity by adjusting test results for genetic effects. To search for sequence variants that associate with PSA levels, we performed a genome-wide association study and follow-up analysis using PSA information from 15,757 Icelandic and 454 British men not diagnosed with prostate cancer. Overall, we detected a genome-wide significant association between PSA levels and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at six loci: 5p15.33 (rs2736098), 10q11 (rs10993994), 10q26 (rs10788160), 12q24 (rs11067228), 17q12 (rs4430796), and 19q13.33 [rs17632542 (KLK3: I179T)], each with P(combined) <3 × 10(-10). Among 3834 men who underwent a biopsy of the prostate, the 10q26, 12q24, and 19q13.33 alleles that associate with high PSA levels are associated with higher probability of a negative biopsy (odds ratio between 1.15 and 1.27). Assessment of association between the six loci and prostate cancer risk in 5325 cases and 41,417 controls from Iceland, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, and the United States showed that the SNPs at 10q26 and 12q24 were exclusively associated with PSA levels, whereas the other four loci also were associated with prostate cancer risk. We propose that a personalized PSA cutoff value, based on genotype, should be used when deciding to perform a prostate biopsy.	 10720075 16157829 16622122 16934002 17603485 17593395 18264096 18264097 18391951 18794092 19165914 19151717 19116992 19223501 19297564 19297565 19297566 19434657 19804966 20424135 20598634 20696662 20736317 21041707 18344981
21173776	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for personality.	Personality can be thought of as a set of characteristics that influence people's thoughts, feelings and behavior across a variety of settings. Variation in personality is predictive of many outcomes in life, including mental health. Here we report on a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) data for personality in 10 discovery samples (17,375 adults) and five in silico replication samples (3294 adults). All participants were of European ancestry. Personality scores for Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were based on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Genotype data of ≈ 2.4M single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; directly typed and imputed using HapMap data) were available. In the discovery samples, classical association analyses were performed under an additive model followed by meta-analysis using the weighted inverse variance method. Results showed genome-wide significance for Openness to Experience near the RASA1 gene on 5q14.3 (rs1477268 and rs2032794, P=2.8 × 10(-8) and 3.1 × 10(-8)) and for Conscientiousness in the brain-expressed KATNAL2 gene on 18q21.1 (rs2576037, P=4.9 × 10(-8)). We further conducted a gene-based test that confirmed the association of KATNAL2 to Conscientiousness. In silico replication did not, however, show significant associations of the top SNPs with Openness and Conscientiousness, although the direction of effect of the KATNAL2 SNP on Conscientiousness was consistent in all replication samples. Larger scale GWA studies and alternative approaches are required for confirmation of KATNAL2 as a novel gene affecting Conscientiousness.	 17096117 17015813 17124108 17254420 17436240 17427203 17564524 17572673 17728769 17924335 18053258 17667963 18197199 18316677 18300295 18378874 18405382 18541026 18596250 17988414 18762592 18763692 18708274 19012654 11699599 12102386 12612864 14717632 14729423 19065144 19329489 19424496 19449983 19554673 19440164 19180564 19812666 19748081 20202923 19732485 20477721 18957941 20562875 20598278 20881960 15049747 15215300 15351774 15390211 15506864 8123478 7485811 15389754 15845033 15907162 16203747 16248708 16251536 16439008 16648327 16861305 16934002
21177773	Acetaminophen-NAPQI hepatotoxicity: a cell line model system genome-wide association study.	Acetaminophen is the leading cause of acute hepatic failure in many developed nations. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is mediated by the reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine (NAPQI). We performed a "discovery" genome-wide association study using a cell line-based model system to study the possible contribution of genomics to NAPQI-induced cytotoxicity. A total of 176 lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy subjects were treated with increasing concentrations of NAPQI. Inhibiting concentration 50 values were determined and were associated with "glutathione pathway" gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide basal messenger RNA expression, as well as with 1.3 million genome-wide SNPs. A group of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 3 was highly associated with NAPQI toxicity. The p value for rs2880961, the SNP with the lowest p value, was 1.88 × 10(-7). This group of SNPs mapped to a "gene desert," but chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of several transcription factor proteins including heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and HSF2, at or near rs2880961. These chromosome 3 SNPs were not significantly associated with variation in basal expression for any of the genome-wide genes represented on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip. We have used a cell line-based model system to identify a SNP signal associated with NAPQI cytotoxicity. If these observations are validated in future clinical studies, this SNP signal might represent a potential biomarker for risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear.	 9399875 9329933 16317692 16445100 16638819 16820551 19715440 19416960 19732725 20200426 20332169 20923822 6424115 3768250 3395122 2456051 1972496 2116803 1716097 1954453 1768573 11714888 11896290 12538238 15215394 15239078 15239082 4746329 4132259 1134886 7464816 1628537 16862161 17478681 18056202 18232020 18559526 18577746 18635433 18757419 19358737 19507324 19490595 1302042 7498656 8621113 9114986 9252660 15297300
21203500	Genomics meets glycomics-the first GWAS study of human N-Glycome identifies HNF1α as a master regulator of plasma protein fucosylation.	Over half of all proteins are glycosylated, and alterations in glycosylation have been observed in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Attached glycans significantly affect protein function; but, contrary to polypeptides, they are not directly encoded by genes, and the complex processes that regulate their assembly are poorly understood. A novel approach combining genome-wide association and high-throughput glycomics analysis of 2,705 individuals in three population cohorts showed that common variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. We show that HNF1α and its downstream target HNF4α regulate the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. Moreover, we show that HNF1α is both necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. These results reveal a new role for HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process. This mechanism has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders.	 19234473 19198612 19285412 19289501 19193056 19567438 19761587 19761541 19726492 19915572 20031592 20094651 20523905 20356825 20378934 10580125 11006292 11133780 11791212 12417423 12651883 12868606 12889654 14988562 7510548 8662894 8910301 8945470 8945471 15297300 15688014 16170870 16755287 16959566 17072008 16973733 17090579 17380156 17460662 17384015 17529977 17924335 18066955 18274891 18327257 18194658 18291023 18344517 18218651 18940312 18846099 19004187 18974171 19060906 19126970 19035662
21186350	Common variants near ATM are associated with glycemic response to metformin in type 2 diabetes.	Metformin is the most commonly used pharmacological therapy for type 2 diabetes. We report a genome-wide association study for glycemic response to metformin in 1,024 Scottish individuals with type 2 diabetes with replication in two cohorts including 1,783 Scottish individuals and 1,113 individuals from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study. In a combined meta-analysis, we identified a SNP, rs11212617, associated with treatment success (n = 3,920, P = 2.9 × 10(-9), odds ratio = 1.35, 95% CI 1.22-1.49) at a locus containing ATM, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene. In a rat hepatoma cell line, inhibition of ATM with KU-55933 attenuated the phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in response to metformin. We conclude that ATM, a gene known to be involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control, plays a role in the effect of metformin upstream of AMP-activated protein kinase, and variation in this gene alters glycemic response to metformin.	 18813293 16433709 20519126 20081858 19915572 19564453 10839993 10909077 11602624 12566409 4192270 651946 2415689 7698321 9108147 9329309 9742977 10477729 15604286 20615625 17084711 17145742 17384015 17463249 17572673 17356010 17603485 17701901 17786248 17786544 18347191 18431490 18387000 18941734 19543373
21196492	Genome-wide association study for C-reactive protein levels identified pleiotropic associations in the IL6 locus.	C-reactive protein (CRP) is a hallmark acute-phase reactant and is widely used as a blood marker for inflammation. Substantial roles of serum CRP levels in the pathogenesis of diseases have been suggested, and investigation of the mechanisms that regulate serum CRP levels would have a substantial clinical impact. Here, through genome-wide association and replication studies performed using 12 854 Japanese subjects, we identified a significant association between serum CRP levels and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of interleukin-6 (IL6) (rs2097677, P = 4.1 × 10(-11)), a typical pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine. Our study also replicated the associations in the CRP (rs3093059, P = 3.5 × 10(-21)) and HNF1A loci (rs7310409, P = 2.7 × 10(-8)). Pleiotropic association analysis with hematological and biochemical traits using 30 466 Japanese subjects demonstrated that the CRP-increasing allele of rs2097677 in the IL6 locus was significantly associated with an increased white blood cell count, platelet count and serum globulin and a decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (P < 5.0 × 10(-4)), although no pleiotropic association was observed in the CRP or HNF1A locus (α = 0.01). Our study demonstrated the pivotal role of the IL6 locus in the regulation of serum CRP levels and inflammatory pathways.	
21208937	Identification of a common variant in the TFR2 gene implicated in the physiological regulation of serum iron levels.	The genetic determinants of variation in iron status are actively sought, but remain incompletely understood. Meta-analysis of two genome-wide association (GWA) studies and replication in three independent cohorts was performed to identify genetic loci associated in the general population with serum levels of iron and markers of iron status, including transferrin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR-ferritin index. We identified and replicated a novel association of a common variant in the type-2 transferrin receptor (TFR2) gene with iron levels, with effect sizes highly consistent across samples. In addition, we identified and replicated an association between the HFE locus and ferritin and confirmed previously reported associations with the TF, TMPRSS6 and HFE genes. The five replicated variants were tested for association with expression levels of the corresponding genes in a publicly available data set of human liver samples, and nominally statistically significant expression differences by genotype were observed for all genes, although only rs3811647 in the TF gene survived the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, we measured for the first time the effects of the common variant in TMPRSS6, rs4820268, on hepcidin mRNA in peripheral blood (n = 83 individuals) and on hepcidin levels in urine (n = 529) and observed an association in the same direction, though only borderline significant. These functional findings require confirmation in further studies with larger sample sizes, but they suggest that common variants in TMPRSS6 could modify the hepcidin-iron feedback loop in clinically unaffected individuals, thus making them more susceptible to imbalances of iron homeostasis.	 20463879 20081092 17885017 17934319 17987043 18408718 18454203 18451267 18514160 18590684 18628991 18523150 18703380 18603562 18689548 18976966 19084217 19387120 19293425 19377077 19715440 19820697 19820698 19820699 19862010 10681454 10739755 10802645 11040194 11129752 14871914 15109490 15044462 8696333 10409623 18025154 15514116 15951546 16877869 16934002 17014365 17550581 19918260 19880490 20096706 20603012

21216876	Genome-wide association studies of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis suggest candidate susceptibility genes.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is an unexplained and common spinal deformity seen in otherwise healthy children. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood despite intensive investigation. Although genetic underpinnings are clear, replicated susceptibility loci that could provide insight into etiology have not been forthcoming. To address these issues, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ∼327 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 419 AIS families. We found strongest evidence of association with chromosome 3p26.3 SNPs in the proximity of the CHL1 gene (P < 8 × 10(-8) for rs1400180). We genotyped additional chromosome 3p26.3 SNPs and tested replication in two follow-up case-control cohorts, obtaining strongest results when all three cohorts were combined (rs10510181 odds ratio = 1.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-1.73, P = 2.58 × 10(-8)), but these were not confirmed in a separate GWAS. CHL1 is of interest, as it encodes an axon guidance protein related to Robo3. Mutations in the Robo3 protein cause horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS), a rare disease marked by severe scoliosis. Other top associations in our GWAS were with SNPs in the DSCAM gene encoding an axon guidance protein in the same structural class with Chl1 and Robo3. We additionally found AIS associations with loci in CNTNAP2, supporting a previous study linking this gene with AIS. Cntnap2 is also of functional interest, as it interacts directly with L1 and Robo class proteins and participates in axon pathfinding. Our results suggest the relevance of axon guidance pathways in AIS susceptibility, although these findings require further study, particularly given the apparent genetic heterogeneity in this disease.	 8116627 16778672 17932119 17943122 15688383 15897833 18307795 15708557 20410118 19883370 10096591 15105459 7968079 18178183 4767654 18077678 11986985 16204209 15297300 8981965 9627598 18208330 17189949 16123114 17436250 18948420 18171974 10372100 10547847 19424484 16894121 17701901 19369660 20516309 8921253 18256235 15136663 18386809 18760361 11443542 15653271 19095933 17202875 19196994
21216879	A genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3.	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) are involved in cell replication, proliferation, differentiation, protein synthesis, carbohydrate homeostasis and bone metabolism. Circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations predict anthropometric traits and risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. In a genome-wide association study of 10 280 middle-aged and older men and women from four community-based cohort studies, we confirmed a known association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IGFBP3 gene region on chromosome 7p12.3 with IGFBP-3 concentrations using a significance threshold of P < 5 × 10(-8) (P = 3.3 × 10(-101)). Furthermore, the same IGFBP3 gene locus (e.g. rs11977526) that was associated with IGFBP-3 concentrations was also associated with the opposite direction of effect, with IGF-I concentration after adjustment for IGFBP-3 concentration (P = 1.9 × 10(-26)). A novel and independent locus on chromosome 7p12.3 (rs700752) had genome-wide significant associations with higher IGFBP-3 (P = 4.4 × 10(-21)) and higher IGF-I (P = 4.9 × 10(-9)) concentrations; when the two measurements were adjusted for one another, the IGF-I association was attenuated but the IGFBP-3 association was not. Two additional loci demonstrated genome-wide significant associations with IGFBP-3 concentration (rs1065656, chromosome 16p13.3, P = 1.2 × 10(-11), IGFALS, a confirmatory finding; and rs4234798, chromosome 4p16.1, P = 4.5 × 10(-10), SORCS2, a novel finding). Together, the four genome-wide significant loci explained 6.5% of the population variation in IGFBP-3 concentration. Furthermore, we observed a borderline statistically significant association between IGF-I concentration and FOXO3 (rs2153960, chromosome 6q21, P = 5.1 × 10(-7)), a locus associated with longevity. These genetic loci deserve further investigation to elucidate the biological basis for the observed associations and clarify their possible role in IGF-mediated regulation of cell growth and metabolism.	 17573449 17426289 12788799 9032050 14762184 17429595 11857588 11317665 14563498 12186797 17003344 20018042 18765803 18974232 16236254 17602136 19729943 16931767 8626837 15110491 12574231 11165493 19818658 17254969 8958225 14715837 11904318 17694296 18594276 20336132 14568852 17264182 14621109 11971816 12590635 20810604 14769829 19121474 20484221 16404426 17646672 19223521 9114067 11238520 12415260 16214911 18316725 12115549
21221998	A genome-wide association analysis reveals 1p31 and 2p13.3 as susceptibility loci for Kawasaki disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limited vasculitis of infants and children that manifests as fever and signs of mucocutaneous inflammation. Coronary artery aneurysms develop in approximately 15-25% of untreated children. Although the etiology of KD is largely unknown, epidemiologic data suggest the importance of genetic factors in the susceptibility to KD. In order to identify genetic variants that influence KD susceptibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 in 186 Korean KD patients and 600 healthy controls; 18 and 26 genomic regions with one or more sequence variants were associated with KD and KD with coronary artery lesions (CALs), respectively (p < 1 × 10(-5)). Of these, one locus on chromosome 1p31 (rs527409) was replicated in 266 children with KD and 600 normal controls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.85-4.54, P (combined) = 1.46 × 10(-6)); and a PELI1 locus on chromosome 2p13.3 (rs7604693) was replicated in 86 KD patients with CALs and 600 controls (OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.77-4.12, P (combined) = 2.00 × 10(-6)). These results implicate a locus in the 1p31 region and the PELI1 gene locus in the 2p13.3 region as susceptibility loci for KD and CALs, respectively.	 15876942 7491221 15883038 17337130 11145718 14699006 20045869 18533938 18084290 15528321 12949272 17721378 16275884 2780128 2426590 14751757 15302199 19022706 12856980 15249654 9097966 8822996 15034566 19132087 9207020 10547847 3766546 15367843 17701901 15505111 20423928 3140306

21221126	Genome-wide association study of serious blistering skin rash caused by drugs.	Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but severe, potentially life threatening adverse drug reactions characterized by skin blistering. Previous studies have identified drug-specific and population-specific genetic risk factors with large effects. In this study, we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SJS/TEN induced by a variety of drugs. Our aim was to identify common genetic risk factors with large effects on SJS/TEN risk. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of 96 retrospective cases and 198 controls with a panel of over one million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We further improved power with about 4000 additional controls from publicly available datasets. No genome-wide significant associations with SNPs or copy number variants were observed, although several genomic regions were suggested that may have a role in predisposing to drug-induced SJS/TEN. Our GWAS did not find common, highly penetrant genetic risk factors responsible for SJS/TEN events in the cases selected.	
21228123	IL-28B predicts response to chronic hepatitis C therapy--fine-mapping and replication study in Asian populations.	Type I interferon (IFN) is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Despite advances in antiviral therapy, a large proportion of patients remain infected following current therapies. Through a genome-wide scan, we found two variants (rs8099917 and rs12979860) in the IL-28B locus that affect the outcome of PEG-IFN and ribavirin combination therapy, consistent with recent studies (P = 6.52×10(-8); odds ratio 2.46 and P = 8.63×10(-8), odds ratio 2.40, respectively). Significant associations were also observed in the case of IFN monotherapy for HCV genotypes 1b and 2a. With rs8099917, HCV genotype 1b patients had a significantly lower frequency of the favourable genotype (86.6 %) compared with healthy controls (91.7 %), and HCV genotype 2a patients had an intermediate frequency (89.9 %). Similar results were found for rs12979860. Fine-mapping analysis revealed that rs8099917 had the strongest association with treatment outcome and 14 others, including four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms, had comparable associations. Haplotype analysis revealed that none of the haplotypes showed stronger association than any single marker. Early non-responders who could not achieve 2 log viral decline during the first 12 weeks of treatment had higher odds ratios for these two variants. The favourable allele of rs8099917 is also associated with initial viral decline at 2 and 4 weeks following the start of therapy. Multivariate analysis of PEG-IFN and ribavirin-treated patients showed that rs8099917 genotype, viral load, fibrosis and age were significant predictors of response to therapy. Common variation at the IL-28B locus is predictive of various IFN-based therapies for HCV independent of regimen or HCV genotype.

Nevertheless, the knowledge of MS genetics remains incomplete, with many risk alleles still to be revealed.	 14685227 14975175 15824338 16193885 16625214 17006452 17252545 17261686 17444504 17492755 17660530 17666406 17785539 17952073 18490360 18542080 18930111 18970977 19010793 19242548 19286671 19380721 19482860 19525953 19525955 19571811 19617918 19846760 19879194 2301392 9634526 20186855 16905561 18195134 18565446 18843511 19022862 19233038 19237575 19667218 12734009 14569025
21263130	Novel breast cancer susceptibility locus at 9q31.2: results of a genome-wide association study.	Genome-wide association studies have identified several common genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk. It is likely, however, that a substantial proportion of such loci have not yet been discovered.

21298027	A meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans identifies IL18RAP, PTPN2, TAGAP, and PUS10 as shared risk loci for Crohn's disease and celiac disease.	Crohn's disease (CD) and celiac disease (CelD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, involving genetic and environmental factors in their pathogenesis. The two diseases can co-occur within families, and studies suggest that CelD patients have a higher risk to develop CD than the general population. These observations suggest that CD and CelD may share common genetic risk loci. Two such shared loci, IL18RAP and PTPN2, have already been identified independently in these two diseases. The aim of our study was to explicitly identify shared risk loci for these diseases by combining results from genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of CD and CelD. Specifically, GWAS results from CelD (768 cases, 1,422 controls) and CD (3,230 cases, 4,829 controls) were combined in a meta-analysis. Nine independent regions had nominal association p-value <1.0 x 10⁻⁵ in this meta-analysis and showed evidence of association to the individual diseases in the original scans (p-value < 1 x 10⁻² in CelD and < 1 x 10⁻³ in CD). These include the two previously reported shared loci, IL18RAP and PTPN2, with p-values of 3.37 x 10⁻⁸ and 6.39 x 10⁻⁹, respectively, in the meta-analysis. The other seven had not been reported as shared loci and thus were tested in additional CelD (3,149 cases and 4,714 controls) and CD (1,835 cases and 1,669 controls) cohorts. Two of these loci, TAGAP and PUS10, showed significant evidence of replication (Bonferroni corrected p-values <0.0071) in the combined CelD and CD replication cohorts and were firmly established as shared risk loci of genome-wide significance, with overall combined p-values of 1.55 x 10⁻¹⁰ and 1.38 x 10⁻¹¹ respectively. Through a meta-analysis of GWAS data from CD and CelD, we have identified four shared risk loci: PTPN2, IL18RAP, TAGAP, and PUS10. The combined analysis of the two datasets provided the power, lacking in the individual GWAS for single diseases, to detect shared loci with a relatively small effect.	 15973121 16375659 16570073 16766754 17499605 17499606 17554261 17558408 17572673 17538633 20004761 19861958 20190752 20228799 17701901 18311140 18439550 18587394 19073967 18824555 19200528 19299378 19201773 19519468
21298047	The nuclear transcription factor PKNOX2 is a candidate gene for substance dependence in European-origin women.	Substance dependence or addiction is a complex environmental and genetic disorder that results in serious health and socio-economic consequences. Multiple substance dependence categories together, rather than any one individual addiction outcome, may explain the genetic variability of such disorder. In our study, we defined a composite substance dependence phenotype derived from six individual diagnoses: addiction to nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates or other drugs as a whole. Using data from several genomewide case-control studies, we identified a strong (Odds ratio  = 1.77) and significant (p-value = 7E-8) association signal with a novel gene, PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 2 (PKNOX2), on chromosome 11 with the composite phenotype in European-origin women. The association signal is not as significant when individual outcomes for addiction are considered, or in males or African-origin population. Our findings underscore the importance of considering multiple addiction types and the importance of considering population and gender stratification when analyzing data with heterogeneous population.	 18205015 16251987 18227835 18300295 18629733 19165137 19238175 11545662 11549286 12555233 15024690 7907720 7485844 8651462 8947252 9031816 9347089 9603606 9819065 10402507 15297300 16618939 16838244 16961766 16934005 17170166 17135278 17158188 17458324 17701901 17716221 18005446 18243582
21273288	Genome-wide association analysis and fine mapping of NT-proBNP level provide novel insight into the role of the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB gene cluster.	High blood concentration of the N-terminal cleavage product of the B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is strongly associated with cardiac dysfunction and is increasingly used for heart failure diagnosis. To identify genetic variants associated with NT-proBNP level, we performed a genome-wide association analysis in 1325 individuals from South Tyrol, Italy, and followed up the most significant results in 1746 individuals from two German population-based studies. A genome-wide significant signal in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB gene cluster was replicated, after correction for multiple testing (replication one-sided P-value = 8.4 × 10(-10)). A conditional regression analysis of 128 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of interest identified novel variants in the CLCN6 gene as independently associated with NT-proBNP. In this locus, four haplotypes were associated with increased NT-proBNP levels (haplotype-specific combined P-values from 8.3 × 10(-03) to 9.3 × 10(-11)). The observed increase in the NT-proBNP level was proportional to the number of haplotype copies present (i.e. dosage effect), with an increase associated with two copies that varied between 20 and 100 pg/ml across populations. The identification of novel variants in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB cluster provides new insights into the biological mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction.	 10085286 7657802 16032514 16222710 16412859 16490960 16958597 17340039 17384013 17384015 17558597 17495021 17550581 17903293 17924335 17943122 17890443 17567649 18060068 18300295 18436476 18723445 18974171 19215730 19219041 19171656 19715440 20031538 20616382 19430483 14633912 11106640 11558679 11867360 12821537 12890927 12928253 12958120 14681465 14656906 14967157 14997420 15061354 15579415

21254220	Propensity score-based nonparametric test revealing genetic variants underlying bipolar disorder.	Association analysis has led to the identification of many genetic variants for complex diseases. While assessing the association between genes and a disease, other factors can play an important role. The consequence of not considering covariates (such as population stratification and environmental factors) is well-documented in genetic studies. We introduce a nonparametric test of association that adjusts for covariate effects. Specifically, the adjustment is realized through weights that are constructed from genomic propensity scores that summarize the contribution of all covariates. The benefit of our test is demonstrated through an important data set on bipolar disorder (BD) collected by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. When compared to other tests, our test identified an unreported region with three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 16 that show strong evidence of association (P-value <5 × 10(-7)). This region is near the RPGRIP1L gene known to be associated with BD. A haplotype block including these three SNPs was further discovered to be strongly associated with BD. It is also interesting to note that our nonparametric test did not reveal strong signals at two SNPs that were detected by a covariate-adjusted parametric test. This suggests that different methods of covariate adjustment can complement each other. Thus, we recommend using both parametric and nonparametric testing. Additionally, we performed simulation studies to compare our proposed test with the unadjusted test and an adjusted parametric test. Our finding underscores the importance of accommodating and controlling for covariate effects in discovering genetic variants associated with complex disorders.	 19353632 11315092 16862161 18677311 17086513 17068223 15761122 20711441 18048322 17323371 15297300 16648850 16219774 10364535 17554300 10782012 14871868 11055368 8839128 19219893 19844207
21348951	Hypertrophy-associated polymorphisms ascertained in a founder cohort applied to heart failure risk and mortality.	A three-stage approach was undertaken using genome-wide, case-control, and case-only association studies to identify genetic variants associated with heart failure mortality. In an Amish founder population (n = 851), cardiac hypertrophy, a trait integral to the adaptive response to failure, was found to be heritable (h² = 0.28, p = 0.0002) and GWAS revealed 21 candidate hypertrophy SNPs. In a case (n = 1,610)-control (n = 463) study in unrelated Caucasians, one of the SNPs associated with hypertrophy (rs2207418, p = 8 × 10⁻⁶), was associated with heart failure, RR = 1.85(1.25-2.73, p = 0.0019). In heart failure cases rs2207418 was associated with increased mortality, HR = 1.51(1.20-1.97, p = 0.0004). There was consistency between studies, with the GG allele being associated with increased ventricular mass (~13 g/m²) in the Amish, heart failure risk, and heart failure mortality. This SNP is in a gene desert of chromosome 20p12. Five genes are within 2.0 mbp of rs2207418 but with low LD between their SNPs and rs2207418. A region near this SNP is highly conserved in multiple vertebrates (lod score = 1,208). This conservation and the internal consistency across studies suggests that this region has biologic importance in heart failure, potentially acting as an enhancer or repressor element. rs2207418 may be useful for predicting a more progressive form of heart failure that may require aggressive therapy.	 11152664 3435047 11716909 20445134 10220506 17263807 19768177 2139921 20438756 2936235 17720887 16024819 19584346 20400778 15297300 9545414 10760314 18425130 4531429 15621217 17389260 16228142 12668592 11775131 11348601 20201887 17898540 9731693
21294900	A genome-wide association study of serum uric acid in African Americans.	Uric acid is the primary byproduct of purine metabolism. Hyperuricemia is associated with body mass index (BMI), sex, and multiple complex diseases including gout, hypertension (HTN), renal disease, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry (EA) have reported associations between serum uric acid levels (SUAL) and specific genomic loci. The purposes of this study were: 1) to replicate major signals reported in EA populations; and 2) to use the weak LD pattern in African ancestry population to better localize (fine-map) reported loci and 3) to explore the identification of novel findings cognizant of the moderate sample size.	 18443007 11315092 15843466 16862161 18487473 15014177 18237431 19260141 19752530 15660328 10075613 19609347 11961098 14739288 17130256 20752582 15610247 18776908 15557387 11711505 18842065 19503597 18327256 18834626 20027299 17190309 16234313 12215479 18854744 18946066 20139978 17701901 18327257 18776909 19861489 19918757 18759275 19237717 18799720 18179892
21326860	Identification of novel susceptibility Loci for kawasaki disease in a Han chinese population by a genome-wide association study.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome that primarily affects infants and young children. Its etiology is unknown; however, epidemiological findings suggest that genetic predisposition underlies disease susceptibility. Taiwan has the third-highest incidence of KD in the world, after Japan and Korea. To investigate novel mechanisms that might predispose individuals to KD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 250 KD patients and 446 controls in a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan, and further validated our findings in an independent Han Chinese cohort of 208 cases and 366 controls. The most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in the joint analysis corresponded to three novel loci. Among these KD-associated SNPs three were close to the COPB2 (coatomer protein complex beta-2 subunit) gene: rs1873668 (p = 9.52×10⁻⁵), rs4243399 (p = 9.93×10⁻⁵), and rs16849083 (p = 9.93×10⁻⁵). We also identified a SNP in the intronic region of the ERAP1 (endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidase 1) gene (rs149481, p(best) = 4.61×10⁻⁵). Six SNPs (rs17113284, rs8005468, rs10129255, rs2007467, rs10150241, and rs12590667) clustered in an area containing immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions genes, with p(best)-values between 2.08×10⁻⁵ and 8.93×10⁻⁶, were also identified. This is the first KD GWAS performed in a Han Chinese population. The novel KD candidates we identified have been implicated in T cell receptor signaling, regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as antibody-mediated immune responses. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis of KD.	 19690332 19237439 10979916 11230614 19190534 12189246 12748171 14662887 15272416 236368 634680 2113446 1447658 8822996 9550392 9832593 15164145 15574600 15574639 16282773 16286653 16534213 17160344 17873122 18084290 18710885 19132087 19180512 19692350
21297633	Meta-analysis identifies 29 additional ulcerative colitis risk loci, increasing the number of confirmed associations to 47.	Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies in ulcerative colitis have identified 18 susceptibility loci. We conducted a meta-analysis of six ulcerative colitis genome-wide association study datasets, comprising 6,687 cases and 19,718 controls, and followed up the top association signals in 9,628 cases and 12,917 controls. We identified 29 additional risk loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)), increasing the number of ulcerative colitis-associated loci to 47. After annotating associated regions using GRAIL, expression quantitative trait loci data and correlations with non-synonymous SNPs, we identified many candidate genes that provide potentially important insights into disease pathogenesis, including IL1R2, IL8RA-IL8RB, IL7R, IL12B, DAP, PRDM1, JAK2, IRF5, GNA12 and LSP1. The total number of confirmed inflammatory bowel disease risk loci is now 99, including a minimum of 28 shared association signals between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.	 11113872 11062503 12874249 2787769 8168136 15684321 15728239 16412046 17653185 17660817 17881657 17967903 18285450 18439550 18438405 18519647 18563156 18725523 18523026 18758464 19201773 19468064 19578435 19664942 19915572 19915573 20190752 20228798 20228799 20537536 20630662 21102463

21305692	Genome-wide association analysis of age at onset and psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several susceptibility loci for bipolar disorder (BP), most notably ANK3. However, most of the inherited risk for BP remains unexplained. One reason for the limited success may be the genetic heterogeneity of BP. Clinical sub-phenotypes of BP may identify more etiologically homogeneous subsets of patients, which can be studied with increased power to detect genetic variation. Here, we report on a mega-analysis of two widely studied sub-phenotypes of BP, age at onset and psychotic symptoms, which are familial and clinically significant. We combined data from three GWAS: NIMH Bipolar Disorder Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN-BP), NIMH Bipolar Disorder Genome Study (BiGS), and a German sample. The combined sample consisted of 2,836 BP cases with information on sub-phenotypes and 2,744 controls. Imputation was performed, resulting in 2.3 million SNPs available for analysis. No SNP reached genome-wide significance for either sub-phenotype. In addition, no SNP reached genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis with an independent replication sample. We had 80% power to detect associations with a common SNP at an OR of 1.6 for psychotic symptoms and a mean difference of 1.8 years in age at onset. Age at onset and psychotic symptoms in BP may be influenced by many genes of smaller effect sizes or other variants not measured well by SNP arrays, such as rare alleles.	 16255080 16175501 16449477 16542184 16862161 17012686 16958032 17554300 17505464 17671286 17701901 17767148 18200594 18242852 18198266 18421293 18317468 18711365 19416921 19127563 19539887 19488044 19715440 19931040 20081856 20452754 20616382 16263850 10712207 11343533 11481160 12668356 12727708 12772088 678037 2955008 1918191 7944874 15812168 15939841
21307088	Genome-wide association studies in Asians confirm the involvement of ATOH7 and TGFBR3, and further identify CARD10 as a novel locus influencing optic disc area.	Damage to the optic nerve (e.g. from glaucoma) has an adverse and often irreversible impact on vision. Earlier studies have suggested that the size of the optic nerve head could be governed by hereditary factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 4445 Singaporean individuals (n = 2132 of Indian and n = 2313 of Malay ancestry, respectively), with replication in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (n = 9326 individuals of Caucasian ancestry) using the most widely reported parameter for optic disc traits, the optic disc area. We identified a novel locus on chromosome 22q13.1, CARD10, which strongly associates with optic disc area in both Singaporean cohorts as well as in the Rotterdam Study (RS; rs9607469, per-allele change in optic disc area = 0.051 mm(2); P(meta) = 2.73×10(-12)) and confirmed the association between CDC7/TGFBR3 (lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1192415, P(meta) = 7.57×10(-17)) and ATOH7 (lead SNP rs7916697, P(meta) = 2.00 × 10(-15)) and optic disc area in Asians. This is the first Asian-based GWAS on optic disc area, identifying a novel locus for the optic disc area, but also confirming the results found in Caucasian persons suggesting that there are general genetic determinants applicable to the size of the optic disc across different ethnicities.	
21347282	Genome-wide association study of coronary heart disease and its risk factors in 8,090 African Americans: the NHLBI CARe Project.	Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality in African Americans. To identify common genetic polymorphisms associated with CHD and its risk factors (LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), hypertension, smoking, and type-2 diabetes) in individuals of African ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,090 African Americans from five population-based cohorts. We replicated 17 loci previously associated with CHD or its risk factors in Caucasians. For five of these regions (CHD: CDKN2A/CDKN2B; HDL-C: FADS1-3, PLTP, LPL, and ABCA1), we could leverage the distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in African Americans to identify DNA polymorphisms more strongly associated with the phenotypes than the previously reported index SNPs found in Caucasian populations. We also developed a new approach for association testing in admixed populations that uses allelic and local ancestry variation. Using this method, we discovered several loci that would have been missed using the basic allelic and global ancestry information only. Our conclusions suggest that no major loci uniquely explain the high prevalence of CHD in African Americans. Our project has developed resources and methods that address both admixture- and SNP-association to maximize power for genetic discovery in even larger African-American consortia.	 17478681 17478679 17701901 18193043 18193044 18372903 18776909 19060906 19060911 19198609 19198610 19198612 19474294 19609347 19715440 20040588 20400458 20400780 20686565 20616382 11177703 10892820 20634204 12456228 15088269 9234837 9253218 16862161 17206141 17554300 17634449
21347284	Genome-wide association studies of the PR interval in African Americans.	The PR interval on the electrocardiogram reflects atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time. The PR interval is heritable, provides important information about arrhythmia risk, and has been suggested to differ among human races. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified common genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, but there is a general paucity of GWA studies in individuals of African ancestry. We performed GWA studies in African American individuals from four cohorts (n = 6,247) to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. Imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. We observed a strong signal (rs3922844) within the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) with genome-wide significant association (p<2.5 x 10⁻⁸) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans (beta  = 5.1 msec per minor allele, 95% CI  = 4.1-6.1, p = 3 x 10⁻²³). This SNP was also associated with PR interval (beta = 2.4 msec per minor allele, 95% CI = 1.8-3.0, p = 3 x 10⁻¹⁶) in individuals of European ancestry (n = 14,042), but with a smaller effect size (p for heterogeneity <0.001) and variability explained (0.5%). Further meta-analysis of the four cohorts identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A (rs6798015), MEIS1 (rs10865355), and TBX5 (rs7312625) that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration (13.3 msec, p = 0.009) in one but not the other three cohorts. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.	 19549974 19543370 20062060 20062061 20062063 20040588 20395969 20400780 10712219 11315092 12154384 12193783 12397006 15088269 7188949 2919564 2646917 7881656 16255080 16320381 16862161 16934002 17701901 17903306 18348202 18776908 18776909 18794856 18974833 19151713 19213946 19389651 19407144 19715440

21379329	Genome-wide association of familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease replicates BIN1 and CLU and nominates CUGBP2 in interaction with APOE.	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. The National Institute of Aging-Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease conducted a joint genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiplex LOAD families (3,839 affected and unaffected individuals from 992 families plus additional unrelated neurologically evaluated normal subjects) using the 610 IlluminaQuad panel. This cohort represents the largest family-based GWAS of LOAD to date, with analyses limited here to the European-American subjects. SNPs near APOE gave highly significant results (e.g., rs2075650, p = 3.2×10(-81)), but no other genome-wide significant evidence for association was obtained in the full sample. Analyses that stratified on APOE genotypes identified SNPs on chromosome 10p14 in CUGBP2 with genome-wide significant evidence for association within APOE ε4 homozygotes (e.g., rs201119, p = 1.5×10(-8)). Association in this gene was replicated in an independent sample consisting of three cohorts. There was evidence of association for recently-reported LOAD risk loci, including BIN1 (rs7561528, p = 0.009 with, and p = 0.03 without, APOE adjustment) and CLU (rs11136000, p = 0.023 with, and p = 0.008 without, APOE adjustment), with weaker support for CR1. However, our results provide strong evidence that association with PICALM (rs3851179, p = 0.69 with, and p = 0.039 without, APOE adjustment) and EXOC3L2 is affected by correlation with APOE, and thus may represent spurious association. Our results indicate that genetic structure coupled with ascertainment bias resulting from the strong APOE association affect genome-wide results and interpretation of some recently reported associations. We show that a locus such as APOE, with large effects and strong association with disease, can lead to samples that require appropriate adjustment for this locus to avoid both false positive and false negative evidence of association. We suggest that similar adjustments may also be needed for many other large multi-site studies.	 3579492 20457951 9343467 12648751 11315092 3345066 15745979 12574495 19136949 17092867 17317784 16862161 8618660 17101828 7596406 16849325 19333967 20206333 15834813 9867708 19001172 8618665 19639606 16151517 17474819 18976728 18430993 14564669 5365894 16461860 3306405 19020537 9803265 8554056 9678314 20862329 9360908 19424496 19191270 9057348 10190820 12490529 1671712 19118814 12566388 19734902 9671984 19184668 12891668 16504672 19362756 16175510 11968087 2682321 12566741 11095994 2011243 19734903 14614235 9514594 16095752 3712289 7485228 17044866 10738542 9195155 20554627 7920638 20460622 9520135 10053019 10631151 4648793 15248153 12663552 15389756 11790235 7104545 18823527 19473078 11113612 19668339 8346443 20333730 12929084 18642345 16389594 9508150 20697030 18208327 16847012 6610841 17553421 10600044 11156625 17434289 9198315 7638622 18449908 11855957
21326295	Genome-wide analysis identifies a quantitative trait locus in the MHC class II region associated with generalized vitiligo age of onset.	Generalized vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease in which acquired patchy depigmentation of skin, hair, and mucous membranes results from loss of melanocytes from involved areas. Previous genetic analyses have focused on vitiligo susceptibility, and have identified a number of genes involved in disease risk. Age of onset of generalized vitiligo also involves a substantial genetic component, but has not previously been studied systematically. In this study, we report a genome-wide association study of vitiligo age of onset in 1,339 generalized vitiligo patients, with replication in an independent cohort of 677 cases. We identified a quantitative trait locus for vitiligo age of onset in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region, located near c6orf10-BTNL2 (rs7758128; P=8.14 × 10(-11)), a region that is also associated with generalized vitiligo susceptibility. In contrast, there was no association of vitiligo age of onset with any other MHC or non-MHC loci that are associated with vitiligo susceptibility. These findings highlight the differing roles played by genes involved in vitiligo susceptibility versus vitiligo age of onset, and illustrate that genome-wide analyses can be used to identify genes involved in quantitative aspects of disease natural history, as well as disease susceptibility per se.	 19143815 20526340 16690410 11144287 16984233 16862161 11754475 16420246 15735647 8352624 20526339 19659809 19937997 19680446 19373277 18460890 12753387 21085187 15297300 18852200 20959028 17701901 19287509 11254454 17658994 20410501 16029422
21326311	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic variants influencing F-cell levels in sickle-cell patients.	Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) level has emerged as an important prognostic factor in sickle-cell disease (SCD) and can be measured by the proportion of HbF-containing erythrocytes (F-cells). Recently, BCL11A (zinc-finger protein) was identified as a regulator of HbF, and the strongest association signals were observed either directly for rs766432 or for correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To identify additional independently associated genetic variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the proportion of F-cells in individuals of African ancestry with SCD from the Silent Infarct Transfusion (SIT) Trial cohort. Our study not only confirms the association of rs766432 (P-value <3.32 × 10(-13)), but also identifies an independent novel intronic SNP, rs7606173, associated with F-cells (P-value <1.81 × 10(-15)). The F-cell variances explained independently by these two SNPs are ∼13% (rs7606173) and ∼11% (rs766432), whereas, together they explain ∼16%. Additionally, in men, we identify a novel locus on chromosome 17, glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP2R), associated with F-cell regulation (rs12103880; P-value <3.41 × 10(-8)). GLP2R encodes a G protein-coupled receptor and involved in proliferative and anti-apoptotic cellular responses. These findings highlight the importance of denser genetic screens and suggest further exploration of the BCL11A and GLP2R loci to gain additional insight into HbF/F-cell regulation.	 1379090 11315092 4681897 101847 16862161 7530809 18691915 6187355 16255080 19369657 19716196 13536251 19056937 12029063 20401335 18667698 17225249 804182 20018918 15297300 20183929 20233392 18245381 21057501 17767159 21058334 10607722 16266409 8528252 7993409 17701901 2412616 20981092 9859924 11254454 373818 20201689 18107723 1710777 2461753

21353194	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic variation in neurocan as a susceptibility factor for bipolar disorder.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a follow-up study of bipolar disorder (BD), a common neuropsychiatric disorder. In the GWAS, we investigated 499,494 autosomal and 12,484 X-chromosomal SNPs in 682 patients with BD and in 1300 controls. In the first follow-up step, we tested the most significant 48 SNPs in 1729 patients with BD and in 2313 controls. Eight SNPs showed nominally significant association with BD and were introduced to a meta-analysis of the GWAS and the first follow-up samples. Genetic variation in the neurocan gene (NCAN) showed genome-wide significant association with BD in 2411 patients and 3613 controls (rs1064395, p = 3.02 × 10(-8); odds ratio = 1.31). In a second follow-up step, we replicated this finding in independent samples of BD, totaling 6030 patients and 31,749 controls (p = 2.74 × 10(-4); odds ratio = 1.12). The combined analysis of all study samples yielded a p value of 2.14 × 10(-9) (odds ratio = 1.17). Our results provide evidence that rs1064395 is a common risk factor for BD. NCAN encodes neurocan, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, which is thought to be involved in cell adhesion and migration. We found that expression in mice is localized within cortical and hippocampal areas. These areas are involved in cognition and emotion regulation and have previously been implicated in BD by neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and postmortem studies.	 11486035 19488044 12177636 655775 678037 7103676 3344216 2190539 1637252 1326557 1483169 7944874 7966923 7620606 8637956 8931163 9705269 15812168 16032514 16255080 16490960 17210695 17463246 17554300 17701901 17762510 17486107 18421293 18317468 18852200 18974171 18711365 19286556 19339764 19088739 19416921 19535498
21383967	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in celiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis identifies fourteen non-HLA shared loci.	Epidemiology and candidate gene studies indicate a shared genetic basis for celiac disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the extent of this sharing has not been systematically explored. Previous studies demonstrate that 6 of the established non-HLA CD and RA risk loci (out of 26 loci for each disease) are shared between both diseases. We hypothesized that there are additional shared risk alleles and that combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from each disease would increase power to identify these shared risk alleles. We performed a meta-analysis of two published GWAS on CD (4,533 cases and 10,750 controls) and RA (5,539 cases and 17,231 controls). After genotyping the top associated SNPs in 2,169 CD cases and 2,255 controls, and 2,845 RA cases and 4,944 controls, 8 additional SNPs demonstrated P<5 × 10(-8) in a combined analysis of all 50,266 samples, including four SNPs that have not been previously confirmed in either disease: rs10892279 near the DDX6 gene (P(combined) =  1.2 × 10(-12)), rs864537 near CD247 (P(combined) =  2.2 × 10(-11)), rs2298428 near UBE2L3 (P(combined) =  2.5 × 10(-10)), and rs11203203 near UBASH3A (P(combined) =  1.1 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed that 4 gene loci previously established in either CD or RA are associated with the other autoimmune disease at combined P<5 × 10(-8) (SH2B3, 8q24, STAT4, and TRAF1-C5). From the 14 shared gene loci, 7 SNPs showed a genome-wide significant effect on expression of one or more transcripts in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block around the SNP. These associations implicate antigen presentation and T-cell activation as a shared mechanism of disease pathogenesis and underscore the utility of cross-disease meta-analysis for identification of genetic risk factors with pleiotropic effects between two clinically distinct diseases.	 18349094 17982456 18311140 18587394 18794853 18794857 18852200 19092835 19073967 19503088 19557189 19240061 19714648 19648290 19838193 19898481 19915574 20190752 20383147 20453842 20498205 20686565 20601676 20881960 20935630 20854658 10799879 12087419 15004560 15072848 15177553 15208781 9930702 10415122 17384015 17554300 17558408 17572673 17701901 17804842 17804836 17999365 18344182
21390209	Meta-analysis for genome-wide association study identifies multiple variants at the BIN1 locus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.	Recent GWAS studies focused on uncovering novel genetic loci related to AD have revealed associations with variants near CLU, CR1, PICALM and BIN1. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in an independent set of 1034 cases and 1186 controls using the Illumina genotyping platforms. By coupling our data with available GWAS datasets from the ADNI and GenADA, we replicated the original associations in both PICALM (rs3851179) and CR1 (rs3818361). The PICALM variant seems to be non-significant after we adjusted for APOE e4 status. We further tested our top markers in 751 independent cases and 751 matched controls. Besides the markers close to the APOE locus, a marker (rs12989701) upstream of BIN1 locus was replicated and the combined analysis reached genome-wide significance level (p = 5E-08). We combined our data with the published Harold et al. study and meta-analysis with all available 6521 cases and 10360 controls at the BIN1 locus revealed two significant variants (rs12989701, p = 1.32E-10 and rs744373, p = 3.16E-10) in limited linkage disequilibrium (r²  =  0.05) with each other. The independent contribution of both SNPs was supported by haplotype conditional analysis. We also conducted multivariate analysis in canonical pathways and identified a consistent signal in the downstream pathways targeted by Gleevec (P = 0.004 in Pfizer; P = 0.028 in ADNI and P = 0.04 in GenADA). We further tested variants in CLU, PICALM, BIN1 and CR1 for association with disease progression in 597 AD patients where longitudinal cognitive measures are sufficient. Both the PICALM and CLU variants showed nominal significant association with cognitive decline as measured by change in Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score from the baseline but did not pass multiple-test correction. Future experiments will help us better understand potential roles of these genetic loci in AD pathology.	 20431570 20200346 20460622 20420935 20534741 20811458 17966091 11748137 11879655 12569356 12668730 12773571 14523244 8782822 9343467 9395479 9720601 9920359 15829527 16002400 16369530 16461860 17317784 17474819 17553421 17701901 17676042 17998437 18631958 18852200 18976728 19136949 19225519 19668339 19715440 19734902 19734903 19915575 19915576 19915558 20061627 20451875
21364930	Genome-wide association study identifies single nucleotide polymorphism in DYRK1A associated with replication of HIV-1 in monocyte-derived macrophages.	HIV-1 infected macrophages play an important role in rendering resting T cells permissive for infection, in spreading HIV-1 to T cells, and in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. During highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART), macrophages keep producing virus because tissue penetration of antiretrovirals is suboptimal and the efficacy of some is reduced. Thus, to cure HIV-1 infection with antiretrovirals we will also need to efficiently inhibit viral replication in macrophages. The majority of the current drugs block the action of viral enzymes, whereas there is an abundance of yet unidentified host factors that could be targeted. We here present results from a genome-wide association study identifying novel genetic polymorphisms that affect in vitro HIV-1 replication in macrophages.	 12766761 18974171 18195140 7962525 16862161 16511445 8083612 10835412 10482270 20041166 18260759 11518709 12853962 16502135 9671771 19535121 3258626 16055722 9744279 11448156 11751414 17273559 9932450 10470075 20221911 17572673 19759136 19857521 10954888 11060313 17933568 19213682 18348731 17225249 15068245 20064070 11598182 10608788 15199315 12138125 12103427 9075924 7585008 16887991 9854115 15297300 8996241 16873279 10600603 17205196 9420271 15668551 15068246 19342095 9699154 20018391 17325726 15955449 19148268 10979604 12167337 9238043 8332492 7486867 19685005 19211771 18854154 19372796 18187620 10893419 3016903 8892900 15367641 10233948 10451162 19754311 11602752 20042471 16554754 18256235 11311120 15977645 9653086 18976975 18927109 7528513 1690236 19470482 12142037 10553788 19115949 19460752 11156964 19417063 9759480 10846592
21355061	CUBN is a gene locus for albuminuria.	Identification of genetic risk factors for albuminuria may alter strategies for early prevention of CKD progression, particularly among patients with diabetes. Little is known about the influence of common genetic variants on albuminuria in both general and diabetic populations. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 63,153 individuals of European ancestry with genotype information from genome-wide association studies (CKDGen Consortium) and from a large candidate gene study (CARe Consortium) to identify susceptibility loci for the quantitative trait urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and the clinical diagnosis microalbuminuria. We identified an association between a missense variant (I2984V) in the CUBN gene, which encodes cubilin, and both UACR (P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) and microalbuminuria (P = 0.001). We observed similar associations among 6981 African Americans in the CARe Consortium. The associations between this variant and both UACR and microalbuminuria were significant in individuals of European ancestry regardless of diabetes status. Finally, this variant associated with a 41% increased risk for the development of persistent microalbuminuria during 20 years of follow-up among 1304 participants with type 1 diabetes in the prospective DCCT/EDIC Study. In summary, we identified a missense CUBN variant that associates with levels of albuminuria in both the general population and in individuals with diabetes.	 17986697 17990981 18366642 18440328 18462017 18579639 18805900 18534731 18974833 19060907 19226709 19118149 19260141 19303062 19357254 19561590 10466767 14025561 15610229 15812145 16032514 16087792 16135132 16320381 16317982 16443770 16514429 16267840 16571882 16845089 16862161 16880179 17037740 17351290 17213467 17372189 17384015 17495987 17550581 17873875 19366958 19369405 19499243 19584900 19876613 19908023 20081858 20124537 20040588 20068286 20383146 19430482 15277282 15492944 1208363 20798259 10588521 10811843 10801388 11230178 11565448 11685557 11731797 11793014 11912263 12356629 12397006 14570951 15121494 15210602 224699 3204420 2646917 1669507 7643540 8793803 9334227 9478979 17873877

21357676	Sequence variants at CYP1A1-CYP1A2 and AHR associate with coffee consumption.	Coffee is the most commonly used stimulant and caffeine is its main psychoactive ingredient. The heritability of coffee consumption has been estimated at around 50%. We performed a meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies of coffee consumption among coffee drinkers from Iceland (n = 2680), The Netherlands (n = 2791), the Sorbs Slavonic population isolate in Germany (n = 771) and the USA (n = 369) using both directly genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (2.5 million SNPs). SNPs at the two most significant loci were also genotyped in a sample set from Iceland (n = 2430) and a Danish sample set consisting of pregnant women (n = 1620). Combining all data, two sequence variants significantly associated with increased coffee consumption: rs2472297-T located between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 at 15q24 (P = 5.4 · 10(-14)) and rs6968865-T near aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) at 7p21 (P = 2.3 · 10(-11)). An effect of ∼0.2 cups a day per allele was observed for both SNPs. CYP1A2 is the main caffeine metabolizing enzyme and is also involved in drug metabolism. AHR detects xenobiotics, such as polycyclic aryl hydrocarbons found in roasted coffee, and induces transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. The association of these SNPs with coffee consumption was present in both smokers and non-smokers.	 17572673 17135278 18385739 18794855 19088789 19026991 19230121 19049813 19261855 19335181 19469749 19430479 19430483 11117975 11315092 12111919 14517540 6265942 2392895 8604958 8799528 9952310 10233211 10376760 16128905 16255080 17012270 18157525

21408207	Differential genetic associations for systemic lupus erythematosus based on anti-dsDNA autoantibody production.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody formation. Previously published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have investigated SLE as a single phenotype. Therefore, we conducted a GWAS to identify genetic factors associated with anti-dsDNA autoantibody production, a SLE-related autoantibody with diagnostic and clinical importance. Using two independent datasets, over 400,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were studied in a total of 1,717 SLE cases and 4,813 healthy controls. Anti-dsDNA autoantibody positive (anti-dsDNA +, n = 811) and anti-dsDNA autoantibody negative (anti-dsDNA -, n = 906) SLE cases were compared to healthy controls and to each other to identify SNPs associated specifically with these SLE subtypes. SNPs in the previously identified SLE susceptibility loci STAT4, IRF5, ITGAM, and the major histocompatibility complex were strongly associated with anti-dsDNA + SLE. Far fewer and weaker associations were observed for anti-dsDNA - SLE. For example, rs7574865 in STAT4 had an OR for anti-dsDNA + SLE of 1.77 (95% CI 1.57-1.99, p = 2.0E-20) compared to an OR for anti-dsDNA - SLE of 1.26 (95% CI 1.12-1.41, p = 2.4E-04), with p(heterogeneity)<0.0005. SNPs in the SLE susceptibility loci BANK1, KIAA1542, and UBE2L3 showed evidence of association with anti-dsDNA + SLE and were not associated with anti-dsDNA - SLE. In conclusion, we identified differential genetic associations with SLE based on anti-dsDNA autoantibody production. Many previously identified SLE susceptibility loci may confer disease risk through their role in autoantibody production and be more accurately described as autoantibody propensity loci. Lack of strong SNP associations may suggest that other types of genetic variation or non-genetic factors such as environmental exposures have a greater impact on susceptibility to anti-dsDNA - SLE.	 11958584 21379322 7138600 7718010 7575721 9324032 16373251 16642019 16572446 16862161 17500073 17529973 17572673 17701901 17804842 17932559 18204446 18204098 18437207 18516230 18560522 18579578 19132087 19851445 19838195 20353580 14561795
21378990	Large-scale association analysis identifies 13 new susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease.	We performed a meta-analysis of 14 genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease (CAD) comprising 22,233 individuals with CAD (cases) and 64,762 controls of European descent followed by genotyping of top association signals in 56,682 additional individuals. This analysis identified 13 loci newly associated with CAD at P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ and confirmed the association of 10 of 12 previously reported CAD loci. The 13 new loci showed risk allele frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.91 and were associated with a 6% to 17% increase in the risk of CAD per allele. Notably, only three of the new loci showed significant association with traditional CAD risk factors and the majority lie in gene regions not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD. Finally, five of the new CAD risk loci appear to have pleiotropic effects, showing strong association with various other human diseases or traits.	 4366052 8127331 9603539 17634449 17624916 18344981 18714375 19060906 19198610 19198611 19474294 19812666 19838192 20031568 20032323 20219748 20463879 20686566 20923989 20971364 21158662

21378988	A genome-wide association study in Europeans and South Asians identifies five new loci for coronary artery disease.	Genome-wide association studies have identified 11 common variants convincingly associated with coronary artery disease (CAD)¹⁻⁷, a modest number considering the apparent heritability of CAD⁸. All of these variants have been discovered in European populations. We report a meta-analysis of four large genome-wide association studies of CAD, with ∼575,000 genotyped SNPs in a discovery dataset comprising 15,420 individuals with CAD (cases) (8,424 Europeans and 6,996 South Asians) and 15,062 controls. There was little evidence for ancestry-specific associations, supporting the use of combined analyses. Replication in an independent sample of 21,408 cases and 19,185 controls identified five loci newly associated with CAD (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ in the combined discovery and replication analysis): LIPA on 10q23, PDGFD on 11q22, ADAMTS7-MORF4L1 on 15q25, a gene rich locus on 7q22 and KIAA1462 on 10p11. The CAD-associated SNP in the PDGFD locus showed tissue-specific cis expression quantitative trait locus effects. These findings implicate new pathways for CAD susceptibility.	 20418890 20562444 16862161 19404752 20123964 19066402 18048406 10447785 19168437 17478679 19028801 16839190 20971364 12270005 19198609 18573494 15266304 19198612 20502693 18539757 18454146 19820697 21088011 21239051 12114036 17478681 18362232 10465168 20488312 17554300 17634449 16238676 20167083 17873874 12176944 19779445
21386085	A bivariate genome-wide approach to metabolic syndrome: STAMPEED consortium.	OBJECTIVE The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as concomitant disorders of lipid and glucose metabolism, central obesity, and high blood pressure, with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study tests whether common genetic variants with pleiotropic effects account for some of the correlated architecture among five metabolic phenotypes that define MetS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Seven studies of the STAMPEED consortium, comprising 22,161 participants of European ancestry, underwent genome-wide association analyses of metabolic traits using a panel of ∼2.5 million imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Phenotypes were defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria for MetS in pairwise combinations. Individuals exceeding the NCEP thresholds for both traits of a pair were considered affected. RESULTS Twenty-nine common variants were associated with MetS or a pair of traits. Variants in the genes LPL, CETP, APOA5 (and its cluster), GCKR (and its cluster), LIPC, TRIB1, LOC100128354/MTNR1B, ABCB11, and LOC100129150 were further tested for their association with individual qualitative and quantitative traits. None of the 16 top SNPs (one per gene) associated simultaneously with more than two individual traits. Of them 11 variants showed nominal associations with MetS per se. The effects of 16 top SNPs on the quantitative traits were relatively small, together explaining from ∼9% of the variance in triglycerides, 5.8% of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 3.6% of fasting glucose, and 1.4% of systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS Qualitative and quantitative pleiotropic tests on pairs of traits indicate that a small portion of the covariation in these traits can be explained by the reported common genetic variants.	 11056092 16603721 11790215 12123765 12145182 12485966 12865761 14693718 15333474 10521376 15528295 15691623 15928243 16172425 16201139 17084253 17071916 17579830 17485573 17768309 18008060 18179892 18193043 18193044 18439548 18507210 18378515 18782016 18603531 19055447 19060906 19060908 19060909 19060910 19060911 19079261 18643775 19101670 19557161 19692490 19643913 19861489 19802338 20081858 19629056 20686565 19430483 21082868 11756317
21423719	Genome-wide association analysis identifies variants associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that have distinct effects on metabolic traits.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) clusters in families, but the only known common genetic variants influencing risk are near PNPLA3. We sought to identify additional genetic variants influencing NAFLD using genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of computed tomography (CT) measured hepatic steatosis, a non-invasive measure of NAFLD, in large population based samples. Using variance components methods, we show that CT hepatic steatosis is heritable (∼26%-27%) in family-based Amish, Family Heart, and Framingham Heart Studies (n = 880 to 3,070). By carrying out a fixed-effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) results between CT hepatic steatosis and ∼2.4 million imputed or genotyped SNPs in 7,176 individuals from the Old Order Amish, Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik study (AGES), Family Heart, and Framingham Heart Studies, we identify variants associated at genome-wide significant levels (p<5×10(-8)) in or near PNPLA3, NCAN, and PPP1R3B. We genotype these and 42 other top CT hepatic steatosis-associated SNPs in 592 subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD from the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN). In comparisons with 1,405 healthy controls from the Myocardial Genetics Consortium (MIGen), we observe significant associations with histologic NAFLD at variants in or near NCAN, GCKR, LYPLAL1, and PNPLA3, but not PPP1R3B. Variants at these five loci exhibit distinct patterns of association with serum lipids, as well as glycemic and anthropometric traits. We identify common genetic variants influencing CT-assessed steatosis and risk of NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis associated variants are not uniformly associated with NASH/fibrosis or result in abnormalities in serum lipids or glycemic and anthropometric traits, suggesting genetic heterogeneity in the pathways influencing these traits.	 20336705 20346437 11059435 11693332 11766883 12198701 14695401 15464659 474565 8651220 9545414 15599315 15618373 15621217 15915461 16336439 16540768 16862161 17372189 17384015 17463246 17701901 18193043 18193044 18208327 18565021 18651836 18940312 18805900 18820647 18804555 19060906 19079260 18931897 19198609 19011112 19224197 19208353 19557161 20581827 20686565 20648472 20081858 19643913 20935630 20034933 20335584 20373368 20470424
21399633	Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for IgA nephropathy.	We carried out a genome-wide association study of IgA nephropathy, a major cause of kidney failure worldwide. We studied 1,194 cases and 902 controls of Chinese Han ancestry, with targeted follow up in Chinese and European cohorts comprising 1,950 cases and 1,920 controls. We identified three independent loci in the major histocompatibility complex, as well as a common deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 at chromosome 1q32 and a locus at chromosome 22q12 that each surpassed genome-wide significance (P values for association between 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ and 4.84 × 10⁻⁹ and minor allele odds ratios of 0.63-0.80). These five loci explain 4-7% of the disease variance and up to a tenfold variation in interindividual risk. Many of the alleles that protect against IgA nephropathy impart increased risk for other autoimmune or infectious diseases, and IgA nephropathy risk allele frequencies closely parallel the variation in disease prevalence among Asian, European and African populations, suggesting complex selective pressures.	 19812545 18971310 20581873 20639878 20694011 19037255 19349983 19384873 19288169 19525961 19528535 19531670 19851445 19851446 19915574 19950302 20694013 20386929 20595679 20634323 20056855 11062479 11179016 12753320 12883005 15327376 15488952 3329736 8325028 8157744 10393701 15930092 16415888 16531983 16936732 16998489 16998491 17186473 17483596 17367211 17342176 17554300 17548524 17634434 17701901 17924348 17986697 18252895 18272841 20360734
21399635	Genome-wide association study identifies 12 new susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis.	In addition to the HLA locus, six genetic risk factors for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) have been identified in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To identify additional loci, we carried out a GWAS using 1,840 cases from the UK PBC Consortium and 5,163 UK population controls as part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3). We followed up 28 loci in an additional UK cohort of 620 PBC cases and 2,514 population controls. We identified 12 new susceptibility loci (at a genome-wide significance level of P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) and replicated all previously associated loci. We identified three further new loci in a meta-analysis of data from our study and previously published GWAS results. New candidate genes include STAT4, DENND1B, CD80, IL7R, CXCR5, TNFRSF1A, CLEC16A and NFKB1. This study has considerably expanded our knowledge of the genetic architecture of PBC.	 12003998 20579762 12360211 12563297 15007167 1374453 10190721 10421645 16177252 16175622 16862161 16941709 17701901 17873877 17641080 19092835 18600481 19200528 19458352 19464896 19557189 19915572 20032318 20509871 20507892 20639879 20639880
21437268	A genome-wide association study of upper aerodigestive tract cancers conducted within the INHANCE consortium.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying common genetic variation involved in susceptibility to etiologically complex disease. We conducted a GWAS to identify common genetic variation involved in susceptibility to upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) cancers. Genome-wide genotyping was carried out using the Illumina HumanHap300 beadchips in 2,091 UADT cancer cases and 3,513 controls from two large European multi-centre UADT cancer studies, as well as 4,821 generic controls. The 19 top-ranked variants were investigated further in an additional 6,514 UADT cancer cases and 7,892 controls of European descent from an additional 13 UADT cancer studies participating in the INHANCE consortium. Five common variants presented evidence for significant association in the combined analysis (p ≤ 5 × 10⁻⁷). Two novel variants were identified, a 4q21 variant (rs1494961, p = 1×10⁻⁸) located near DNA repair related genes HEL308 and FAM175A (or Abraxas) and a 12q24 variant (rs4767364, p =2 × 10⁻⁸) located in an extended linkage disequilibrium region that contains multiple genes including the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene. Three remaining variants are located in the ADH gene cluster and were identified previously in a candidate gene study involving some of these samples. The association between these three variants and UADT cancers was independently replicated in 5,092 UADT cancer cases and 6,794 controls non-overlapping samples presented here (rs1573496-ADH7, p = 5 × 10⁻⁸); rs1229984-ADH1B, p = 7 × 10⁻⁹; and rs698-ADH1C, p = 0.02). These results implicate two variants at 4q21 and 12q24 and further highlight three ADH variants in UADT cancer susceptibility.	 12794064 11751861 14652239 14693654 15286464 6582480 3236394 2024727 7932824 7703800 15297300 16103445 16685648 16792555 16862161 17505073 17525340 17554300 17517688 17701901 18076043 18281249 18385738 18385739 18385676 17923853 18500343 18596976 18978790 18978792 18830131 18814262 19064644 18996923 19320537 19396169 19140131 19565500 19442571 19687126 19820697 19862010 20139978 20233392 19776245 20383146 19430480 12930761
21424380	Potential novel candidate polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association study for breast cancer susceptibility.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown several risk alleles to be associated with breast cancer. However, the variants identified so far contribute to only a small proportion of disease risk. The objective of our GWAS was to identify additional novel breast cancer susceptibility variants and to replicate these findings in an independent cohort. We performed a two-stage association study in a cohort of 3,064 women from Alberta, Canada. In Stage I, we interrogated 906,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays using 348 breast cancer cases and 348 controls. We used single-locus association tests to determine statistical significance for the observed differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In Stage II, we attempted to replicate 35 significant markers identified in Stage I in an independent study of 1,153 cases and 1,215 controls. Genotyping of Stage II samples was done using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY iPlex platform. Six loci from four different gene regions (chromosomes 4, 5, 16 and 19) showed statistically significant differences between cases and controls in both Stage I and Stage II testing, and also in joint analysis. The identified variants were from EDNRA, ROPN1L, C16orf61 and ZNF577 gene regions. The presented joint analyses from the two-stage study design were not significant after genome-wide correction. The SNPs identified in this study may serve as potential candidate loci for breast cancer risk in a further replication study in Stage III from Alberta population or independent validation in Caucasian cohorts elsewhere.	 11073813 20562875 11984562 14660588 15041798 2270482 8524414 15496401 16415888 16575876 16832357 16862161 16998505 17200668 17389914 17529973 17529974 17529967 17903305 17725844 18326623 17659439 18483326 18438407 18579814 19170031 19028704 19219042 19330027 19330030 20453838 20562874 11967536
21418511	Genome-wide association study identifies a single major locus contributing to survival into old age; the APOE locus revisited.	By studying the loci that contribute to human longevity, we aim to identify mechanisms that contribute to healthy aging. To identify such loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comparing 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-living families included in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and 1670 younger population controls. The strongest candidate SNPs from this GWAS have been analyzed in a meta-analysis of nonagenarian cases from the Rotterdam Study, Leiden 85-plus study, and Danish 1905 cohort. Only one of the 62 prioritized SNPs from the GWAS analysis (P<1×10(-4) ) showed genome-wide significance with survival into old age in the meta-analysis of 4149 nonagenarian cases and 7582 younger controls [OR=0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.77), P=3.39 × 10(-17) ]. This SNP, rs2075650, is located in TOMM40 at chromosome 19q13.32 close to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Although there was only moderate linkage disequilibrium between rs2075650 and the ApoE ε4 defining SNP rs429358, we could not find an APOE-independent effect of rs2075650 on longevity, either in cross-sectional or in longitudinal analyses. As expected, rs429358 associated with metabolic phenotypes in the offspring of the nonagenarian cases from the LLS and their partners. In addition, we observed a novel association between this locus and serum levels of IGF-1 in women (P=0.005). In conclusion, the major locus determining familial longevity up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by rs2075650, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE ε4 allele. No other major longevity locus was found.	 16671834 15022210 15461798 4337382 3337104 8421977 17192785 18765803 19020537 19060911 19196970 19065144 19489743 19578179 19734902 19734903 19682117 19951432 20157552 20074603 20018826 20336132 20304771 20395504 20398121 20460622 20100581 20824210 20921414 17194192 17701901 17702883 18268168 18197199 18316725 18086568 18348202 18439552 18711139 20849521 20849522 21070591 20811950 11015124 11039573 11083328 11524377 11526246 12004104 12507676 12914749 14511155 14624729 14728640 8346443 8136829 8163645 9334291 9343498 9678314 15771611 16251894 16463022 16611701 16708071

21423239	A genome-wide association study of attempted suicide.	The heritable component to attempted and completed suicide is partly related to psychiatric disorders and also partly independent of them. Although attempted suicide linkage regions have been identified on 2p11-12 and 6q25-26, there are likely many more such loci, the discovery of which will require a much higher resolution approach, such as the genome-wide association study (GWAS). With this in mind, we conducted an attempted suicide GWAS that compared the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of 1201 bipolar (BP) subjects with a history of suicide attempts to the genotypes of 1497 BP subjects without a history of suicide attempts. In all, 2507 SNPs with evidence for association at P<0.001 were identified. These associated SNPs were subsequently tested for association in a large and independent BP sample set. None of these SNPs were significantly associated in the replication sample after correcting for multiple testing, but the combined analysis of the two sample sets produced an association signal on 2p25 (rs300774) at the threshold of genome-wide significance (P=5.07 × 10(-8)). The associated SNPs on 2p25 fall in a large linkage disequilibrium block containing the ACP1 (acid phosphatase 1) gene, a gene whose expression is significantly elevated in BP subjects who have completed suicide. Furthermore, the ACP1 protein is a tyrosine phosphatase that influences Wnt signaling, a pathway regulated by lithium, making ACP1 a functional candidate for involvement in the phenotype. Larger GWAS sample sets will be required to confirm the signal on 2p25 and to identify additional genetic risk factors increasing susceptibility for attempted suicide.	 10771491 19571809 12215079 12438242 12676565 12900312 12942141 15166638 15274040 971028 7944874 7982859 9184304 9723140 15648081 16020171 19668376 19715440 19754466 19698782 20081856 20148862 18779820 16389195 16402137 16862161 17046723 17353912 17701901 17728421 17997842 18068248 17968353 18300295 18439443 18439448 18505598 18711365 19200528 19002379 19373277 19376453 19488044 11699804
21396408	Atopy history and the genomics of wheezing after influenza vaccination in children 6-59 months of age.

21441570	Genome-wide meta-analysis for severe diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness. The purpose of this study is to identify novel genetic loci associated with the sight threatening complications of diabetic retinopathy. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data for severe diabetic retinopathy as defined by diabetic macular edema or proliferative diabetic retinopathy in unrelated cases ascertained from two large, type I diabetic cohorts: the Genetics of Kidney in Diabetes (GoKinD) and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Control Trial (EDIC) studies. Controls were other diabetic subjects in the cohort. A combined total of 2829 subjects (973 cases, 1856 controls) were studied on 2 543 887 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Subjects with nephropathy were excluded in a sub-analysis of 281 severe retinopathy cases. We also performed an association analysis of 1390 copy number variations (CNVs) using tag SNPs. No associations were significant at a genome-wide level after correcting for multiple measures. The meta-analysis did identify several associations that can be pursued in future replication studies, including an intergenic SNP, rs476141, on chromosome 1 (P-value 1.2 × 10(-7)). The most interesting signal from the CNV analysis came from the sub-group analysis without nephropathy subjects and is rs10521145 (P-value 3.4 × 10(-6)) in the intron of CCDC101, a histone acetyltransferase. This SNP tags the copy number region CNVR6685.1 on chromosome 16 at 28.5 Mb, a gain/loss site. In summary, this study nominates several novel genetic loci associated with the sight-threatening complications of diabetic retinopathy and anticipates future large-scale consortium-based validation studies.	 20658514 15855583 11322783 12724690 15078674 345173 7196564 6759208 6367725 6709313 2856982 2866759 8366922 7789640 9356033 9440091 19430480 17357068 17513698 18398418 18348202 18443200 18765632 18776909 18846210 19054495 19474294 19915574 19933162 19812545 20360734 20598280
21441931	Common variation in GPC5 is associated with acquired nephrotic syndrome.	Severe proteinuria is a defining factor of nephrotic syndrome irrespective of the etiology. Investigation of congenital nephrotic syndrome has shown that dysfunction of glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) plays a crucial role in this disease. Acquired nephrotic syndrome is also assumed to be associated with podocyte injury. Here we identify an association between variants in GPC5, encoding glypican-5, and acquired nephrotic syndrome through a genome-wide association study and replication analysis (P value under a recessive model (P(rec)) = 6.0 × 10(-11), odds ratio = 2.54). We show that GPC5 is expressed in podocytes and that the risk genotype is associated with higher expression. We further show that podocyte-specific knockdown and systemic short interfering RNA injection confers resistance to podocyte injury in mouse models of nephrosis. This study identifies GPC5 as a new susceptibility gene for nephrotic syndrome and implicates GPC5 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing podocyte vulnerability in glomerular disease.	 12506137 18782013 20688934 11501945 10978394 20977637 10460507 11940521 11729249 15625073 17359929 8675651 10872465 15798086 19715440 8544400 8441244 18318435 11292377 19266252 10742089 16932440 20647424 8521464 18505598 14744114 12138133 9065409 19374006 18794856 15146236 18711366 20085713 9502567 17689694 9070915 3323599 8609172 17210683 16258373
21448238	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association for migraine in six population-based European cohorts.	Migraine is a common neurological disorder with a genetically complex background. This paper describes a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) studies on migraine, performed by the Dutch-Icelandic migraine genetics (DICE) consortium, which brings together six population-based European migraine cohorts with a total sample size of 10,980 individuals (2446 cases and 8534 controls). A total of 32 SNPs showed marginal evidence for association at a P-value<10(-5). The best result was obtained for SNP rs9908234, which had a P-value of 8.00 × 10(-8). This top SNP is located in the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) gene. However, this SNP did not replicate in three cohorts from the Netherlands and Australia. Of the other 31 SNPs, 18 SNPs were tested in two replication cohorts, but none replicated. In addition, we explored previously identified candidate genes in the meta-analysis data set. This revealed a modest gene-based significant association between migraine and the metadherin (MTDH) gene, previously identified in the first clinic-based GWA study (GWAS) for migraine (Bonferroni-corrected gene-based P-value=0.026). This finding is consistent with the involvement of the glutamate pathway in migraine. Additional research is necessary to further confirm the involvement of glutamate.	 9546526 19819557 16054936 16080125 15953655 16361951 16365871 16611468 16773568 17116097 17095019 17254420 10765051 20303062 19925624 20598278 20802479 19673907 21058334 11085595 11554907 11735220 11836652 10967305 12047331 12539047 14513409 14718719 14979299 15022209 8098663 8792035 8898206 16698126 17495624 17572673 17635597 17955331 18300295 18256235 18423523 18672474 18763692 18361423 18676988 18852200 19093296 19089453 19253056 19219470 19549973 19426123 17714520 19455354 19924298 20071666 10449117
21483845	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic loci associated with iron deficiency.	The existence of multiple inherited disorders of iron metabolism in man, rodents and other vertebrates suggests genetic contributions to iron deficiency. To identify new genomic locations associated with iron deficiency, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA collected from white men aged≥25 y and women≥50 y in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study with serum ferritin (SF)≤12 µg/L (cases) and iron replete controls (SF>100 µg/L in men, SF>50 µg/L in women). Regression analysis was used to examine the association between case-control status (336 cases, 343 controls) and quantitative serum iron measures and 331,060 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, with replication analyses performed in a sample of 71 cases and 161 controls from a population of white male and female veterans screened at a US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center. Five SNPs identified in the GWAS met genome-wide statistical significance for association with at least one iron measure, rs2698530 on chr. 2p14; rs3811647 on chr. 3q22, a known SNP in the transferrin (TF) gene region; rs1800562 on chr. 6p22, the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene; rs7787204 on chr. 7p21; and rs987710 on chr. 22q11 (GWAS observed P<1.51×10(-7) for all). An association between total iron binding capacity and SNP rs3811647 in the TF gene (GWAS observed P=7.0×10(-9), corrected P=0.012) was replicated within the VA samples (observed P=0.012). Associations with the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene also were replicated. The joint analysis of the HEIRS and VA samples revealed strong associations between rs2698530 on chr. 2p14 and iron status outcomes. These results confirm a previously-described TF polymorphism and implicate one potential new locus as a target for gene identification.	 17729390 19673882 19820699 19304112 17384015 10739755 16565477 17206377 11703331 20095037 7602240 19084217 19907145 18596229 8943161 17511979 12907432 19252488 14648375 18603562 3529940 12752114 24197326 21058334 11207374 19880490 9836708 7636385 19528880 18408718 10193442 12589228 15858186 17847004 6851680 19338078 443198 19252486 11500065 19820698 10660486 12521995 12614226

We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci contributing to sporadic DCM.	 20215591 20124441 20502693 19730248 20532800 20634204 20827270 20975947 20884878 21248228 10529327 10593960 10636255 12202775 12820654 14560401 2766509 1534257 10099905 16251469 16228001 16814656 16936253 17308338 17634449 17652939 17916581 18256235 18276640 18621691 19085932 19184112 19229298 19708444 19525294 19845507 20189027 20060297 20038796 20201937 20364137
21460395	A genome-wide association study identifies a locus on chromosome 14q21 as a predictor of leukocyte telomere length and as a marker of susceptibility for bladder cancer.	Telomeres play a critical role in maintaining genome integrity. Telomere shortening is associated with the risk of many aging-related diseases. Classic twin studies have shown that genetic components may contribute up to 80% of the heritability of telomere length. In the study we report here that we used a multistage genome-wide association study to identify genetic determinants of telomere length. The mean telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. We first analyzed 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 459 healthy controls, finding 15,120 SNPs associated with telomere length at P < 0.05. We then validated these SNPs in two independent populations comprising 890 and 270 healthy controls, respectively. Four SNPs, including rs398652 on 14q21, were associated with telomere length across all three populations (pooled P values of <10(-5)). The variant alleles of these SNPs were associated with longer telomere length. We then analyzed the association of these SNPs with the risk of bladder cancer in a large case-control study. The variant allele of rs398652 was associated with a significantly reduced risk of bladder cancer (odds ratio = 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.97; P = 0.025), consistent with the correlation of this variant allele with longer telomeres. We then conducted a mediation analysis to examine whether the association between rs398652 and reduced bladder cancer risk is mediated by telomere length, finding that telomere length was a significant mediator of the relationship between rs398652 and bladder cancer (P = 0.013), explaining 14% of the effect. In conclusion, we found that the SNP rs398652 on 14q21 was associated with longer telomere length and a reduced risk of bladder cancer and that a portion of the effect of this SNP on bladder cancer risk was mediated by telomere length.	 12000852 11902575 12370331 12735903 12860405 12928346 6330571 3806354 2541342 7977349 8733138 9467848 15520935 15574496 15680963 16400618 16440201 16804004 17024208 17416776 17707063 17874998 18086770 18385676 18487243 18978787 19047128 19022706 18945604 19151717 19240244 18820651 19543373 19359265 19578363 19578367 19648920 19405848 19784860 19892797 20101243 20139977 20478107 20421499 20606151 20564069 20956286 21131975 21195167 12114022 15746160 16112303 16136653 10948077 11121233 11322993
21460840	Common variants at ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP are associated with Alzheimer's disease.	We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci reported by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) in a companion paper. We undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated variants with P ≤ 1 × 10(-5). We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7 (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 × 10(-17); including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 × 10(-21)) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 × 10(-14); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 × 10(-16)) are new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 × 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 8.6 × 10(-9)), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 × 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 × 10(-9)) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 × 10(-4); including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 × 10(-10)).	 17553421 20570404 17982457 11486273 11519828 12672817 6610841 2970642 2011243 8350998 9741631 15550377 16111551 16461860 16738483 16362079 16801213 16908670 17380156 17973979 18348202 18802966 18976728 19118217 19497733 19734902 19734903 20042704 20354512 20460622 20485568 20558387 20534741 20558149 20554627 20697030 21460841 17562860
21460842	A genome-wide association study identifies three loci associated with susceptibility to uterine fibroids.	Uterine fibroids are a common benign tumor of the female genital tract. We conducted a genome-wide association study in which 457,044 SNPs were analyzed in 1,607 individuals with clinically diagnosed uterine fibroids and 1,428 female controls. SNPs showing suggestive associations (P < 5 × 10(-5)) were further genotyped in 3,466 additional cases and 3,245 female controls. Three loci on chromosomes 10q24.33, 22q13.1 and 11p15.5 revealed genome-wide significant associations with uterine fibroids. The SNPs showing the most significant association in a combination analysis at each of these loci were rs7913069 (P = 8.65 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR) = 1.47), rs12484776 (P = 2.79 × 10(-12), OR = 1.23) and rs2280543 (P = 3.82 × 10(-12), OR = 1.39), respectively. Subsequent fine mapping of these regions will be necessary to pinpoint the causal variants. Our findings should shed light on the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids.	 17765232 11501945 20178534 12826476 12388752 15052621 8793374 20414841 18951332 18382658 1442963 8635633 20129246 17289997 11870087 18541531 11214143 7026295 19222302 12095482 20421499 16289642 14685227 9757957

21471458	Genome-wide association and genetic functional studies identify autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2) in the regulation of alcohol consumption.	Alcohol consumption is a moderately heritable trait, but the genetic basis in humans is largely unknown, despite its clinical and societal importance. We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of ∼2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed SNPs with alcohol consumption (gram per day per kilogram body weight) among 12 population-based samples of European ancestry, comprising 26,316 individuals, with replication genotyping in an additional 21,185 individuals. SNP rs6943555 in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2) was associated with alcohol consumption at genome-wide significance (P = 4 × 10(-8) to P = 4 × 10(-9)). We found a genotype-specific expression of AUTS2 in 96 human prefrontal cortex samples (P = 0.026) and significant (P < 0.017) differences in expression of AUTS2 in whole-brain extracts of mice selected for differences in voluntary alcohol consumption. Down-regulation of an AUTS2 homolog caused reduced alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila (P < 0.001). Our finding of a regulator of alcohol consumption adds knowledge to our understanding of genetic mechanisms influencing alcohol drinking behavior.	 11315092 12160723 12593794 3307505 2904004 15597076 15995696 16618939 17211639 17572673 17625558 17718394 17935575 18519825 18446784 18477577 19342616 19464045 19543373 19560604 19389183 19581569 19710631 19948250 20194547 20202923 19546859 20201924 20648632 21058334 21055420 20727682
21471979	Common variants on 14q32 and 13q12 are associated with DLBCL susceptibility.	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most aggressive cancers of B-lymphocytes. To investigate genetic susceptibility factors for DLBCL, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism based genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a total of 399 DLBCL cases and 4243 controls of Japanese population. By following two-stage GWAS approach and an independent replication study, we identified disease susceptibility locus within intron 3 of the CDC42BPB gene on 14q32 (rs751837; P=3.30 × 10(-7) and odds ratio (OR) of 3.5), a region of frequent chromosomal translocations in lymphoma, and variant on 13q12 (rs7097; P=6.57 × 10(-6) and OR of 1.43) which harbors the notch signaling mediator, LNX2 gene. Our findings would contribute to the understanding of DLBCL risk and also may lead to the elucidation of its molecular pathogenesis.	
21490707	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies regions on 7p21 (AHR) and 15q24 (CYP1A2) as determinants of habitual caffeine consumption.	We report the first genome-wide association study of habitual caffeine intake. We included 47,341 individuals of European descent based on five population-based studies within the United States. In a meta-analysis adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and eigenvectors of population variation, two loci achieved genome-wide significance: 7p21 (P = 2.4 × 10(-19)), near AHR, and 15q24 (P = 5.2 × 10(-14)), between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. Both the AHR and CYP1A2 genes are biologically plausible candidates as CYP1A2 metabolizes caffeine and AHR regulates CYP1A2.	 17786212 18070814 18348202 18088379 18466106 18619574 19808636 19802894 20022913 20233392 19961320 20418890 20562874 20598278 20532872 20520601 10592173 10933275 11207026 11744511 12213390 12540743 4014201 8320406 9262401 10049999 15635355 15965471 16185212 16507475 16505155 17616786 17572673
21490949	Transferability of type 2 diabetes implicated loci in multi-ethnic cohorts from Southeast Asia.	Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci which harbor genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), many of which encode proteins not previously suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. Most GWAS for T2D have focused on populations of European descent, and GWAS conducted in other populations with different ancestry offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of T2D. We performed genome-wide association scans for T2D in 3,955 Chinese (2,010 cases, 1,945 controls), 2,034 Malays (794 cases, 1,240 controls), and 2,146 Asian Indians (977 cases, 1,169 controls). In addition to the search for novel variants implicated in T2D, these multi-ethnic cohorts serve to assess the transferability and relevance of the previous findings from European descent populations in the three major ethnic populations of Asia, comprising half of the world's population. Of the SNPs associated with T2D in previous GWAS, only variants at CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 showed the strongest association with T2D in the meta-analysis including all three ethnic groups. However, consistent direction of effect was observed for many of the other SNPs in our study and in those carried out in European populations. Close examination of the associations at both the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci provided some evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to the associations with T2D. We also detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for most of these loci that have been previously identified. These factors, combined with limited statistical power, may contribute to the failure to detect associations across populations of diverse ethnicity. These findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups towards the fine-mapping efforts for the casual variants and also of the search for variants, which may be population-specific.	 17603484 17665514 17671651 17697858 17943122 17928989 17827400 17971426 18040659 18162508 18231124 18372903 18437351 18469204 18477659 18597214 18633108 18766326 18991055 18711367 18711366 19033397 19247373 19252135 19470990 19308350 19448982 19543373 19401414 19502545 19455301 19556355 19541915 19862325 19651812 19700652 19995197 19670153 19892838 19875164 20161779 20174558 20335585 20308177 20512086 20581827 20550665 20509872 10973253 11693972 12540637 15115830 2348145 9328546 10333940 16415884 16862161 16936215 17293876 17365815 17463246 17463248 17463249 17554300 17572673
21473668	Genome-wide association study of motor coordination problems in ADHD identifies genes for brain and muscle function.	Motor coordination problems are frequent in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

21478494	Genome-wide association study identifies nidogen 1 (NID1) as a susceptibility locus to cutaneous nevi and melanoma risk.	We conducted a genome-wide association study on the number of melanocytic nevi reported by 9136 individuals of European ancestry, with follow-up replication in 3581 individuals. We identified the nidogen 1 (NID1) gene on 1q42 associated with nevus count (two linked single nucleotide polymorphisms with r(2) > 0.9: rs3768080 A allele associated with reduced count, P = 6.5 × 10(-8); and rs10754833 T allele associated with reduced count, P = 1.5 × 10(-7)). We further determined that the rs10754833 [T] was associated with a decreased melanoma risk in 2368 melanoma cases and 7432 controls [for CT genotype: odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-0.99, P = 0.04; for TT genotype: OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.71-0.98, P = 0.03]. Expression level of the NID1 locus was 2-fold higher for the rs10754833 T allele carriers than that with the CC genotype (P = 0.017) in the 87 HapMap CEU cell lines. The NID1 gene is a biologically plausible locus for nevogenesis and melanoma development, with decreased expression levels of NID1 in benign nevi (P = 3.5 × 10(-6)) and in primary melanoma (P = 4.6 × 10(-4)) compared with the normal skin.	 11227927 11115171 12894244 3977193 2733040 7719184 15617989 15837981 16243793 16415888 16862161 17063143 17537913 17571346 17529973 19333614 19578365 10625176 10716963 12824369

21483430	Impact of DISC1 variation on neuroanatomical and neurocognitive phenotypes.	Although disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) has been implicated in many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder and major depression, its biological role in these disorders is unclear. To better understand this gene and its role in psychiatric disease, we conducted transcriptional profiling and genome-wide association analysis in 1232 pedigreed Mexican-American individuals for whom we have neuroanatomic images, neurocognitive assessments and neuropsychiatric diagnoses. SOLAR was used to determine heritability, identify gene expression patterns and perform association analyses on 188 quantitative brain-related phenotypes. We found that the DISC1 transcript is highly heritable (h(2)=0.50; P=1.97 × 10(-22)), and that gene expression is strongly cis-regulated (cis-LOD=3.89) but is also influenced by trans-effects. We identified several DISC1 polymorphisms that were associated with cortical gray matter thickness within the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes.

21533175	Eight common genetic variants associated with serum DHEAS levels suggest a key role in ageing mechanisms.	Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) is the most abundant circulating steroid secreted by adrenal glands--yet its function is unknown. Its serum concentration declines significantly with increasing age, which has led to speculation that a relative DHEAS deficiency may contribute to the development of common age-related diseases or diminished longevity. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data with 14,846 individuals and identified eight independent common SNPs associated with serum DHEAS concentrations. Genes at or near the identified loci include ZKSCAN5 (rs11761528; p = 3.15 × 10(-36)), SULT2A1 (rs2637125; p =  2.61 × 10(-19)), ARPC1A (rs740160; p =  1.56 × 10(-16)), TRIM4 (rs17277546; p =  4.50 × 10(-11)), BMF (rs7181230; p = 5.44 × 10(-11)), HHEX (rs2497306; p =  4.64 × 10(-9)), BCL2L11 (rs6738028; p = 1.72 × 10(-8)), and CYP2C9 (rs2185570; p = 2.29 × 10(-8)). These genes are associated with type 2 diabetes, lymphoma, actin filament assembly, drug and xenobiotic metabolism, and zinc finger proteins. Several SNPs were associated with changes in gene expression levels, and the related genes are connected to biological pathways linking DHEAS with ageing. This study provides much needed insight into the function of DHEAS.	 9266846 21304890 10353305 15717807 10580744 10585779 11155097 11159811 11315092 11427700 11474479 11836304 11853289 12128283 12522149 12689998 12899651 14618446 14967152 8597468 9034160 9059564 9230079 14977864 3160911 2946952 2967419 1838082 8126125 8003845 7962319 7657482 8578930 8597464 15985487 17293876 17366318 17463246 17463248 17463249 17572673 17521389 18372903 18462017 18445661 18758461 18703563 19300499 19336552 18439591 19401414 19581420 19578179 19713299 20164211 20414817 20581827 20466773 20714348 20610590 9875107
21499250	Genome-wide association study identifies a common variant associated with risk of endometrial cancer.	Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries. To identify genetic variants associated with endometrial cancer risk, we performed a genome-wide association study involving 1,265 individuals with endometrial cancer (cases) from Australia and the UK and 5,190 controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We compared genotype frequencies in cases and controls for 519,655 SNPs. Forty seven SNPs that showed evidence of association with endometrial cancer in stage 1 were genotyped in 3,957 additional cases and 6,886 controls. We identified an endometrial cancer susceptibility locus close to HNF1B at 17q12 (rs4430796, P = 7.1 × 10(-10)) that is also associated with risk of prostate cancer and is inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.	 17846035 17603485 18637486 18536653 19124504 19058180 19320191 19337055 19715440 19760597 19767754 19889212 20233392 19998368 20453838 20526366 20479278 20581827 20617168 20569440 20656522 20846065 20633866 20981092 20690139 20937645 11592544 12958120 14633622 7900999 7932824 8781735 9754648 15297300 16258507 16862161 16885385 17483596 17503391 17384015 17554300 18264096
21499248	Genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.	To identify the genetic susceptibility factor(s) for hepatitis C virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-induced HCC), we conducted a genome-wide association study using 432,703 autosomal SNPs in 721 individuals with HCV-induced HCC (cases) and 2,890 HCV-negative controls of Japanese origin. Eight SNPs that showed possible association (P < 1 × 10(-5)) in the genome-wide association study were further genotyped in 673 cases and 2,596 controls. We found a previously unidentified locus in the 5' flanking region of MICA on 6p21.33 (rs2596542, P(combined) = 4.21 × 10(-13), odds ratio = 1.39) to be strongly associated with HCV-induced HCC. Subsequent analyses using individuals with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) indicated that this SNP is not associated with CHC susceptibility (P = 0.61) but is significantly associated with progression from CHC to HCC (P = 3.13 × 10(-8)). We also found that the risk allele of rs2596542 was associated with lower soluble MICA protein levels in individuals with HCV-induced HCC (P = 1.38 × 10(-13)).	 17873877 17982410 19409091 12569559 10553908 19759533 17943122 17465466 11224526 9174136 12370336 14768001 19546545 15761078 3329634 19349983 14681338 20169624 19749757 7514558 8176367 15297300 14662896 20060832 18817904 17463248 16168521 16998491 8901601 12384702 17701901 10359807 10426993 16845089 18676862 19684573 1663293 18754878 19148802
21502966	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HLA- and non-HLA genes associated with the development of antibodies to interferon-β therapy in multiple sclerosis patients.	Interferons-β (IFN-β) are the most widely used immunomodulatory drugs for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of neutralizing antibodies (NABs) against IFN-β is one of the main reasons for treatment failure. While formulation of the drug has a proven impact on the development of NABs, the genetic predisposition to develop antibodies is poorly understood. We performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping in 362 MS patients of whom 178 had developed and 184 had not developed antibodies on IFN-β therapy. Four candidate SNPs were validated in an independent cohort of 350 antibody-positive and 468 antibody-negative MS patients. One SNP within the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs9272105, P-value: 3.56 × 10⁻¹⁰) and one SNP in an intergenic region on chromosome 8q24.3 (rs4961252, P-value: 2.92 × 10⁻⁸ showed a genome-wide significant association with the anti-IFN-β antibody titers. We found no interaction between the genome-wide significant SNPs (rs9272105 and rs4961252) in our study and the previously described HLA-DR*0401 or *0408 alleles, indicating an additive effect of SNPs and HLA alleles. Testing for these SNPs and the HLA-DR*0401 or *0408 alleles allows to identify patients at risk to develop antibodies to IFN-β and may provide helpful information for individual treatment decisions.	
21505073	The human AIRE gene at chromosome 21q22 is a genetic determinant for the predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis in Japanese population.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a typical complex trait and the major cause of chronic inflammation worldwide. Although multiple genetic loci have been shown for their association with the onset of RA, they cover only a part of its genetic components and are largely ethnicity-specific. To identify novel genetic factors related to the predisposition and prognosis of RA in Japanese, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) study. We performed a GWA analysis by scanning the genome of 1247 RA cases and 1486 controls for 277 420 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by replication analysis using two independent sample sets consisting of 1865 cases and 1623 controls, and 2303 cases and 3380 controls. We identified two SNPs, rs2075876 and rs760426, in intron of the autoimmune regulator AIRE gene at chromosome 21q22 that showed strong associations with the disease (P= 3.6 × 10(-9) and P= 4.4 × 10(-8), respectively). Rs1800250, in exon7 of AIRE, was in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2)= 0.94) with rs2075876 and introduced an amino acid alteration (S278R) in the SAND domain of the AIRE protein. In silico analysis showed the decreased transcription of AIRE by the risk allele of rs2075876 compared with the alternative allele (P= 6.8 × 10(-5)). No correlation was observed between the rs2075876 genotype and quantitative traits reflecting the progression of RA. As AIRE is a key molecule which regulates the expression and presentation of self-antigens in thymic negative selection, its downregulation by genetic polymorphisms may result in the survival of auto-reactive T cells to trigger auto-inflammation in RA.	
21502949	Discovery and replication of dopamine-related gene effects on caudate volume in young and elderly populations (N=1198) using genome-wide search.	The caudate is a subcortical brain structure implicated in many common neurological and psychiatric disorders. To identify specific genes associated with variations in caudate volume, structural magnetic resonance imaging and genome-wide genotypes were acquired from two large cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI; N=734) and the Brisbane Adolescent/Young Adult Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS; N=464). In a preliminary analysis of heritability, around 90% of the variation in caudate volume was due to genetic factors. We then conducted genome-wide association to find common variants that contribute to this relatively high heritability. Replicated genetic association was found for the right caudate volume at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs163030 in the ADNI discovery sample (P=2.36 × 10⁻⁶) and in the BLTS replication sample (P=0.012). This genetic variation accounted for 2.79 and 1.61% of the trait variance, respectively. The peak of association was found in and around two genes, WDR41 and PDE8B, involved in dopamine signaling and development. In addition, a previously identified mutation in PDE8B causes a rare autosomal-dominant type of striatal degeneration. Searching across both samples offers a rigorous way to screen for genes consistently influencing brain structure at different stages of life. Variants identified here may be relevant to common disorders affecting the caudate.	 12044360 12126656 12151753 12415317 12668349 12893109 12895443 14597168 15148138 15210883 15247539 15454942 1531910 8316062 8415621 7977887 8670681 8928008 9672901 9751933 15724142 16380716 16883304 17008408 17192785 16930719 17481897 17415783 17509484 17554300 17701901 17495251 17727823 18385116 18657402 18675918 19060906 18992130 19228974 19162198 19369395 19571811 19812666 19829063 19896111 19799774 19786105 19434714 20085714 20197096 20421487 20538376 20171287 20624472 20881960 20162602 19659682 20585324 10618008 10845063 10952114 11072261 10801388 11438811 11532737 11545704 11571328
21505071	A genome-wide association study reveals association between common variants in an intergenic region of 4q25 and high-grade myopia in the Chinese Han population.	High-grade myopia (HM) is highly heritable, and has a high prevalence in the Han Chinese population. We carried out a genome-wide association study involving 102 HM cases suffering from retinal degeneration, and 335 controls who were free from HM and fundus diseases. Significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were replicated in two follow-up studies: stage I involved 2628 independent cases and 9485 controls, and stage II involved a further 263 cases and 586 HM-free controls. The results were combined in a meta-analysis. Cases and controls were drawn from the Chinese Han population. A locus in an intergenic region at 4q25, within MYP11 (4q22-q27, OMIM: 609994), was found to be associated with HM (rs10034228, P(meta) = 7.70 × 10(-13), allelic odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.86). There are no known genes in the region but a number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been located there, one of which (BI480957) has been reported to express in the native human retinal pigment epithelium. In addition, a predicted gene was identified in this region. The gene's predicted protein sequence is highly similar to tubulin, beta 8 and beta-tubulin 4Q. Several previous studies have shown that tubulin plays an important role in eye development. Our result is compatible with a previous linkage study in the Han Chinese population (mapping in MYP11, 4q22-q27), and provides a more accurate locus for HM. Although there is insufficient evidence to indicate that expressed EST and the predicted gene play an important role in developing HM, this region merits further study as a candidate for the disease.

21533074	GWAS of follicular lymphoma reveals allelic heterogeneity at 6p21.32 and suggests shared genetic susceptibility with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of hematological malignancies, of which follicular lymphoma (FL) is a prevalent subtype. A previous genome-wide association study has established a marker, rs10484561 in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on 6p21.32 associated with increased FL risk. Here, in a three-stage genome-wide association study, starting with a genome-wide scan of 379 FL cases and 791 controls followed by validation in 1,049 cases and 5,790 controls, we identified a second independent FL-associated locus on 6p21.32, rs2647012 (OR(combined)  = 0.64, P(combined)  = 2 × 10(-21)) located 962 bp away from rs10484561 (r(2)<0.1 in controls). After mutual adjustment, the associations at the two SNPs remained genome-wide significant (rs2647012:OR(adjusted)  = 0.70, P(adjusted)  =  4 × 10(-12); rs10484561:OR(adjusted)  = 1.64, P(adjusted)  = 5 × 10(-15)). Haplotype and coalescence analyses indicated that rs2647012 arose on an evolutionarily distinct haplotype from that of rs10484561 and tags a novel allele with an opposite (protective) effect on FL risk. Moreover, in a follow-up analysis of the top 6 FL-associated SNPs in 4,449 cases of other NHL subtypes, rs10484561 was associated with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR(combined)  = 1.36, P(combined)  =  1.4 × 10(-7)). Our results reveal the presence of allelic heterogeneity within the HLA class II region influencing FL susceptibility and indicate a possible shared genetic etiology with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings suggest that the HLA class II region plays a complex yet important role in NHL.	 16998491 20639881 17133544 17804836 17873877 17722095 17827388 18179884 10676951 11254454 14718216 15095310 9533758 10331250 10419588 15687363 15767774 15811955 16380915 16389181 16391372 18606306 18852200 18796628 19620980 20047977 20147981 20385791 17018637
21533024	Genome-wide association analysis of soluble ICAM-1 concentration reveals novel associations at the NFKBIK, PNPLA3, RELA, and SH2B3 loci.	Soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) is an endothelium-derived inflammatory marker that has been associated with diverse conditions such as myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, and malaria. Despite evidence for a heritable component to sICAM-1 levels, few genetic loci have been identified so far. To comprehensively address this issue, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of sICAM-1 concentration in 22,435 apparently healthy women from the Women's Genome Health Study. While our results confirm the previously reported associations at the ABO and ICAM1 loci, four novel associations were identified in the vicinity of NFKBIK (rs3136642, P = 5.4 × 10(-9)), PNPLA3 (rs738409, P  =  5.8 × 10(-9)), RELA (rs1049728, P =  2.7 × 10(-16)), and SH2B3 (rs3184504, P =  2.9 × 10(-17)). Two loci, NFKBIB and RELA, are involved in NFKB signaling pathway; PNPLA3 is known for its association with fatty liver disease; and SH3B2 has been associated with a multitude of traits and disease including myocardial infarction. These associations provide insights into the genetic regulation of sICAM-1 levels and implicate these loci in the regulation of endothelial function.	 15789306 20418890 18604267 16862161 17112530 20031568 12939654 19651814 15105499 17943122 7822333 18311140 12070287 19913121 20418888 19430479 20147318 16625213 12176954 18070814 8834767 9439492 17554260 19820697 18940312 19862010 15502096 17118959 17389327 18045607 18820647 15705809 19430483 20585554 20418889 17701901 19578494 18348202 19198610 19571811 20167578 18728122 7542214 19417063

Several bone marrow-derived cell populations may have angiogenic activity, including cells termed endothelial progenitor cells. Decreased numbers of circulating angiogenic cell populations have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. However, few data exist from large, unselected samples, and the genetic determinants of these traits are unclear.	 12810616 18669889 15927972 16775629 12676819 15451799 20142446 15608257 19369228 9020076 19092138 20142453 19002139 19055473 11156872 19198611 17925881 19067770 12615796 14676142 15862416 9603539 474565 16148285 19138170 17493626 18276910 20407620 19622820 16496018 9545414 11283669 11440984 15466656 14680729 12584367 17554300 12490960 15322703 19124561 16267090 19509380 17196460 19060906 17255539 15345590 15860717 19115008 19608753 14819398
21533022	Genome-wide association study using extreme truncate selection identifies novel genes affecting bone mineral density and fracture risk.	Osteoporotic fracture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a major predisposing factor to fracture and is known to be highly heritable. Site-, gender-, and age-specific genetic effects on BMD are thought to be significant, but have largely not been considered in the design of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BMD to date. We report here a GWAS using a novel study design focusing on women of a specific age (postmenopausal women, age 55-85 years), with either extreme high or low hip BMD (age- and gender-adjusted BMD z-scores of +1.5 to +4.0, n = 1055, or -4.0 to -1.5, n = 900), with replication in cohorts of women drawn from the general population (n = 20,898). The study replicates 21 of 26 known BMD-associated genes. Additionally, we report suggestive association of a further six new genetic associations in or around the genes CLCN7, GALNT3, IBSP, LTBP3, RSPO3, and SOX4, with replication in two independent datasets. A novel mouse model with a loss-of-function mutation in GALNT3 is also reported, which has high bone mass, supporting the involvement of this gene in BMD determination. In addition to identifying further genes associated with BMD, this study confirms the efficiency of extreme-truncate selection designs for quantitative trait association studies.	 11090233 11697792 11748333 11790802 11918230 12110410 12369777 12499305 12929944 15133511 3446256 8592936 8992884 9421240 9440393 9477237 15536520 15599692 15961556 18292978 18021006 18455228 18458111 18400942 18445777 18606306 18505373 16234964 16234969 16355283 16823544 16983459 17041604 17086194 16963017 16955217 17652162 18193043 19079262 19249006 19181680 19344874 19396169 19557189 19715440 19700477 19801982 19781675 20096396 20200434 20164292 20375209

Given moderately strong genetic contributions to variation in alcoholism and heaviness of drinking (50% to 60% heritability) with high correlation of genetic influences, we have conducted a quantitative trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) for phenotypes related to alcohol use and dependence.	 17067344 16862161 17378921 17668381 17785532 17924335 17921519 18385739 18385676 18519826 18996923 19369660 19581569 19732865 19576574 19896111 20202923 20147890 20473310 20201924 20562875 20468071 20700436 20935630 17436240 10615721 10762547 11731797 12153842 12499305 15211641 15318113 4851437 376949 7259422 1943097 1640041 8189735 8727242 8947326 8974313 9403910 9603606 15724882 16563205
21552555	A genome-wide association study on obesity and obesity-related traits.	Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci associated with body mass index (BMI), but few studies focused on obesity as a binary trait. Here we report the results of a GWAS and candidate SNP genotyping study of obesity, including extremely obese cases and never overweight controls as well as families segregating extreme obesity and thinness. We first performed a GWAS on 520 cases (BMI>35 kg/m(2)) and 540 control subjects (BMI<25 kg/m(2)), on measures of obesity and obesity-related traits. We subsequently followed up obesity-associated signals by genotyping the top ∼500 SNPs from GWAS in the combined sample of cases, controls and family members totaling 2,256 individuals. For the binary trait of obesity, we found 16 genome-wide significant signals within the FTO gene (strongest signal at rs17817449, P = 2.5 × 10(-12)). We next examined obesity-related quantitative traits (such as total body weight, waist circumference and waist to hip ratio), and detected genome-wide significant signals between waist to hip ratio and NRXN3 (rs11624704, P = 2.67 × 10(-9)), previously associated with body weight and fat distribution. Our study demonstrated how a relatively small sample ascertained through extreme phenotypes can detect genuine associations in a GWAS.	 20421936 20130649 20935629 20935630 20622171 11944992 3712713 16198769 16421348 17237739 17434869 17409192 17668381 17804423 18159244 18193043 18218107 18454148 19079260 19079261 19151714 19557161 19557197 19553259 19658047
21521612	The neuronal transporter gene SLC6A15 confers risk to major depression.	Major depression (MD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of loss in work productivity. A combination of genetic and environmental risk factors probably contributes to MD. We present data from a genome-wide association study revealing a neuron-specific neutral amino acid transporter (SLC6A15) as a susceptibility gene for MD. Risk allele carrier status in humans and chronic stress in mice were associated with a downregulation of the expression of this gene in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of MD. The same polymorphisms also showed associations with alterations in hippocampal volume and neuronal integrity. Thus, decreased SLC6A15 expression, due to genetic or environmental factors, might alter neuronal circuits related to the susceptibility for MD. Our convergent data from human genetics, expression studies, brain imaging, and animal models suggest a pathophysiological mechanism for MD that may be accessible to drug targeting.	 11675510 11811670 11855950 12029063 12091188 12091191 12481981 12499305 12813115 14596810 14985154 15123501 15054401 15514393 900119 6880820 9065971 9089829 13688369 15608248 15297300 15997606 16224025 16208455 16185194 16413879 16540203 16636629 16362079 16300747 16862161 16822851 17157096 17440953 17449187 17571346 17529967 17690258 17873874 17943122 17955331 17931606 17982457 18096163 18349090 18300295 18413589 18473166 19047526 18586274 11097952 11112352 19125106 18484085 19200528 19222302 19065144 19736353 19857931 19107115 20516156 20673876 20125088 21042317
21531791	Chromosome 7p11.2 (EGFR) variation influences glioma risk.	While gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, their etiology is largely unknown. To identify novel risk loci for glioma, we conducted genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of two case-control series from France and Germany (2269 cases and 2500 controls). Pooling these data with previously reported UK and US GWA studies provided data on 4147 glioma cases and 7435 controls genotyped for 424 460 common tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Using these data, we demonstrate two statistically independent associations between glioma and rs11979158 and rs2252586, at 7p11.2 which encompasses the EGFR gene (population-corrected statistics, P(c) = 7.72 × 10(-8) and 2.09 × 10(-8), respectively). Both associations were independent of tumor subtype, and were independent of EGFR amplification, p16INK4a deletion and IDH1 mutation status in tumors; compatible with driver effects of the variants on glioma development. These findings show that variation in 7p11.2 is a determinant of inherited glioma risk.	 17177598 17529973 18076069 18497326 18798534 18772890 19284481 19324552 19356978 19578366 19578367 19636000 19738203 19755387 19805672 20668009 20847058 12177636 15557412 16032513 16032514 16228001 16490960 16862161 17456751 17401363 17636416

21540461	A genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia.	In the current study, we identified 2 genetic markers for susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using a genome-wide analysis. A total of 2744 subjects (671 cases and 2073 controls) were included, with 202 Korean CML patients and 497 control subjects enrolled as a discovery set. Significant findings in the discovery set were validated in a second Korean set of 237 patients and 1000 control subjects and in an additional Canadian cohort of European descent, including 232 patients and 576 control subjects. Analysis revealed significant associations of 2 candidate loci, 6q25.1 and 17p11.1, with CML susceptibility, with the lowest combined P values of 2.4 × 10⁻⁶ and 1.3 × 10⁻¹², respectively. Candidate genes in those regions include RMND1, AKAP12, ZBTB2, and WSB1. The locus 6q25.1 was validated in both Korean and European cohorts, whereas 17p11.1 was validated only in the Korean cohort. These findings suggest that genetic variants of 6q25.1 and 17p11.1 may predispose one to the development of CML.

21551455	A second independent locus within DMRT1 is associated with testicular germ cell tumor susceptibility.	Susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has a significant heritable component, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified association with variants in several genes, including KITLG, SPRY4, BAK1, TERT, DMRT1 and ATF7IP. In our GWAS, we genotyped 349 TGCT cases and 919 controls and replicated top hits in an independent set of 439 cases and 960 controls in an attempt to find novel TGCT susceptibility loci. We identified a second marker (rs7040024) in the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) gene that is independent of the previously described risk allele (rs755383) at this locus. In combined analysis that mutually conditions on both DMRT1 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, TGCT cases had elevated odds of carriage of the rs7040024 major A allele [per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23, 1.78; P = 2.52 × 10(-5)] compared with controls, while the association with rs755383 persisted (per allele OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08, 1.47, P = 0.0036). In similar analyses, the association of rs7040024 among men with seminomatous tumors did not differ from that among men with non-seminomatous tumors. In combination with KITLG, the strongest TGCT susceptibility locus found to date, men with TGCT had greatly elevated odds (OR = 14.1, 95% CI 5.12, 38.6; P = 2.98 × 10(-7)) of being double homozygotes for the risk (major) alleles at DMRT (rs7040024) and KITLG (rs4474514) when compared with men without TGCT. Our findings continue to corroborate that genes influencing male germ cell development and differentiation have emerged as the major players in inherited TGCT susceptibility.	 10658529 17540358 11040213 10801388 11306395 11979442 12752272 12781454 12796635 14734704 15123780 15256440 17701901 18071360 18391515 18403106 18776908 19035442 19237718 19051284 19440348 19483681 19483682 19715440 19819582 20007774 20543847 20562874 20855803 21058334 21464350 8021956 8611416 8647624 9524563 10362123 15619639 16049803 16172230 16284378 16415888 16466541 15298952 1739626 1391139 17258089 17554300 17572673 10857744

We attempted to identify common genetic variants associated with log relative telomere length using genome-wide genotyping data on 3,554 individuals from the Nurses' Health Study and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial that took part in the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility initiative for breast and prostate cancer. After genotyping 64 independent SNPs selected for replication in additional Nurses' Health Study and Women's Genome Health Study participants, we did not identify genome-wide significant loci; however, we replicated the inverse association of log relative telomere length with the minor allele variant [C] of rs16847897 at the TERC locus (per allele β = -0.03, P = 0.003) identified by a previous genome-wide association study. We did not find evidence for an association with variants at the OBFC1 locus or other loci reported to be associated with telomere length. With this sample size we had >80% power to detect β estimates as small as ±0.10 for SNPs with minor allele frequencies of ≥0.15 at genome-wide significance. However, power is greatly reduced for β estimates smaller than ±0.10, such as those for variants at the TERC locus. In general, common genetic variants associated with telomere length homeostasis have been difficult to detect. Potential biological and technical issues are discussed.	 14975611 15071557 2392154 1438199 7977349 7605428 7727765 7568077 16332973 16552446 16862161 16824017 17043079 17223473 17215319 17395830 17416776 17401363 17529973 17623782 17701901 17874998 17725691 17925004 10948077 17913752 17881651 18070814 18227361 18270372 18282113 18348202 18253166 18452563 18487243 18996878 18799354 18668136 19151717 19214207 19273484 18820651 19327580 19293310 19217888 15161972 15189140 15289453 4754905 19359265 19493248 19648609 19285750 8710384 9044835 9425906 9576930 9600234 9703424 9723031 10338204 15520935 15771613 15753114 15998890 15998891 16112303 16110488 16166375 16258070 16284252 16364206 16400618 16421168 16487204 16440201 19766477 20016592 19784860 19915151 19826452 20139977 20195384 20219960 20421499 20606151 20508208 20651707 20597107 20549820 11081503 11080530 11189683 11189684 11470873 11513915 11830355 11836503 12000852 12114022 12193671 12539050 12573379 12735903 12649083 12887925 12928346
21565293	Genome-wide association study identifies four genetic loci associated with thyroid volume and goiter risk.	Thyroid disorders such as goiters represent important diseases, especially in iodine-deficient areas. Sibling studies have demonstrated that genetic factors substantially contribute to the interindividual variation of thyroid volume. We performed a genome-wide association study of this phenotype by analyzing a discovery cohort consisting of 3620 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). Four genetic loci were associated with thyroid volume on a genome-wide level of significance. Of these, two independent loci are located upstream of and within CAPZB, which encodes the β subunit of the barbed-end F-actin binding protein that modulates actin polymerization, a process crucial in the colloid engulfment during thyroglobulin mobilization in the thyroid. The third locus marks FGF7, which encodes fibroblast growth factor 7. Members of this protein family have been discussed as putative signal molecules involved in the regulation of thyroid development. The fourth locus represents a "gene desert" on chromosome 16q23, located directly downstream of the predicted coding sequence LOC440389, which, however, had already been removed from the NCBI database as a result of the standard genome annotation processing at the time that this study was initiated. Experimental proof of the formerly predicted mature mRNA, however, demonstrates that LOC440389 indeed represents a real gene. All four associations were replicated in an independent sample of 1290 participants of the KORA study. These results increase the knowledge about genetic factors and physiological mechanisms influencing thyroid volume.	 10487667 9662941 16032514 16235152 16807415 17701901 18192692 18348202 18544499 18765562 19820697 20826269 20167617 10631169 11062007 11180951 11276432 11525270 12487770 12660160 15126523 15233312 15294161 15466939 7274082 2870372 3292188 1447293 7929588 8858171 9023197 9506723 9501086 15845376
21572414	A genome-wide association study of metabolic traits in human urine.	We present a genome-wide association study of metabolic traits in human urine, designed to investigate the detoxification capacity of the human body. Using NMR spectroscopy, we tested for associations between 59 metabolites in urine from 862 male participants in the population-based SHIP study. We replicated the results using 1,039 additional samples of the same study, including a 5-year follow-up, and 992 samples from the independent KORA study. We report five loci with joint P values of association from 3.2 × 10(-19) to 2.1 × 10(-182). Variants at three of these loci have previously been linked with important clinical outcomes: SLC7A9 is a risk locus for chronic kidney disease, NAT2 for coronary artery disease and genotype-dependent response to drug toxicity, and SLC6A20 for iminoglycinuria. Moreover, we identify rs37369 in AGXT2 as the genetic basis of hyper-β-aminoisobutyric aciduria.	 20453387 18359399 19043545 20167617 16602095 20038957 20415545 21085649 19033659 15944335 18372322 20686565 5773299 11565448 20383145 14806475 19820697 20383146 16710357 17273169 13058271 20037589 17701901 15930091 15632147 15385443 18687662 19148276 19798445 1347093 5814159 17675654 20018850 16808451
21573128	Common variants in a novel gene, FONG on chromosome 2q33.1 confer risk of osteoporosis in Japanese.	Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by low bone mass, decreased bone quality and increased predisposition to fracture. Genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology; however, the specific genes related to susceptibility to osteoporosis are not entirely known. To detect susceptibility genes for osteoporosis, we conducted a genome-wide association study in Japanese using ∼270,000 SNPs in 1,747 subjects (190 cases and 1,557 controls) followed by multiple levels of replication of the association using a total of ∼5,000 subjects (2,092 cases and 3,114 controls). Through these staged association studies followed by resequencing and linkage disequilibrium mapping, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7605378 associated with osteoporosis. (combined P = 1.51×10(-8), odds ratio = 1.25). This SNP is in a previously unknown gene on chromosome 2q33.1, FONG. FONG is predicted to encode a 147 amino-acid protein with a formiminotransferase domain in its N-terminal (FTCD_N domain) and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including bone. Our findings would give a new insight into osteoporosis etiology and pathogenesis.	 11285309 16980579 11685647 12050122 12436197 12426569 12740006 7654689 15297300 16455317 16862161 16957773 16995806 17206144 17309882 17554300 17529967 17903296 17943122 17982410 18372905 18455228 18445777 18622395 18776929 19079262 19249006 19801982 19920351 20072603 20096396 20131257 20466812 20418485 20548944 20711176 11501945

21572416	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies common variants associated with blood pressure variation in east Asians.	We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in 19,608 subjects of east Asian ancestry from the AGEN-BP consortium followed up with de novo genotyping (n = 10,518) and further replication (n = 20,247) in east Asian samples. We identified genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)) associations with SBP or DBP, which included variants at four new loci (ST7L-CAPZA1, FIGN-GRB14, ENPEP and NPR3) and a newly discovered variant near TBX3. Among the five newly discovered variants, we obtained significant replication in the independent samples for all of these loci except NPR3. We also confirmed seven loci previously identified in populations of European descent. Moreover, at 12q24.13 near ALDH2, we observed strong association signals (P = 7.9 × 10(-31) and P = 1.3 × 10(-35) for SBP and DBP, respectively) with ethnic specificity. These findings provide new insights into blood pressure regulation and potential targets for intervention.	 19307593 19320537 19359342 19820697 19811816 20308177 20479155 20414254 19430479 19430483 20921432 20935629 21058334 21060005 21060004 21372407 12574083 11017077 11315092 12012006 12423980 12958120 6987864 9851379 15652604 15911072 16494531 16731270 17033627 17357068 17572673 17873874 17873877 17943131 17984165 18318597 18256235 17990103 18456100 18974171 19200528 19262484 19456322

21602797	Genome-wide association and linkage identify modifier loci of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis at 11p13 and 20q13.2.	A combined genome-wide association and linkage study was used to identify loci causing variation in cystic fibrosis lung disease severity. We identified a significant association (P = 3.34 × 10(-8)) near EHF and APIP (chr11p13) in p.Phe508del homozygotes (n = 1,978). The association replicated in p.Phe508del homozygotes (P = 0.006) from a separate family based study (n = 557), with P = 1.49 × 10(-9) for the three-study joint meta-analysis. Linkage analysis of 486 sibling pairs from the family based study identified a significant quantitative trait locus on chromosome 20q13.2 (log(10) odds = 5.03). Our findings provide insight into the causes of variation in lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis and suggest new therapeutic targets for this life-limiting disorder.	 16434123 16415888 16921375 17086211 17332481 17604723 17701901 17924335 17921354 17570842 18292811 18475289 18587042 18992358 19014478 10557320 10644770 11259407 11593451 11731797 11836738 11889220 12111878 12444029 12559563 15240811 15262985 15463819 7200340 8474788 8166795 7963289 7581446 9427882 9545414 19300482 19300500 19656839 19581427 20010834 20010835 20046828 19626703 20173748 19937461 21175684 20681990 21045008 21462361 16800000 9872837 15556263 15618464 15976373 16207846 16400608
21602798	Genome-wide association study of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry identifies a susceptibility locus at 17q21.	In search of common risk alleles for prostate cancer that could contribute to high rates of the disease in men of African ancestry, we conducted a genome-wide association study, with 1,047,986 SNP markers examined in 3,425 African-Americans with prostate cancer (cases) and 3,290 African-American male controls. We followed up the most significant 17 new associations from stage 1 in 1,844 cases and 3,269 controls of African ancestry. We identified a new risk variant on chromosome 17q21 (rs7210100, odds ratio per allele = 1.51, P = 3.4 × 10(-13)). The frequency of the risk allele is ∼5% in men of African descent, whereas it is rare in other populations (<1%). Further studies are needed to investigate the biological contribution of this allele to prostate cancer risk. These findings emphasize the importance of conducting genome-wide association studies in diverse populations.	 11533236 19430483 16862161 16945910 17401363 17401364 17401366 17603485 18264096 18264097 18264098 19543370 19715440 19767752 19767753 19767754 19767755 20204290 20676098 16682969

21612516	Association study on long-living individuals from Southern Italy identifies rs10491334 in the CAMKIV gene that regulates survival proteins.	Long-living individuals (LLIs) are used to study exceptional longevity. A number of genetic variants have been found associated in LLIs to date, but further identification of variants would improve knowledge on the mechanisms regulating the rate of aging. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study on 410 LLIs and 553 young control individuals with a 317K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to identify novel traits associated with aging. Among the top (p < 1 × 10(-4)) SNPs initially identified, we found rs10491334 (CAMKIV) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.73; p = 2.88 × 10(-5)), a variant previously reported associated with diastolic blood pressure, associated also in a replication set of 116 LLIs and 160 controls (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.32-0.90; p = 9 × 10(-3)). Furthermore, in vitro analysis established that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) activates the survival proteins AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3A, and we found that homozygous carriers of rs10491334 have a significant reduction in CAMKIV expression. This, together with the observed reduction in minor-allele carriers among centenarians, points to a detrimental role for the SNP. In conclusion, prolongevity genes are activated by CAMKIV, the levels of which are influenced by rs10491334, a SNP associated with human longevity.	
21618603	Evidence for gene-environment interaction in a genome wide study of nonsyndromic cleft palate.	Nonsyndromic cleft palate (CP) is a common birth defect with a complex and heterogeneous etiology involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 550 case-parent trios, ascertained through a CP case collected in an international consortium. Family-based association tests of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and three common maternal exposures (maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, and multivitamin supplementation) were used in a combined 2 df test for gene (G) and gene-environment (G × E) interaction simultaneously, plus a separate 1 df test for G × E interaction alone. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate effects on risk to exposed and unexposed children. While no SNP achieved genome-wide significance when considered alone, markers in several genes attained or approached genome-wide significance when G × E interaction was included. Among these, MLLT3 and SMC2 on chromosome 9 showed multiple SNPs resulting in an increased risk if the mother consumed alcohol during the peri-conceptual period (3 months prior to conception through the first trimester). TBK1 on chr. 12 and ZNF236 on chr. 18 showed multiple SNPs associated with higher risk of CP in the presence of maternal smoking. Additional evidence of reduced risk due to G × E interaction in the presence of multivitamin supplementation was observed for SNPs in BAALC on chr. 8. These results emphasize the need to consider G × E interaction when searching for genes influencing risk to complex and heterogeneous disorders, such as nonsyndromic CP.	 11055368 21423016 15112010 7702037 9415696 15643916 16096111 16619052 17283440 17701901 18250102 18667525 18583393 19441124 19752161 20358594 20436469 20932509 21181894 12925516

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a universally prevalent, genetic, and environment dependent mental condition that disables people of every culture, race, gender, and age. While the gender differences for MDD have been widely reported in literature, few genome-wide analyses of gender differences have been reported to date.	
21626137	Two-marker association tests yield new disease associations for coronary artery disease and hypertension.	It has been postulated that multiple-marker methods may have added ability, over single-marker methods, to detect genetic variants associated with disease. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) provided the first successful large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which included single-marker association analyses for seven common complex diseases. Of those signals detected, only one was associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), and none were identified for hypertension (HTN). Our objective was to find additional genetic associations and pathways for cardiovascular disease by examining the WTCCC data for variants associated with CAD and HTN using two-marker testing methods. We applied two-marker association testing to the WTCCC dataset, which includes ~2,000 affected individuals with each disorder, and a shared pool of ~3,000 controls, all genotyped using Affymetrix GeneChip 500 K arrays. For CAD, we detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) pairs in three genes showing genome-wide significance: HFE2, STK32B, and DIPC2. The most notable SNP pairs in a non-protein-coding region were at 9p21, a known major CAD-associated region. For HTN, we detected SNP pairs in five genes: GPR39, XRCC4, MYO6, ZFAT, and MACROD2. Four further associated SNP pair regions were at least 70 kb from any known gene. We have shown that novel, multiple-marker, statistical methods can be of use in finding variants in GWAS. We describe many new, associated variants for both CAD and HTN and describe their known genetic mechanisms.	 11254454 21239051 12891378 7493015 10231032 15700229 16611673 17124166 17554300 17646721 18252216 18224336 18398418 18775791 19553259 19717731 19557751 20031549 19956784 19847924 20299663 19430479 19430483 12214310
21623375	Genome-wide association identifies three new susceptibility loci for Paget's disease of bone.	Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common disorder characterized by focal abnormalities of bone remodeling. We previously identified variants at the CSF1, OPTN and TNFRSF11A loci as risk factors for PDB by genome-wide association study. Here we extended this study, identified three new loci and confirmed their association with PDB in 2,215 affected individuals (cases) and 4,370 controls from seven independent populations. The new associations were with rs5742915 within PML on 15q24 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, P = 1.6 × 10(-14)), rs10498635 within RIN3 on 14q32 (OR = 1.44, P = 2.55 × 10(-11)) and rs4294134 within NUP205 on 7q33 (OR = 1.45, P = 8.45 × 10(-10)). Our data also confirmed the association of TM7SF4 (rs2458413, OR = 1.40, P = 7.38 × 10(-17)) with PDB. These seven loci explained ∼13% of the familial risk of PDB. These studies provide new insights into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of PDB.	 15452179 11169400 18997784 12370802 20499339 15356634 20200946 20089971 11992264 3802833 15034582 18462017 20581827 12374763 17404618 7610939 20436471 12972505 19067022 9348540 20502693 19801982 11733506 20721934 20233392 9933472 15005843 2068956 17554300 20634204 17701901 20839008 16228001 18348202 17873874 19580457 16061724 18846210 20220756

21640322	Genetic variants at 13q12.12 are associated with high myopia in the Han Chinese population.	High myopia, which is extremely prevalent in the Chinese population, is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Genetic factors play a critical role in the development of the condition. To identify the genetic variants associated with high myopia in the Han Chinese, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 493,947 SNPs in 1088 individuals (419 cases and 669 controls) from a Han Chinese cohort and followed up on signals that were associated with p < 1.0 × 10(-4) in three independent cohorts (combined, 2803 cases and 5642 controls). We identified a significant association between high myopia and a variant at 13q12.12 (rs9318086, combined p = 1.91 × 10(-16), heterozygous odds ratio = 1.32, and homozygous odds ratio = 1.64). Furthermore, five additional SNPs (rs9510902, rs3794338, rs1886970, rs7325450, and rs7331047) in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block with rs9318086 also proved to be significantly associated with high myopia in the Han Chinese population; p values ranged from 5.46 × 10(-11) to 6.16 × 10(-16). This associated locus contains three genes-MIPEP, C1QTNF9B-AS1, and C1QTNF9B. MIPEP and C1QTNF9B were found to be expressed in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and are more likely than C1QTNF9B-AS1 to be associated with high myopia given the evidence of retinal signaling that controls eye growth. Our results suggest that the variants at 13q12.12 are associated with high myopia.	 10937558 21436269 12944416 15078666 15069058 9073519 16862161 21744425 17065484 17053108 17701901 18243904 18794853 18846214 19104465 19104467 18757506 19644859 19779542 19915572 20008719 20526339 20439292 20484597 20835236 20835239 21031016 21095009 11787748
21642993	Genome-wide association study identifies three new susceptibility loci for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in Chinese populations.	Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and occurs at a relatively high frequency in China. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for ESCC, we conducted a genome-wide association study on 2,031 individuals with ESCC (cases) and 2,044 controls of Chinese descent using 666,141 autosomal SNPs. We evaluated promising associations in an additional 6,276 cases and 6,165 controls of Chinese descent from different areas of China. We identified seven susceptibility loci on chromosomes 5q11, 6p21, 10q23, 12q24 and 21q22 (ranging from P = 7.48 × 10(-12) to P = 2.44 × 10(-31)); among these loci, 5q11, 6p21 and 21q22 were newly identified. Three variants in high linkage disequilibrium on 12q24 confer their risks to ESCC in a gene-lifestyle interaction manner, with more pronounced risk enhancement seen in tobacco and alcohol users. Furthermore, the identified variants had a cumulative association with ESCC risk (P(trend) = 7.92 × 10(-56)). These findings highlight the involvement of multiple genetic loci and gene-environment interaction in the development of esophageal cancer.	 14769797 16862161 16557282 18846217 20171175 15611932 20169162 20729852 15864279 15604243 18519675 19430479 17227708 20729853 20308320 15297300 15057898 17450141 19820697 19140131 15386419 15846068 10213495 18199855 19698717 17701901 17674361 19396169 11935298 11309278 16083713 15240787

21647738	Genome-wide association with C-reactive protein levels in CLHNS: evidence for the CRP and HNF1A loci and their interaction with exposure to a pathogenic environment.	Recent genome-wide association studies have related several genetic loci, including C-reactive protein (CRP), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox (HNF1A), and genetic variations in the leptin receptor (LEPR), to circulating CRP levels in populations of European ancestry. The genetic effects in other populations and across varying levels of exposure to a pathogenic environment, an important environmental factor associated with CRP, remain to be determined. We tested 2,073,674 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with plasma CRP (limited to ≤10 mg/L) in 1,709 unrelated Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. The strongest evidence of association was observed with variants at CRP (rs876537, P = 1.4 × 10(-9)) and HNF1A (rs7305618, P = 1.0 × 10(-8)). Among other previously reported CRP-associated loci, the apolipoprotein E ε4 haplotype was associated with decreased CRP level (P = 7.1 × 10(-4)), and modest association was observed with LEPR (rs1892534, P = 0.076), with direction of effects consistent with previous studies. The strongest signal at a locus not previously reported mapped to a gene desert region on chromosome 6q16.1 (rs1408282, P = 2.9 × 10(-6)). Finally, we observed nominal evidence of interaction with exposure to a pathogenic environment for top main effect SNPs at HNF1A (rs7305618, P = 0.031), LEPR (rs1892535, P = 0.030) and 6q16.1 (rs1408282, P = 0.046). Our findings demonstrate convincing evidence that genetic variants in CRP and HNF1A contribute to plasma CRP in Filipino women and provide the first evidence that exposure to a pathogenic environment may modify the genetic influence at the HNF1A, LEPR, and 6q16.1 loci on plasma CRP level.	 20154341 20007176 21058334 20212493 20507864 11257270 12524541 12842840 15530909 15337754 15585211 15585218 15778807 16266402 16534007 17164456 17161935 17868801 18292576 18439548 18439552 19022970 19225115 19733727 20031592 19434077 20634204

21654844	Genome-wide association study of severity in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system with a strong genetic component. Several lines of evidence support a strong role for genetic factors influencing both disease susceptibility and clinical outcome in MS. Identification of genetic variants that distinguish particular disease subgroups and/or predict a severe clinical outcome is critical to further our understanding of disease mechanisms and guide development of effective therapeutic approaches. We studied 1470 MS cases and performed a genome-wide association study of more than 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms to identify loci influencing disease severity, measured using the MS severity score (MSSS), a measure of clinical disability. Of note, no single result achieved genome-wide significance. Furthermore, variants within previously confirmed MS susceptibility loci do not appear to influence severity. Although bioinformatic analyses highlight certain pathways that are over-represented in our results, we conclude that the genetic architecture of disease severity is likely polygenic and comprised of modest effects, similar to what has been described for MS susceptibility, to date. However, a role for major effects of rare variants cannot be excluded. Importantly, our results also show the MSSS, when considered as a binary or continuous phenotype variable is by comparison a stable outcome.	 18414509 20796172 19138773 19525953 17569088 17660530 17786212 18087043 18278054 18655317 18687884 10588391 10592173 10817592 10856223 10934166 11456302 11834600 12176032 14966475 15161628 8381897 8475063 8989520 9427503 9518527 9784606 10331690 15596747 15742215 15824338 15830322 15980575 15917267 15973459 16372011 16372012 16381885 16372019 16682670 16738228 16834700 16883070 17011703 17124177 17018562 17261686 17437613 19574997 19775910 19880382 20106349 20007504 20117844 20368992 20146355 20139422 20467836 19865102 20555355 20625377 19010793
21659334	Genome-wide association study identified ITPA/DDRGK1 variants reflecting thrombocytopenia in pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C.	Hematologic abnormalities during current therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) often necessitate dose reduction and premature withdrawal from therapy. The aim of this study was to identify host factors associated with IFN-induced thrombocytopenia by genome-wide association study (GWAS). In the GWAS stage using 900K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, 303 Japanese CHC patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV therapy were genotyped. One SNP (rs11697186) located on DDRGK1 gene on chromosome 20 showed strong associations in the minor-allele-dominant model with the decrease of platelet counts in response to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy [P = 8.17 × 10(-9); odds ratio (OR) = 4.6]. These associations were replicated in another sample set (n = 391) and the combined P-values reached 5.29 × 10(-17) (OR = 4.5). Fine mapping with 22 SNPs around DDRGK1 and ITPA genes showed that rs11697186 at the GWAS stage had a strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1127354, known as a functional variant in the ITPA gene. The ITPA-AA/CA genotype was independently associated with a higher degree of reduction in platelet counts at week 4 (P < 0.0001), as well as protection against the reduction in hemoglobin, whereas the CC genotype had significantly less reduction in the mean platelet counts compared with the AA/CA genotype (P < 0.0001 for weeks 2, 4, 8, 12), due to a reactive increase of the platelet count through weeks 1-4. Our present results may provide a valuable pharmacogenetic diagnostic tool for tailoring PEG-IFN/RBV dosing to minimize drug-induced adverse events.	
21665990	Common variants near FRK/COL10A1 and VEGFA are associated with advanced age-related macular degeneration.	Despite significant progress in the identification of genetic loci for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), not all of the heritability has been explained. To identify variants which contribute to the remaining genetic susceptibility, we performed the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to date for advanced AMD. We imputed 6 036 699 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with the 1000 Genomes Project reference genotypes on 2594 cases and 4134 controls with follow-up replication of top signals in 5640 cases and 52 174 controls. We identified two new common susceptibility alleles, rs1999930 on 6q21-q22.3 near FRK/COL10A1 [odds ratio (OR) 0.87; P = 1.1 × 10(-8)] and rs4711751 on 6p12 near VEGFA (OR 1.15; P = 8.7 × 10(-9)). In addition to the two novel loci, 10 previously reported loci in ARMS2/HTRA1 (rs10490924), CFH (rs1061170, and rs1410996), CFB (rs641153), C3 (rs2230199), C2 (rs9332739), CFI (rs10033900), LIPC (rs10468017), TIMP3 (rs9621532) and CETP (rs3764261) were confirmed with genome-wide significant signals in this large study. Loci in the recently reported genes ABCA1 and COL8A1 were also detected with suggestive evidence of association with advanced AMD. The novel variants identified in this study suggest that angiogenesis (VEGFA) and extracellular collagen matrix (FRK/COL10A1) pathways contribute to the development of advanced AMD.	 15767473 15761120 15761121 15761122 15870199 16080115 16151532 16174643 16384981 16458093 16518403 16862161 16936732 16936733 17529973 17701901 17728769 17767156 17924348 18204098 18264096 18587394 18776909 18852200 18685559 19200528 19198609 19117606 19117936 19304944 19417570 19543373 19700477 20212207 19844262 20385819 20385826 20547953 20616382 20498197 20693478 21058334 21122828 21447678 21959373 11594942 12524541 12796248 12945014 9008168
21665994	Genome-wide association study identifies two loci strongly affecting transferrin glycosylation.	Polysaccharide sidechains attached to proteins play important roles in cell-cell and receptor-ligand interactions. Variation in the carbohydrate component has been extensively studied for the iron transport protein transferrin, because serum levels of the transferrin isoforms asialotransferrin + disialotransferrin (carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, CDT) are used as biomarkers of excessive alcohol intake. We conducted a genome-wide association study to assess whether genetic factors affect CDT concentration in serum. CDT was measured in three population-based studies: one in Switzerland (CoLaus study, n = 5181) and two in Australia (n = 1509, n = 775). The first cohort was used as the discovery panel and the latter ones served as replication. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing data were used to identify loci with significant associations with CDT as a percentage of total transferrin (CDT%). The top three SNPs in the discovery panel (rs2749097 near PGM1 on chromosome 1, and missense polymorphisms rs1049296, rs1799899 in TF on chromosome 3) were successfully replicated , yielding genome-wide significant combined association with CDT% (P = 1.9 × 10(-9), 4 × 10(-39), 5.5 × 10(-43), respectively) and explain 5.8% of the variation in CDT%. These allelic effects are postulated to be caused by variation in availability of glucose-1-phosphate as a precursor of the glycan (PGM1), and variation in transferrin (TF) structure.	 10580125 19896111 11427453 3044178 9438535 9836715 16126345 16862161 17412797 17572673 17194218 17701901 18256235 18366642 18462017 18487284 19084217 19715440 11308015
21665993	Association of variants in FRAP1 and PDGFRA with corneal curvature in Asian populations from Singapore.	Corneal curvature (CC) is a key determinant of major eye diseases, such as keratoconus, myopia and corneal astigmatism. No prior studies have discovered the genes for CC. Here we report the findings from four genome-wide association studies of CC in 10 008 samples from three population groups in Singapore. Our discovery phase surveyed 2867 Chinese and 3072 Malays, allowing us to identify two loci that were associated with CC variation: FRAP1 on chromosome 1p36.2 and PDGFRA on chromosome 4q12. These findings were subsequently replicated in a validation study involving an additional 2953 Asian Indians and a further collection of 1116 Chinese children. The effect sizes of the identified variants were consistent across all four cohorts, with seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FRAP1 (lead SNP: rs17036350, meta P-value = 4.06 × 10(-13)) and six SNPs in PDGFRA (lead SNP: rs2114039, meta P-value = 1.33 × 10(-9)) attaining genome-wide significance in the SNP-based meta-analysis of the four studies. This is the first genome-wide survey of CC variation and we have identified two implicated loci in three genetically diverse Asian populations, suggesting the presence of common genetic etiology across multiple populations.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests a heritable component to risk for sudden cardiac arrest independent of risk for myocardial infarction. Recent candidate gene association studies for community sudden cardiac arrests have focused on a limited number of biological pathways and yielded conflicting results. We sought to identify novel gene associations for sudden cardiac arrest in patients with coronary artery disease by performing a genome-wide association study.	 11684624 20360844 11761419 11855950 12952881 14600184 15213208 2911968 2468430 7476138 9445167 9826323 10209001 15761122 15863612 16618831 16648850 16845085 16862161 16940195 17115186 17998470 18337493 18369459 18235038 18534365 18511491 18927126 19204306 18463975 19351512 19412176 19716087 19716088 19959123 11794197
21666692	Genome-wide association study reveals three susceptibility loci for common migraine in the general population.	Migraine is a common, heterogeneous and heritable neurological disorder. Its pathophysiology is incompletely understood, and its genetic influences at the population level are unknown. In a population-based genome-wide analysis including 5,122 migraineurs and 18,108 non-migraineurs, rs2651899 (1p36.32, PRDM16), rs10166942 (2q37.1, TRPM8) and rs11172113 (12q13.3, LRP1) were among the top seven associations (P < 5 × 10(-6)) with migraine. These SNPs were significant in a meta-analysis among three replication cohorts and met genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis combining the discovery and replication cohorts (rs2651899, odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, P = 3.8 × 10(-9); rs10166942, OR = 0.85, P = 5.5 × 10(-12); and rs11172113, OR = 0.90, P = 4.3 × 10(-9)). The associations at rs2651899 and rs10166942 were specific for migraine compared with non-migraine headache. None of the three SNP associations was preferential for migraine with aura or without aura, nor were any associations specific for migraine features. TRPM8 has been the focus of neuropathic pain models, whereas LRP1 modulates neuronal glutamate signaling, plausibly linking both genes to migraine pathophysiology.	 14624726 11893340 8547101 16426991 16920620 17943122 18070814 18511441 18626063 18778570 19339685 19426123 19455354 20802479 14979299
21666691	Genome-wide association study identifies two new susceptibility loci for atopic dermatitis in the Chinese Han population.	Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing form of inflammatory skin disorder that is affected by genetic and environmental factors. We performed a genome-wide association study of atopic dermatitis in a Chinese Han population using 1,012 affected individuals (cases) and 1,362 controls followed by a replication study in an additional 3,624 cases and 12,197 controls of Chinese Han ethnicity, as well as 1,806 cases and 3,256 controls from Germany. We identified previously undescribed susceptibility loci at 5q22.1 (TMEM232 and SLC25A46, rs7701890, P(combined) = 3.15 × 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 1.24) and 20q13.33 (TNFRSF6B and ZGPAT, rs6010620, P(combined) = 3.0 × 10(-8), OR = 1.17) and replicated another previously reported locus at 1q21.3 (FLG, rs3126085, P(combined) = 5.90 × 10(-12), OR = 0.82) in the Chinese sample. The 20q13.33 locus also showed evidence for association in the German sample (rs6010620, P = 2.87 × 10(-5), OR = 1.25). Our study identifies new genetic susceptibility factors and suggests previously unidentified biological pathways in atopic dermatitis.	 18006694 16134991 16862161 20018961 16490960 11994433 14598172 12819035 11390428 12413772 19720209 20526339 19169255 15282937 19656476 19644445 12958120 19187332 15297300 18155278 18587394 15924217 20109730 21039602 16617106 16550169 19638684 19838193 13655060 11600885 15322986 19349984 19198610 14657214 2248957 12761893
21685187	Genome-wide association study of smoking behaviours in patients with COPD.	Background Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COPD severity. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) locus associated with smoking cessation in multiple populations. Objective To identify SNPs associated with lifetime average and current CPD, age at smoking initiation, and smoking cessation in patients with COPD. Methods GWAS were conducted in four independent cohorts encompassing 3441 ever-smoking patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease stage II or higher). Untyped SNPs were imputed using the HapMap (phase II) panel. Results from all cohorts were meta-analysed. Results Several SNPs near the HLA region on chromosome 6p21 and in an intergenic region on chromosome 2q21 showed associations with age at smoking initiation, both with the lowest p=2×10(-7). No SNPs were associated with lifetime average CPD, current CPD or smoking cessation with p<10(-6). Nominally significant associations with candidate SNPs within cholinergic receptors, nicotinic, alpha 3/5 (CHRNA3/CHRNA5; eg, p=0.00011 for SNP rs1051730) and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily A, polypeptide 6 (CYP2A6; eg, p=2.78×10(-5) for a non-synonymous SNP rs1801272) regions were observed for lifetime average CPD, however only CYP2A6 showed evidence of significant association with current CPD. A candidate SNP (rs3025343) in DBH was significantly (p=0.015) associated with smoking cessation. Conclusion The authors identified two candidate regions associated with age at smoking initiation in patients with COPD. Associations of CHRNA3/CHRNA5 and CYP2A6 loci with CPD and DBH with smoking cessation are also likely of importance in the smoking behaviours of patients with COPD.	 19188921 19547629 19169923 19715440 19820697 19819424 20173748 20214461 20418888 20418889 20418890 20700436 20634204 20981092 20840187 12492752 12740294 12759479 14685227 15313363 742764 10225243 16380569 16374522 16862161 17384015 17446335 17701901 17915073 18216052 18300295 18385739 18618000 18827152 18974171 19247474 19300482 19483681
21681796	Genome-wide association studies of cerebral white matter lesion burden: the CHARGE consortium.	White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) detectable by magnetic resonance imaging are part of the spectrum of vascular injury associated with aging of the brain and are thought to reflect ischemic damage to the small deep cerebral vessels. WMHs are associated with an increased risk of cognitive and motor dysfunction, dementia, depression, and stroke. Despite a significant heritability, few genetic loci influencing WMH burden have been identified.	 12111919 19109541 11511098 19222302 19430483 18836477 19369658 12417378 12768255 14718359 15143299 19407234 19430479 20460622 19926835 20031568 19834011 8414012 8801636 9056627 9626291 10228168 15699467 16041288 16192459 16237670 16322484 17273975 16906552 17873874 17873877 18300295 18451988
21679298	A genome-wide association study for quantitative traits in schizophrenia in China.	Few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia have included Chinese populations, and verification of positive genetic findings from other ethnic groups is rare in Chinese groups. We used fluid intelligence as the quantitative trait reflecting schizophrenia dysfunction in Chinese populations, and determined the impact of genetic variation on fluid intelligence phenotypic patterns to identify genetic influences in schizophrenia. The study sample comprised 98 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy controls. The general fluid intelligence of participants was assessed with Cattell's Culture-Free Intelligence Test (CCFIT). Subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap 660 beadchip. We identified the methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) gene on chromosome 8 as having an association with fluid intelligence. However, only CCFIT subtest 1 (series score) demonstrated a significant result for the interaction term using the criteria of the quantitative trait (QT) analysis of 10(-5)  for at least three SNPs. There were 15 haplotype blocks of MSRA gene SNPs identified using Haploview 4.2 with solid spine D' > 0.80. The strongest QT interaction was noted in Block 3, with the most common haplotypes being AAACAGCAG and CGCAGAAGA. In conclusion, we report data from a GWAS with quantitative traits design from Chinese first-episode schizophrenia patients and matched controls. Although the gene identified requires confirmation in an independent sample, the MSRA gene located on chromosome 8 was found to be associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia.	
21688384	Genome-wide association analysis of age at onset in schizophrenia in a European-American sample.	We performed a genome-wide association analysis to identify genetic variants influencing age at onset (AAO) and examine gene × gender interactions for AAO in schizophrenia (SCZ) using a European-American sample (1,162 cases). Linear regression model in PLINK was used to test for associations with AAO while the GxE option was chosen to test for the influence of gene × gender interactions. The most significant association with AAO was observed with SNP rs7819815 (P = 3.10×10(-7)) at 8q24.22. The next best signal was at 4q25 in COL25A1 gene (rs17039583, P = 4.30×10(-6)) and the third region was at 4p16.1 (rs17407555, P = 4.56×10(-6) , near RAF1P1, and rs4697924, P = 1.23×10(-5) within WDR1 gene). Conditional analysis on chromosome 4 indicated that 4p16.1 and 4q25 loci were independent. Furthermore, 2 SNPs (rs16834822 and rs16834824) at 1q43 in RYR2 showed strong associations in the female sample (P = 2.10×10(-6) and 2.33×10(-6) , respectively) and strong gene × gender interactions in influencing AAO (P = 9.23×10(-7) and 1.15×10(-6) , respectively) while the second best region showing gene × gender interaction was at 7q22.3 (rs179863, P = 2.33×10(-6) ). Using an independent sample of 1,068 cases, we could not replicate the associations for above top SNPs; however, we found nominal significance associations for their flanking SNPs (P < 0.05). These findings provide evidence of several genetic variants influencing AAO of SCZ.	
21685912	Identification of common variants influencing risk of the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy.	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a movement disorder with prominent tau neuropathology. Brain diseases with abnormal tau deposits are called tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease. Environmental causes of tauopathies include repetitive head trauma associated with some sports. To identify common genetic variation contributing to risk for tauopathies, we carried out a genome-wide association study of 1,114 individuals with PSP (cases) and 3,247 controls (stage 1) followed by a second stage in which we genotyped 1,051 cases and 3,560 controls for the stage 1 SNPs that yielded P ≤ 10(-3). We found significant previously unidentified signals (P < 5 × 10(-8)) associated with PSP risk at STX6, EIF2AK3 and MOBP. We confirmed two independent variants in MAPT affecting risk for PSP, one of which influences MAPT brain expression. The genes implicated encode proteins for vesicle-membrane fusion at the Golgi-endosomal interface, for the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response and for a myelin structural component.	 11425937 19734902 12430710 14978673 15217544 7969952 8710059 8710069 9343467 10072441 15654335 16195395 16140387 16415888 16691116 16862161 16912714 17028425 17085483 17185385 17254549 17174556 17493041 17554299 17701901 18208329 18252225 19022385 19165922 19199926 19734903 19915575 19455578 19710684 20088021 20460622 20485568 20472654 20720505 20862653 21088431 21292315 21460840 21460841 19264902 11555414
21682944	DOCK4 and CEACAM21 as novel schizophrenia candidate genes in the Jewish population.	It is well accepted that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component. Several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia have been published in recent years; most of them population based with a case-control design. Nevertheless, identifying the specific genetic variants which contribute to susceptibility to the disorder remains a challenging task. A family-based GWAS strategy may be helpful in the identification of schizophrenia susceptibility genes since it is protected against population stratification, enables better accounting for genotyping errors and is more sensitive for identification of rare variants which have a very low frequency in the general population. In this project we implemented a family-based GWAS of schizophrenia in a sample of 107 Jewish-Israeli families. We found one genome-wide significant association in the intron of the DOCK4 gene (rs2074127, p value=1.134×10⁻⁷) and six additional nominally significant association signals with p<1×10⁻⁵. One of the top single nucleotide polymorphisms (p<1×10⁻⁵) which is located in the predicted intron of the CEACAM21 gene was significantly replicated in independent family-based sample of Arab-Israeli origin (rs4803480: p value=0.002; combined p value=9.61×10⁻⁸), surviving correction for multiple testing. Both DOCK4 and CEACAM21 are biologically reasonable candidate genes for schizophrenia although generalizability of the association of DOCK4 with schizophrenia should be investigated in further studies. In addition, gene-wide significant associations were found within three schizophrenia candidate genes: PGBD1, RELN and PRODH, replicating previously reported associations. By application of a family-based strategy to GWAS, our study revealed new schizophrenia susceptibility loci in the Jewish-Israeli population.	
21699788	HLA-Cw*1202-B*5201-DRB1*1502 haplotype increases risk for ulcerative colitis but reduces risk for Crohn's disease.

However, genetic factors that have distinct effects on UC and CD have not been examined.	
21703634	A meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies identifies 3 new loci for alcohol dependence.	Family, twin and adoption studies have clearly demonstrated that genetic factors are important in modulating the vulnerability to alcohol dependence. Several genome-wide association (GWA) studies of alcohol dependence have been conducted; however, few loci have been replicated. A meta-analysis was performed on two GWA studies of 1283 cases of alcohol dependence and 1416 controls in Caucasian populations. Through meta-analysis we identified 131 SNPs associated with alcohol dependence with p<10(-4). The best novel signal was rs6701037 (p=1.86 × 10(-7)) at 1q24-q25 within KIAA0040 gene while the second best novel hit was rs1869324 (p=4.71 × 10(-7)) at 2q22.1 within THSD7B. The third novel locus was NRD1 at 1p32.2 (the top SNP was rs2842576 with p=7.90 × 10(-6)). We confirmed the association of PKNOX2 at 11q24.4 with alcohol dependence. The top hit of PKNOX2 (rs750338 with p=1.47 × 10(-6)) in the meta-analysis was replicated with the Australian Twin-Family Study of 778 families (p=1.39 × 10(-2)) Furthermore, several flanking SNPs of the top hits in the meta-analysis demonstrated borderline associations with alcohol dependence in the family sample (top SNPs were rs2269655, rs856613, and rs10496768 with p=4.58 × 10(-3), 2.1 × 10(-4), and 2.86 × 10(-3) for KIAA0040, NRD1 and THSD7B, respectively). In addition, ALK, CASC4, and SEMA5A were strongly associated with alcohol dependence (p<2 × 10(-5)) in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, we identified three new loci (KIAA0040, THSD7B and NRD1) and confirmed the previous association of PKNOX2 with alcohol dependence. These findings offer the potential for new insights into the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence.	
21700265	Complement receptor 1 gene variants are associated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate.	The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a commonly performed test of the acute phase response, is the rate at which erythrocytes sediment in vitro in 1 hr. The molecular basis of erythrocyte sedimentation is unknown. To identify genetic variants associated with ESR, we carried out a genome-wide association study of 7607 patients in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The discovery cohort consisted of 1979 individuals from the Mayo Clinic, and the replication cohort consisted of 5628 individuals from the remaining four eMERGE sites. A nonsynonymous SNP, rs6691117 (Val→IIe), in the complement receptor 1 gene (CR1) was associated with ESR (discovery cohort p = 7 × 10(-12), replication cohort p = 3 × 10(-14), combined cohort p = 9 × 10(-24)). We imputed 61 SNPs in CR1, and a "possibly damaging" SNP (rs2274567, His→Arg) in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.74) with rs6691117 was also associated with ESR (discovery p = 5 × 10(-11), replication p = 7 × 10(-17), and combined cohort p = 2 × 10(-25)). The two nonsynonymous SNPs in CR1 are near the C3b/C4b binding site, suggesting a possible mechanism by which the variants may influence ESR. In conclusion, genetic variation in CR1, which encodes a protein that clears complement-tagged inflammatory particles from the circulation, influences interindividual variation in ESR, highlighting an association between the innate immunity pathway and erythrocyte interactions.	 19136662 20439480 19004497 6851436 15578041 18954261 1829116 15070788 20861458 19715440 19874218 21234875 3663946 16001361 16360013 20927387 20354512 11414353 21269473 19734903 18028942 14694201 16133175 18684861 10524488 20855594 17701901 14687939 12397357 3954279 11070059 9971870 2371562 8622941 16809394 20208533

21701570	Genome-wide association of BMI in African Americans.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple novel loci associated with obesity in Europeans but results in other ethnicities are less convincing. Here, we report a two-stage GWAS of BMI in African Americans. The GWAS was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform in 816 nondiabetic and 899 diabetic nephropathy subjects. 746,626 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with BMI after adjustment for age, gender, disease status, and population structure. Sixty high scoring SNPs that showed nominal association in both GWAS cohorts were further replicated in 3,274 additional subjects in four replication cohorts and a meta-analysis was computed. Meta-analysis of 4,989 subjects revealed five SNPs (rs6794092, rs268972, rs2033195, rs815611, and rs6088887) at four loci showing consistent associations in both GWAS (P < 0.0001) and replication cohorts (P < 0.05) with combined P values range from 2.4 × 10(-6) to 5 × 10(-5). These loci are located near PP13439-TMEM212, CDH12, MFAP3-GALNT10, and FER1L4 and had effect sizes between 0.091 and 0.167 s.d. unit (or 0.67-1.24 kg/m(2)) of BMI for each copy of the effect allele. Our findings suggest the presence of novel loci potentially associated with adiposity in African Americans. Further replication and meta-analysis in African Americans and other populations will shed light on the role of these loci in different ethnic populations.	 12181381 20935630 12499305 12684185 15018805 8680609 8923163 9545414 16138910 16804067 17434869 17496892 18159244 18193043 18193044 18335027 17658951 18454146 18454148 18599522 19079260 19079261 19151714 19396169 19322589 19265794 19557161 19557197 19567477 19851340 20071471 20182623 20215397 20502638 20400458 20699357 20186134 20379142 20935629 12365955
21700618	Genome-wide association study identifies novel alleles associated with risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.	We conducted a genome-wide association study on cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) among 2045 cases and 6013 controls of European ancestry, with follow-up replication in 1426 cases and 4845 controls. A non-synonymous SNP in the MC1R gene (rs1805007 encoding Arg151Cys substitution), a previously well-documented pigmentation gene, showed the strongest association with BCC risk in the discovery set (rs1805007[T]: OR (95% CI) for combined discovery set and replication set [1.55 (1.45-1.66); P= 4.3 × 10(-17)]. We identified that an SNP rs12210050 at 6p25 near the EXOC2 gene was associated with an increased risk of BCC [rs12210050[T]: combined OR (95% CI), 1.24 (1.17-1.31); P= 9.9 × 10(-10)]. In the locus on 13q32 near the UBAC2 gene encoding ubiquitin-associated domain-containing protein 2, we also identified a variant conferring susceptibility to BCC [rs7335046 [G]; combined OR (95% CI), 1.26 (1.18-1.34); P= 2.9 × 10(-8)]. We further evaluated the associations of these two novel SNPs (rs12210050 and rs7335046) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) risk as well as melanoma risk. We found that both variants, rs12210050[T] [OR (95% CI), 1.35 (1.16-1.57); P= 7.6 × 10(-5)] and rs7335046 [G] [OR (95% CI), 1.21 (1.02-1.44); P= 0.03], were associated with an increased risk of SCC. These two variants were not associated with melanoma risk. We conclude that 6p25 and 13q32 are novel loci conferring susceptibility to non-melanoma skin cancer.	 19578363 19442274 19365863 21058334 10631149 11179997 11254446 11511307 12111919 3962971 1669486 8176018 8894704 16862161 16721784 16943234 17529973 17952075 18483556 18488027 18813320 18849993 19151717 19340012
21738487	Web-based genome-wide association study identifies two novel loci and a substantial genetic component for Parkinson's disease.	Although the causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) are thought to be primarily environmental, recent studies suggest that a number of genes influence susceptibility. Using targeted case recruitment and online survey instruments, we conducted the largest case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD based on a single collection of individuals to date (3,426 cases and 29,624 controls). We discovered two novel, genome-wide significant associations with PD-rs6812193 near SCARB2 (p = 7.6 × 10(-10), OR = 0.84) and rs11868035 near SREBF1/RAI1 (p = 5.6 × 10(-8), OR = 0.85)-both replicated in an independent cohort. We also replicated 20 previously discovered genetic associations (including LRRK2, GBA, SNCA, MAPT, GAK, and the HLA region), providing support for our novel study design. Relying on a recently proposed method based on genome-wide sharing estimates between distantly related individuals, we estimated the heritability of PD to be at least 0.27. Finally, using sparse regression techniques, we constructed predictive models that account for 6%-7% of the total variance in liability and that suggest the presence of true associations just beyond genome-wide significance, as confirmed through both internal and external cross-validation. These results indicate a substantial, but by no means total, contribution of genetics underlying susceptibility to both early-onset and late-onset PD, suggesting that, despite the novel associations discovered here and elsewhere, the majority of the genetic component for Parkinson's disease remains to be discovered.	 18985386 15789306 19966780 17309939 12930761 19474294 16964263 20585627 20562875 16917932 18654633 8402897 20837857 20842684 12446870 20010215 20203693 20842689 8824319 19915575 9560156 17898028 17485642 18612128 19915576 10938284 9197268 11354627 14593171 19826454 20087877 21376301 15087508 9150132 12925569 9929087 20711177 12652298 10792055 17116639 17052657 15525722 20195508 20160189 21044948 20018015 20634204 21084426 20070850 21292315 12145550 7605419 18022370 21034428 21167468 19409267 16543934 18539534 19846850 19924712 11114315 19571811 15541309 10319879 18987351 12020270 18308289 15541308 15277625
21706003	Genetic variation near IRS1 associates with reduced adiposity and an impaired metabolic profile.	Genome-wide association studies have identified 32 loci influencing body mass index, but this measure does not distinguish lean from fat mass. To identify adiposity loci, we meta-analyzed associations between ∼2.5 million SNPs and body fat percentage from 36,626 individuals and followed up the 14 most significant (P < 10(-6)) independent loci in 39,576 individuals. We confirmed a previously established adiposity locus in FTO (P = 3 × 10(-26)) and identified two new loci associated with body fat percentage, one near IRS1 (P = 4 × 10(-11)) and one near SPRY2 (P = 3 × 10(-8)). Both loci contain genes with potential links to adipocyte physiology. Notably, the body-fat-decreasing allele near IRS1 is associated with decreased IRS1 expression and with an impaired metabolic profile, including an increased visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, risk of diabetes and coronary artery disease and decreased adiponectin levels. Our findings provide new insights into adiposity and insulin resistance.	 11259600 11279012 11731797 11921432 12502742 14966273 15122328 7969452 20935630 9204876 9325314 9368055 9519560 10320049 10480510 15653567 16847701 17498506 17434869 17572673 17634449 17676998 17717599 17982457 17701901 20346437 19734900 19779445 19557197 19557161 19151714 19079261 19079260 18816166 18454148 18454146 17658951 11234459 11133069 10741566 18219583 18344981 20935629 20886378 20634204 20410440 20686565 20363877 20421936 7526222
21706340	A unique genome-wide association analysis in extended Utah high-risk pedigrees identifies a novel melanoma risk variant on chromosome arm 10q.	Only two genome-wide association (GWA) screens have been published for melanoma (Nat Genet 47:920-925, 2009; Nat Genet 40:838-840, 2008). Using a unique approach, we performed a genome-wide association study in 156 related melanoma cases from 34 high-risk Utah pedigrees. Genome-wide association analysis was performed on nearly 500,000 markers; we compared cases to 2,150 genotypically matched samples from Illumina's iControls database. We performed genome-wide association with EMMAX software, which is designed to account for population structure, including relatedness between cases. Three SNPs exceeded a genome-wide significance threshold of p < 5 × 10(-8) on chromosome arm 10q25.1 (rs17119434, rs17119461, and rs17119490), where the most extreme p value was 7.21 × 10(-12). This study represents a new and unique approach to predisposition gene identification; and it is the first genome-wide association study performed in related cases in high-risk pedigrees. Our approach illustrates an example of using high-risk pedigrees for the identification of new melanoma predisposition variants.	 11315092 18596976 18488026 9875838 19578365 18200594 18986335 20546537 7987388 16532393 7923152 17001621 15297300 18093282 19578364 20548291 17701901 16368560 16228001 17924335 20821337 11855950 20208533
21708048	Genome wide association study identifies KCNMA1 contributing to human obesity.	Recent genome-wide association (GWA) analyses have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with obesity. However, the reported genetic variation in obesity explains only a minor fraction of the total genetic variation expected to be present in the population. Thus many genetic variants controlling obesity remain to be identified. The aim of this study was to use GWA followed by multiple stepwise validations to identify additional genes associated with obesity.	 1855495 18942098 15937479 16150380 16614226 17434869 17554300 17701901 18159244 18091355 18252159 18071343 18454148 18325910 18454136 18381574 18682847 18698412 18704987 18626482 18854754 19079260 19079261 19151714 4370663 19174833 19234441 19228371 19680540 19553259 20054225 19966786 20130649 20421936 20110568 20724581 20935630 20717167 15685248
21740922	A genome-wide association study confirms APOE as the major gene influencing survival in long-lived individuals.	We conducted a case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human longevity, comparing 664,472 autosomal SNPs in 763 long-lived individuals (LLI; mean age: 99.7 years) and 1085 controls (mean age: 60.2 years) from Germany. Only one association, namely that of SNP rs4420638 near the APOC1 gene, achieved genome-wide significance (allele-based P=1.8×10(-10)). However, logistic regression analysis revealed that this association, which was replicated in an independent German sample, is fully explicable by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE allele ɛ4, the only variant hitherto established as a major genetic determinant of survival into old age. Our GWAS failed to identify any additional autosomal susceptibility genes. One explanation for this lack of success in our study would be that GWAS provide only limited statistical power for a polygenic phenotype with loci of small effect such as human longevity. A recent GWAS in Dutch LLI independently confirmed the APOE-longevity association, thus strengthening the conclusion that this locus is a very, if not the most, important genetic factor influencing longevity.	
21738491	Identification of a sudden cardiac death susceptibility locus at 2q24.2 through genome-wide association in European ancestry individuals.	Sudden cardiac death (SCD) continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with an annual incidence estimated at 250,000-300,000 in the United States and with the vast majority occurring in the setting of coronary disease. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis in 1,283 SCD cases and >20,000 control individuals of European ancestry from 5 studies, with follow-up genotyping in up to 3,119 SCD cases and 11,146 controls from 11 European ancestry studies, and identify the BAZ2B locus as associated with SCD (P = 1.8×10(-10)). The risk allele, while ancestral, has a frequency of ~1.4%, suggesting strong negative selection and increases risk for SCD by 1.92-fold per allele (95% CI 1.57-2.34). We also tested the role of 49 SNPs previously implicated in modulating electrocardiographic traits (QRS, QT, and RR intervals). Consistent with epidemiological studies showing increased risk of SCD with prolonged QRS/QT intervals, the interval-prolonging alleles are in aggregate associated with increased risk for SCD (P = 0.006).	 21068316 17701901 21076409 21147730 21527156 15364331 10662543 11315092 11334841 11794197 11947916 12695299 12932596 7055867 2646917 2148709 1669507 9362408 10081519 10209001 16412861 17924335 18348202 19026856 19171855 19204306 19305408 19305409 19728115 20622880 20639392 20981092 16828632 16940195 17000909 17694091 21058334
21738484	Genome-wide association of bipolar disorder suggests an enrichment of replicable associations in regions near genes.	Although a highly heritable and disabling disease, bipolar disorder's (BD) genetic variants have been challenging to identify. We present new genotype data for 1,190 cases and 401 controls and perform a genome-wide association study including additional samples for a total of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. We do not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, across all SNPs, we show an association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous genome-wide association study and evidence for replication (P = 1.5×10(-7)). To demonstrate that this result is not likely to be a false positive, we analyze replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and show that, in a large enough study, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies and, further, provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies.	 17725844 17701901 18722519 18974833 18711365 19088739 19416921 19474294 19488044 19571811 19715440 19358880 20081856 20126254 20562874 20562875 20647212 20881960 20935629 20935630 21194676 12883005 8630482 17554300 17695343 17486107
21738479	Genome-wide association study of white blood cell count in 16,388 African Americans: the continental origins and genetic epidemiology network (COGENT).	Total white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts are lower among individuals of African descent due to the common African-derived "null" variant of the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) gene. Additional common genetic polymorphisms were recently associated with total WBC and WBC sub-type levels in European and Japanese populations. No additional loci that account for WBC variability have been identified in African Americans. In order to address this, we performed a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of total WBC and cell subtype counts in 16,388 African-American participants from 7 population-based cohorts available in the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network. In addition to the DARC locus on chromosome 1q23, we identified two other regions (chromosomes 4q13 and 16q22) associated with WBC in African Americans (P<2.5×10(-8)). The lead SNP (rs9131) on chromosome 4q13 is located in the CXCL2 gene, which encodes a chemotactic cytokine for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Independent evidence of the novel CXCL2 association with WBC was present in 3,551 Hispanic Americans, 14,767 Japanese, and 19,509 European Americans. The index SNP (rs12149261) on chromosome 16q22 associated with WBC count is located in a large inter-chromosomal segmental duplication encompassing part of the hydrocephalus inducing homolog (HYDIN) gene. We demonstrate that the chromosome 16q22 association finding is most likely due to a genotyping artifact as a consequence of sequence similarity between duplicated regions on chromosomes 16q22 and 1q21. Among the WBC loci recently identified in European or Japanese populations, replication was observed in our African-American meta-analysis for rs445 of CDK6 on chromosome 7q21 and rs4065321 of PSMD3-CSF3 region on chromosome 17q21. In summary, the CXCL2, CDK6, and PSMD3-CSF3 regions are associated with WBC count in African American and other populations. We also demonstrate that large inter-chromosomal duplications can result in false positive associations in GWAS.	 17114483 21169375 17404350 17431401 17701901 17855830 17928531 18179887 18182579 18348202 18435972 18621010 18523146 18794853 19029900 19060902 19118300 19180233 19198610 10723803 10961863 11340251 12387736 778616 463924 4054596 3802833 7689250 15782774 16773560 16934002 16938426 8229103 8114739 7699323 10385477 15767524 19343178 19499525 19543370 19820697 20085711 20040588 20061440 20139978 20194862 20395969 20185584 20172861 20040767 20516641 20616382 20838612 20860503 20881960 20839287 21153663 17133093
21738478	Identification of nine novel loci associated with white blood cell subtypes in a Japanese population.	White blood cells (WBCs) mediate immune systems and consist of various subtypes with distinct roles. Elucidation of the mechanism that regulates the counts of the WBC subtypes would provide useful insights into both the etiology of the immune system and disease pathogenesis. In this study, we report results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a replication study for the counts of the 5 main WBC subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) using 14,792 Japanese subjects enrolled in the BioBank Japan Project. We identified 12 significantly associated loci that satisfied the genome-wide significance threshold of P<5.0×10(-8), of which 9 loci were novel (the CDK6 locus for the neutrophil count; the ITGA4, MLZE, STXBP6 loci, and the MHC region for the monocyte count; the SLC45A3-NUCKS1, GATA2, NAALAD2, ERG loci for the basophil count). We further evaluated associations in the identified loci using 15,600 subjects from Caucasian populations. These WBC subtype-related loci demonstrated a variety of patterns of pleiotropic associations within the WBC subtypes, or with total WBC count, platelet count, or red blood cell-related traits (n = 30,454), which suggests unique and common functional roles of these loci in the processes of hematopoiesis. This study should contribute to the understanding of the genetic backgrounds of the WBC subtypes and hematological traits.	 10723803 11196672 11315092 12145319 12234367 12510047 14685227 8507862 13376429 16862161 16998491 17160644 17350798 17701901 17767157 17982410 18500345 18817904 18974171 19110211 19144314 19198610 19153533 19221038 19387026 19649210 19528534 19622087 19820699 19862010 19853236 20031568 20045101 20139978 20118910 20172861 20189936 20453842 20562875 20628149 21085203 21083439 21196492 21738480 19715440 19820697 19820698
21738480	Multiple loci are associated with white blood cell phenotypes.	White blood cell (WBC) count is a common clinical measure from complete blood count assays, and it varies widely among healthy individuals. Total WBC count and its constituent subtypes have been shown to be moderately heritable, with the heritability estimates varying across cell types. We studied 19,509 subjects from seven cohorts in a discovery analysis, and 11,823 subjects from ten cohorts for replication analyses, to determine genetic factors influencing variability within the normal hematological range for total WBC count and five WBC subtype measures. Cohort specific data was supplied by the CHARGE, HeamGen, and INGI consortia, as well as independent collaborative studies. We identified and replicated ten associations with total WBC count and five WBC subtypes at seven different genomic loci (total WBC count-6p21 in the HLA region, 17q21 near ORMDL3, and CSF3; neutrophil count-17q21; basophil count- 3p21 near RPN1 and C3orf27; lymphocyte count-6p21, 19p13 at EPS15L1; monocyte count-2q31 at ITGA4, 3q21, 8q24 an intergenic region, 9q31 near EDG2), including three previously reported associations and seven novel associations. To investigate functional relationships among variants contributing to variability in the six WBC traits, we utilized gene expression- and pathways-based analyses. We implemented gene-clustering algorithms to evaluate functional connectivity among implicated loci and showed functional relationships across cell types. Gene expression data from whole blood was utilized to show that significant biological consequences can be extracted from our genome-wide analyses, with effect estimates for significant loci from the meta-analyses being highly corellated with the proximal gene expression. In addition, collaborative efforts between the groups contributing to this study and related studies conducted by the COGENT and RIKEN groups allowed for the examination of effect homogeneity for genome-wide significant associations across populations of diverse ancestral backgrounds.	 17401366 4046122 19474294 11223329 21263130 17481443 21037568 18464913 20041166 18264096 17529967 20031568 19853236 20852632 1442716 19923232 19578367 21242260 20190752 19169254 19767754 20526339 17655857 20676098 4827627 17611496 11795665 20694011 19525955 19656524 18364390 20881960 20972438 9600484 18219369 14609588 3484805 18179887 20616382 20062064 11590089 20172861 21102463 9160668 18852200 17395743 16494531 17401363 19820697 19557189 15542275 18264097 19862010 20348956 19767753 1378318 16934002 12656674 17618283 17618284 19270707 16432087 18794855 20453838 20139978 19525953 17701901 20436469 18021893 18372905 19198610 17908163 19620980 18372901 19115949 15780773 19180233 20205591 15288155 18095095 14702636 7738198 18369459

21725309	Variation in the DEPDC5 locus is associated with progression to hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C virus carriers.	Chronic viral hepatitis is the most important risk factor for progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To identify genetic risk factors for progression to HCC in individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), we analyzed 467,538 SNPs in 212 Japanese individuals with chronic HCV with HCC and 765 individuals with chronic HCV without HCC. We identified one intronic SNP in the DEPDC5 locus on chromosome 22 associated with HCC risk and confirmed the association using an independent case-control population (710 cases and 1,625 controls). The association was highly significant when we analyzed the stages separately as well as together (rs1012068, P(combined) = 1.27 × 10(-13), odds ratio = 1.75). The significance level of the association further increased after adjustment for gender, age and platelet count (P = 1.35 × 10(-14), odds ratio = 1.96). Our findings suggest that common variants within the DEPDC5 locus affect susceptibility to HCC in Japanese individuals with chronic HCV infection.	 11501945 12297848 20587513 3663825 19173277 9630596 19434718 11583749 9181529 20818381 18648742 20596605 12883497 20628345 15297300 7533121 18817904 15770670 20676096 18477402 17701901 15508082 19220670 18348202 16969503 10428733 17452976 11721762
21725308	A genome-wide association study identifies two new lung cancer susceptibility loci at 13q12.12 and 22q12.2 in Han Chinese.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To identify genetic factors that modify the risk of lung cancer in individuals of Chinese ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association scan in 5,408 subjects (2,331 individuals with lung cancer (cases) and 3,077 controls) followed by a two-stage validation among 12,722 subjects (6,313 cases and 6,409 controls). The combined analyses identified six well-replicated SNPs with independent effects and significant lung cancer associations (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) located in TP63 (rs4488809 at 3q28, P = 7.2 × 10(-26)), TERT-CLPTM1L (rs465498 and rs2736100 at 5p15.33, P = 1.2 × 10(-20) and P = 1.0 × 10(-27), respectively), MIPEP-TNFRSF19 (rs753955 at 13q12.12, P = 1.5 × 10(-12)) and MTMR3-HORMAD2-LIF (rs17728461 and rs36600 at 22q12.2, P = 1.1 × 10(-11) and P = 6.2 × 10(-13), respectively). Two of these loci (13q12.12 and 22q12.2) were newly identified in the Chinese population. These results suggest that genetic variants in 3q28, 5p15.33, 13q12.12 and 22q12.2 may contribute to the susceptibility of lung cancer in Han Chinese.	 20871597 21131975 16862161 19851315 10809768 18385676 18978787 20231684 20554746 20512145 18978790 18385738 15297300 11162647 18385739 12856737 20548021 19571885 17701901 18407370 17589521 19541747 20959490 19491260 11254454 19654303 19836008 10783257
21729881	Genome-wide association study identifies common variants associated with circulating vitamin E levels.	In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common genetic variants associated with circulating alpha- and gamma-tocopherol concentrations in two adult cohorts comprising 5006 men of European descent, we observed three loci associated with alpha-tocopherol levels, two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2108622 on 19pter-p13.11 (P= 1.7 × 10(-8)) and rs11057830 on 12q24.31 (P= 2.0 × 10(-8)) and confirmed a previously reported locus marked by rs964184 on 11q23.3 (P= 2.7 × 10(-10)). The three SNPs have been reported to be associated with lipid metabolism and/or regulation. We replicated these findings in a combined meta-analysis with two independent samples, P= 7.8 × 10(-12) (rs964184 on 11q23.3 near BUD13, ZNF259 and APOA1/C3/A4/A5), P= 1.4 × 10(-10) (rs2108622 on 19pter-p13.11 near CYP4F2) and P= 8.2 × 10(-9) (rs11057830 on 12q24.31 near SCARB1). Combined, these SNPs explain 1.7% of the residual variance in log alpha-tocopherol levels. In one of the two male GWAS cohorts (n= 992), no SNPs were significantly associated with gamma-tocopherol concentrations after including data from the replication sample for 71 independent SNPs with P< 1 × 10(-4) identified.	 18193044 21131975 18776911 11997390 18193043 7719340 17193899 19276229 10479466 2496857 20923562 6327876 20686565 8205268 15769967 7580706 21041806 20160193 18029479 20418485 20696139 10397692 19185284 11074077 16054167 12453956 9200147 3084131 9481124 11837994 19060906 18193046 18433732 8736173 9576851 19066370 19060910 19297519 20861217 4818200 20833655
21732829	Wnt signaling and Dupuytren's disease.	Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibromatosis of the hands and fingers that leads to flexion contractures. We hypothesized that multiple genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to this disease and sought to identify susceptibility genes to better understand its pathogenesis.	
21750679	Genome-wide scan identifies TNIP1, PSORS1C1, and RHOB as novel risk loci for systemic sclerosis.	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an orphan, complex, inflammatory disease affecting the immune system and connective tissue. SSc stands out as a severely incapacitating and life-threatening inflammatory rheumatic disease, with a largely unknown pathogenesis. We have designed a two-stage genome-wide association study of SSc using case-control samples from France, Italy, Germany, and Northern Europe. The initial genome-wide scan was conducted in a French post quality-control sample of 564 cases and 1,776 controls, using almost 500 K SNPs. Two SNPs from the MHC region, together with the 6 loci outside MHC having at least one SNP with a P<10(-5) were selected for follow-up analysis. These markers were genotyped in a post-QC replication sample of 1,682 SSc cases and 3,926 controls. The three top SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium and located on 6p21, in the HLA-DQB1 gene: rs9275224, P = 9.18×10(-8), OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.60-0.79]; rs6457617, P = 1.14×10(-7) and rs9275245, P = 1.39×10(-7). Within the MHC region, the next most associated SNP (rs3130573, P = 1.86×10(-5), OR = 1.36 [1.18-1.56]) is located in the PSORS1C1 gene. Outside the MHC region, our GWAS analysis revealed 7 top SNPs (P<10(-5)) that spanned 6 independent genomic regions. Follow-up of the 17 top SNPs in an independent sample of 1,682 SSc and 3,926 controls showed associations at PSORS1C1 (overall P = 5.70×10(-10), OR:1.25), TNIP1 (P = 4.68×10(-9), OR:1.31), and RHOB loci (P = 3.17×10(-6), OR:1.21). Because of its biological relevance, and previous reports of genetic association at this locus with connective tissue disorders, we investigated TNIP1 expression. A markedly reduced expression of the TNIP1 gene and also its protein product were observed both in lesional skin tissue and in cultured dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients. Furthermore, TNIP1 showed in vitro inhibitory effects on inflammatory cytokine-induced collagen production. The genetic signal of association with TNIP1 variants, together with tissular and cellular investigations, suggests that this pathway has a critical role in regulating autoimmunity and SSc pathogenesis.	 11407695 20511617 12233880 12473275 12847690 14598854 15258597 15213329 15334086 7378088 3361530 15297300 16032514 15870151 16396698 17195235 17332883 17530646 17701901 18035321 18369457 18606306 18975312 19116937 19169254 19420368 19286670 19479858 19644887 19734903 19838193 19838195 19878776 19950257 19950302 19633559 20039427 19596691 20383147 20616736 12029063
21743057	Genome-wide association study identifies new prostate cancer susceptibility loci.	Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most common non-skin cancer diagnosed among males in developed countries and the second leading cause of cancer mortality, yet little is known regarding its etiology and factors that influence clinical outcome. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PrCa have identified at least 30 distinct loci associated with small differences in risk. We conducted a GWAS in 2782 advanced PrCa cases (Gleason grade ≥ 8 or tumor stage C/D) and 4458 controls with 571 243 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Based on in silico replication of 4679 SNPs (Stage 1, P < 0.02) in two published GWAS with 7358 PrCa cases and 6732 controls, we identified a new susceptibility locus associated with overall PrCa risk at 2q37.3 (rs2292884, P= 4.3 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed a locus suggested by an earlier GWAS at 12q13 (rs902774, P= 8.6 × 10(-9)). The estimated per-allele odds ratios for these loci (1.14 for rs2292884 and 1.17 for rs902774) did not differ between advanced and non-advanced PrCa (case-only test for heterogeneity P= 0.72 and P= 0.61, respectively). Further studies will be needed to assess whether these or other loci are differentially associated with PrCa subtypes.	 10825281 19767755 11781324 12563560 12642065 12897212 14601026 15870412 15888698 16173044 16682969 17401363 17401366 17603485 18073375 18264096 18264097 18264098 18375899 18758462 18852200 19117981 19165914 19318570 19383797 19505914 19767752 19767753 19767754 20080650 20086100 20406958 20562874 20676098 20877320 21390317 21531787 10891514
21743467	Seven prostate cancer susceptibility loci identified by a multi-stage genome-wide association study.	Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer in developed countries. We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study for PrCa and previously reported the results of the first two stages, which identified 16 PrCa susceptibility loci. We report here the results of stage 3, in which we evaluated 1,536 SNPs in 4,574 individuals with prostate cancer (cases) and 4,164 controls. We followed up ten new association signals through genotyping in 51,311 samples in 30 studies from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium. In addition to replicating previously reported loci, we identified seven new prostate cancer susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2p11, 3q23, 3q26, 5p12, 6p21, 12q13 and Xq12 (P = 4.0 × 10(-8) to P = 2.7 × 10(-24)). We also identified a SNP in TERT more strongly associated with PrCa than that previously reported. More than 40 PrCa susceptibility loci, explaining ∼25% of the familial risk in this disease, have now been identified.	 10951499 12709289 12909641 15208658 10409514 16141233 16354688 17384015 17572673 18264097 18391951 18375381 18768501 19151717 19343178 19551138 19767752 19767753 20233392 20418093 20562874 21207418
21743469	Interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-B27 in ankylosing spondylitis implicates peptide handling in the mechanism for HLA-B27 in disease susceptibility.	Ankylosing spondylitis is a common form of inflammatory arthritis predominantly affecting the spine and pelvis that occurs in approximately 5 out of 1,000 adults of European descent. Here we report the identification of three variants in the RUNX3, LTBR-TNFRSF1A and IL12B regions convincingly associated with ankylosing spondylitis (P < 5 × 10(-8) in the combined discovery and replication datasets) and a further four loci at PTGER4, TBKBP1, ANTXR2 and CARD9 that show strong association across all our datasets (P < 5 × 10(-6) overall, with support in each of the three datasets studied). We also show that polymorphisms of ERAP1, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase involved in peptide trimming before HLA class I presentation, only affect ankylosing spondylitis risk in HLA-B27-positive individuals. These findings provide strong evidence that HLA-B27 operates in ankylosing spondylitis through a mechanism involving aberrant processing of antigenic peptides.	 7761976 18415769 20062062 18250193 17068223 11053066 17846035 17447842 19273449 19169255 6231933 19715440 6606472 12189246 19763151 20045101 17236132 17227914 19812545 20463747 3468804 18500230 19479869 16386647 6606431 8733445 16286653 20953190 19854717 12436109 16249228 9952031 18467348 21044948 21152001 12748171 17701901 9336417 2301392 20807707 17952073 7489765 20118929 19638272 19455231 19543373 14662887
21750109	European genome-wide association study identifies SLC14A1 as a new urinary bladder cancer susceptibility gene.	Three genome-wide association studies in Europe and the USA have reported eight urinary bladder cancer (UBC) susceptibility loci. Using extended case and control series and 1000 Genomes imputations of 5 340 737 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we searched for additional loci in the European GWAS. The discovery sample set consisted of 1631 cases and 3822 controls from the Netherlands and 603 cases and 37 781 controls from Iceland. For follow-up, we used 3790 cases and 7507 controls from 13 sample sets of European and Iranian ancestry. Based on the discovery analysis, we followed up signals in the urea transporter (UT) gene SLC14A. The strongest signal at this locus was represented by a SNP in intron 3, rs17674580, that reached genome-wide significance in the overall analysis of the discovery and follow-up groups: odds ratio = 1.17, P = 7.6 × 10(-11). SLC14A1 codes for UTs that define the Kidd blood group and are crucial for the maintenance of a constant urea concentration gradient in the renal medulla and, through this, the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. It is speculated that rs17674580, or other sequence variants in LD with it, indirectly modifies UBC risk by affecting urine production. If confirmed, this would support the 'urogenous contact hypothesis' that urine production and voiding frequency modify the risk of UBC.	 16284380 16255080 16737809 16501254 17572673 17684133 17568781 18385739 18569590 18562223 18794855 19028811 19151717 19369583 19219610 19271220 19543373 19648920 19734901 20016592 20139978 20083643 20348956 19801959 20686651 20972438 20981099 21063684 21051319 21081471 21351269 20715171 21459758 21449978 17012270 10640821 11857419 11792714 12111919 12469123 12775276 14517540 14652287 15173019 3469457 3470801 1868460 1498276 9215669 9541867 10228189 15886698 15630470 16112301 16380991
21750111	A genome-wide association study of chronic hepatitis B identified novel risk locus in a Japanese population.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health issue worldwide which may lead to hepatic dysfunction, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To identify host genetic factors that are associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) susceptibility, we previously conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified the association of HLA-DP variants with CHB in Asians; however, only 179 cases and 934 controls were genotyped using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Here, we performed a second GWAS of 519 747 SNPs in 458 Japanese CHB cases and 2056 controls. After adjustment with the previously identified variants in the HLA-DP locus (rs9277535), we detected strong associations at 16 loci with P-value of <5 × 10(-5). We analyzed these loci in three independent Japanese cohorts (2209 CHB cases and 4440 controls) and found significant association of two SNPs (rs2856718 and rs7453920) within the HLA-DQ locus (overall P-value of 5.98 × 10(-28) and 3.99 × 10(-37)). Association of CHB with SNPs rs2856718 and rs7453920 remains significant even after stratification with rs3077 and rs9277535, indicating independent effect of HLA-DQ variants on CHB susceptibility (P-value of 1.52 × 10(-21)- 2.38 × 10(-30)). Subsequent analyses revealed DQA1*0102-DQB1*0604 and DQA1*0101-DQB1*0501 [odds ratios (OR) =0.16, and 0.39, respectively] as protective haplotypes and DQA1*0102-DQB1*0303 and DQA1*0301-DQB1*0601 (OR = 19.03 and 5.02, respectively) as risk haplotypes. These findings indicated that variants in antigen-binding regions of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ contribute to the risk of persistent HBV infection.	
21784300	Genome-wide association study of the child behavior checklist dysregulation profile.	A potentially useful tool for understanding the distribution and determinants of emotional dysregulation in children is a Child Behavior Checklist profile, comprising the Attention Problems, Anxious/Depressed, and Aggressive Behavior clinical subscales (CBCL-DP). The CBCL-DP indexes a heritable trait that increases susceptibility for later psychopathology, including severe mood problems and aggressive behavior. We have conducted a genome-wide association study of the CBCL-DP in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	 9556027 10631157 20157312 18724256 19389330 2018156 12842233 16950211 19232020 12499305 20368705 12140781 17924339 19187442 18300295 18086710 19019849 19459784 8402908 19193231 20510462 16650832 8824323 19486226 15902206 18988193 19927149 16135619 16239161 18728693 18632161 12734009 17487225 20421462 12880507 20468056 11227071 10737605 19243016 10102726 20732626 21123313 15950197 18923512 12528186 20868653 15337662 17701901 18348202 20970698 20877300 19131956 20410730 9915965 16339028 17329112 21215389 19826618
21779181	Identification of novel genetic markers associated with clinical phenotypes of systemic sclerosis through a genome-wide association strategy.	The aim of this study was to determine, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), the genetic components contributing to different clinical sub-phenotypes of systemic sclerosis (SSc). We considered limited (lcSSc) and diffuse (dcSSc) cutaneous involvement, and the relationships with presence of the SSc-specific auto-antibodies, anti-centromere (ACA), and anti-topoisomerase I (ATA). Four GWAS cohorts, comprising 2,296 SSc patients and 5,171 healthy controls, were meta-analyzed looking for associations in the selected subgroups. Eighteen polymorphisms were further tested in nine independent cohorts comprising an additional 3,175 SSc patients and 4,971 controls. Conditional analysis for associated SNPs in the HLA region was performed to explore their independent association in antibody subgroups. Overall analysis showed that non-HLA polymorphism rs11642873 in IRF8 gene to be associated at GWAS level with lcSSc (P = 2.32×10(-12), OR = 0.75). Also, rs12540874 in GRB10 gene (P = 1.27 × 10(-6), OR = 1.15) and rs11047102 in SOX5 gene (P = 1.39×10(-7), OR = 1.36) showed a suggestive association with lcSSc and ACA subgroups respectively. In the HLA region, we observed highly associated allelic combinations in the HLA-DQB1 locus with ACA (P = 1.79×10(-61), OR = 2.48), in the HLA-DPA1/B1 loci with ATA (P = 4.57×10(-76), OR = 8.84), and in NOTCH4 with ACA P = 8.84×10(-21), OR = 0.55) and ATA (P = 1.14×10(-8), OR = 0.54). We have identified three new non-HLA genes (IRF8, GRB10, and SOX5) associated with SSc clinical and auto-antibody subgroups. Within the HLA region, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1/B1, and NOTCH4 associations with SSc are likely confined to specific auto-antibodies. These data emphasize the differential genetic components of subphenotypes of SSc.	 16465656 16415888 17133608 17401363 17530643 17529973 17572673 17701901 17496152 18329529 18329530 18799728 19116937 19143814 19420368 19286670 19479858 19525953 19605749 19644887 19877059 19884273 19950302 20112391 19796918 19778912 20131239 19815934 19596691 20383147 20232315 20472592 20596022 20837696 21187296 21383967 16484229 16375605 11469464 11680692 12223098 12589427 14706971 14730600 7378088 3361530 2337105 8988890 9553107 15297300

21779176	Genome-wide association study identifies novel restless legs syndrome susceptibility loci on 2p14 and 16q12.1.	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder with an age-dependent prevalence of up to 10% in the general population above 65 years of age. Affected individuals suffer from uncomfortable sensations and an urge to move in the lower limbs that occurs mainly in resting situations during the evening or at night. Moving the legs or walking leads to an improvement of symptoms. Concomitantly, patients report sleep disturbances with consequences such as reduced daytime functioning. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWA) for RLS in 922 cases and 1,526 controls (using 301,406 SNPs) followed by a replication of 76 candidate SNPs in 3,935 cases and 5,754 controls, all of European ancestry. Herein, we identified six RLS susceptibility loci of genome-wide significance, two of them novel: an intergenic region on chromosome 2p14 (rs6747972, P = 9.03 × 10(-11), OR = 1.23) and a locus on 16q12.1 (rs3104767, P = 9.4 × 10(-19), OR = 1.35) in a linkage disequilibrium block of 140 kb containing the 5'-end of TOX3 and the adjacent non-coding RNA BC034767.	 10547834 11315092 19110211 17529967 19743755 20237344 16032514 16415888 21172805 17387144 14592341 18279518 18591388 18575924 18694974 17637780 19393249 17701901 19196971 18660810 15514657 17634447 18615093 19188922 20208533

21764829	A genome-wide association study of hepatitis B vaccine response in an Indonesian population reveals multiple independent risk variants in the HLA region.	We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of antibody titer in 3614 hepatitis B vaccine recipients from Indonesia's Riau Archipelago, leading to the identification of at least three independent signals within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. These appear to implicate HLA-DR [rs3135363; P= 6.53 × 10(-22); odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-1.74]; HLA-DP, previously associated with the risk of chronic hepatitis B infection (rs9277535; P= 2.91 × 10(-12); OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.63-0.81); and a gene rich HLA Class III interval (rs9267665; P = 1.24 × 10(-17); OR = 2.05, CI = 1.64-2.57). The substantial overlap of these variants and those identified by GWAS of chronic hepatitis B infection confirms vaccine response as a model for infection, while suggesting that the vaccine is least effective in those most at risk of lifelong infection, following exposure to the virus.	
21761138	Meta-analysis of new genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer risk.	Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified novel susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer. To follow up on these findings, and try to identify novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we present results for GWAS of colorectal cancer (2,906 cases, 3,416 controls) that have not previously published main associations. Specifically, we calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using log-additive models for each study. In order to improve our power to detect novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis combining the results across studies. We selected the most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for replication using ten independent studies (8,161 cases and 9,101 controls). We again used a meta-analysis to summarize results for the replication studies alone, and for a combined analysis of GWAS and replication studies. We measured ten SNPs previously identified in colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and found eight to be associated with colorectal cancer (p value range 0.02 to 1.8 × 10(-8)). When we excluded studies that have previously published on these SNPs, five SNPs remained significant at p < 0.05 in the combined analysis. No novel susceptibility loci were significant in the replication study after adjustment for multiple testing, and none reached genome-wide significance from a combined analysis of GWAS and replication. We observed marginally significant evidence for a second independent SNP in the BMP2 region at chromosomal location 20p12 (rs4813802; replication p value 0.03; combined p value 7.3 × 10(-5)). In a region on 5p33.15, which includes the coding regions of the TERT-CLPTM1L genes and has been identified in GWAS to be associated with susceptibility to at least seven other cancers, we observed a marginally significant association with rs2853668 (replication p value 0.03; combined p value 1.9 × 10(-4)). Our study suggests a complex nature of the contribution of common genetic variants to risk for colorectal cancer.	 17460686 20871597 12930761 20700438 17266119 15510158 16945910 20101243 19920125 10835412 11381269 17786212 17630503 21129217 20628624 16255080 18509313 11252892 11419946 19578367 18978787 17234637 15602012 18300295 16115824 20881960 18200594 19434079 21531788 16024819 18978790 24445293 19578363 19011631 20543847 19200528 17071714 20479773 11162647 8801636 12045093 17401363 19207020 20626350 19151717 15667510 17554300 19812666 20972440 20454541 17618283 17618284 20634204 17701901 9988278 17554299 18348202 18756288 18372905 17934461 20562874 18372901 19836008 21357381
21768215	Genome-wide association study for serum urate concentrations and gout among African Americans identifies genomic risk loci and a novel URAT1 loss-of-function allele.	Serum urate concentrations are highly heritable and elevated serum urate is a key risk factor for gout. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of serum urate in African American (AA) populations are lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS of serum urate levels and gout among 5820 AA and a large candidate gene study among 6890 AA and 21 708 participants of European ancestry (EA) within the Candidate Gene Association Resource Consortium. Findings were tested for replication among 1996 independent AA individuals, and evaluated for their association among 28 283 EA participants of the CHARGE Consortium. Functional studies were conducted using (14)C-urate transport assays in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the discovery GWAS of serum urate, three loci achieved genome-wide significance (P< 5.0 × 10(-8)): a novel locus near SGK1/SLC2A12 on chromosome 6 (rs9321453, P= 1.0 × 10(-9)), and two loci previously identified in EA participants, SLC2A9 (P= 3.8 × 10(-32)) and SLC22A12 (P= 2.1 × 10(-10)). A novel rare non-synonymous variant of large effect size in SLC22A12, rs12800450 (minor allele frequency 0.01, G65W), was identified and replicated (beta -1.19 mg/dl, P= 2.7 × 10(-16)). (14)C-urate transport assays showed reduced urate transport for the G65W URAT1 mutant. Finally, in analyses of 11 loci previously associated with serum urate in EA individuals, 10 of 11 lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed direction-consistent association with urate among AA. In summary, we identified and replicated one novel locus in association with serum urate levels and experimentally characterize the novel G65W variant in URAT1 as a functional allele. Our data support the importance of multi-ethnic GWAS in the identification of novel risk loci as well as functional variants.	 17701901 17554299 18327256 18327257 17997608 18701466 18946066 18842065 18974833 18834626 19160799 19089453 19503597 19506252 19609347 19643913 19808794 20031568 19692116 20040588 20139978 20184988 20193002 20354512 20368174 20209635 20400780 20686565 20616382 20981092 20884846 21118897 21153663 10835412 11832379 12024214 14655203 15088269 1208363 224699 3204420 2646917 1669507 7748218 8876844 9114008 14025561 14208728 16253630 16862161 17278930 17372189 18179892
21771975	A genome-wide association study reveals a quantitative trait locus of adiponectin on CDH13 that predicts cardiometabolic outcomes.	The plasma adiponectin level, a potential upstream and internal facet of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, has a reasonably high heritability. Whether other novel genes influence the variation in adiponectin level and the roles of these genetic variants on subsequent clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we aimed not only to identify genetic variants modulating plasma adiponectin levels but also to investigate whether these variants are associated with adiponectin-related metabolic traits and cardiovascular diseases.	 10601632 20876611 11326751 11344187 12086969 12376824 12802337 12871694 12882876 14624132 15082700 15123570 15210937 1978938 1347253 8673923 9615235 15692106 15821437 16169830 16437587 16505255 16514099 16823476 16901415 17554300 17535986 17701901 18828732 18842004 19165155 19286580 19389061 19584347 19883615 20011104 20018283 20178558 20887962 10982546
21771265	Genome-wide association study on bipolar disorder in the Bulgarian population.	Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Genetic studies have implicated many variants in the disease's etiology but only few have been successfully replicated. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on bipolar disorder in the Bulgarian population followed by a replication study of the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing the smallest P values. The GWAS was performed on 188 bipolar disorder patients and 376 control subjects genotyped on the Illumina 550 platform. The replication study was conducted on 122 patients and 328 controls. Although our study did not show any association P value that achieved genome-wide significance, and none of the top 100 SNPs reached the Bonferroni-corrected P value in the replication study, the plausible involvement of some variants cannot be entirely discarded. Three polymorphisms, rs8099939 [P = 2.12 × 10(-6), odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.43-2.67] in GRIK5, rs6122972 (P = 3.11 × 10(-6), OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.46-2.80) in PARD6B and rs2289700 (P = 9.14 × 10(-6), OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.53-2.95) in CTSH remained associated at a similar level after Mantel-Haenszel test for combining the results from the genome-wide and replication studies. A modest association was also detected for SNP rs1012053 (GWAS P = 4.50 × 10(-2)) in DGKH, which has already been reported as the most significant variant in a previous genome-wide scan on bipolar disorder. However, further studies using larger datasets are needed to identify variants with smaller effects that contribute to the risk of bipolar disorder.	
21782286	A genome-wide association study of aging.	Human longevity and healthy aging show moderate heritability (20%-50%). We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from 9 studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium for 2 outcomes: (1) all-cause mortality, and (2) survival free of major disease or death. No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was a genome-wide significant predictor of either outcome (p < 5 × 10(-8)). We found 14 independent SNPs that predicted risk of death, and 8 SNPs that predicted event-free survival (p < 10(-5)). These SNPs are in or near genes that are highly expressed in the brain (HECW2, HIP1, BIN2, GRIA1), genes involved in neural development and function (KCNQ4, LMO4, GRIA1, NETO1) and autophagy (ATG4C), and genes that are associated with risk of various diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In addition to considerable overlap between the traits, pathway and network analysis corroborated these findings. These findings indicate that variation in genes involved in neurological processes may be an important factor in regulating aging free of major disease and achieving longevity.	 19430479 19430483 21418511 3028245 19489743 19715440 19656157 19793722 20031568 15456762 15660509 15654334 15946728 16465619 16449388 16708071 16723543 16862161 16912992 16917933 16950665 17130144 17278972 17357083 17322881 17440072 17589519 17690295 17702883 17903295 18208581 18765803 18756013 18852200 18806760 18986374 19196970 19323994 19415983 19436320 19681160 20010950 20336132 20336135 20336136 20304771 10903333 11015124 11257102 11404818 11684017 11701657 11797009 11836532 12165561 12351577 12441050 12634289 12659814 12806208 12855072 12833050 12952881 14643381 14668850 14720177 14728640 15297675 3281256 8227991 8786073 9460063 19900591
21775986	The landscape of recombination in African Americans.	Recombination, together with mutation, gives rise to genetic variation in populations. Here we leverage the recent mixture of people of African and European ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map measuring the probability of crossing over at each position in the genome, based on about 2.1 million crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African Americans. At intervals of more than three megabases it is nearly identical to a map built in Europeans. At finer scales it differs significantly, and we identify about 2,500 recombination hotspots that are active in people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive in Europeans. The probability of a crossover at these hotspots is almost fully controlled by the alleles an individual carries at PRDM9 (P value < 10(-245)). We identify a 17-base-pair DNA sequence motif that is enriched in these hotspots, and is an excellent match to the predicted binding target of PRDM9 alleles common in West Africans and rare in Europeans. Sites of this motif are predicted to be risk loci for disease-causing genomic rearrangements in individuals carrying these alleles. More generally, this map provides a resource for research in human genetic variation and evolution.	 11346797 21058334 11586303 12053178 15088269 15088270 15105499 4208017 15627237 16224025 16945910 17115058 17943122 17989245 18252211 18239089 18239090 19165926 19543370 20044538 20044539 20044541 20818382 20981092 20981099
21814517	Genome-wide association study identifies HLA-DP as a susceptibility gene for pediatric asthma in Asian populations.	Asthma is a complex phenotype influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 938 Japanese pediatric asthma patients and 2,376 controls. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing strong associations (P<1×10(-8)) in GWAS were further genotyped in an independent Japanese samples (818 cases and 1,032 controls) and in Korean samples (835 cases and 421 controls). SNP rs987870, located between HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1, was consistently associated with pediatric asthma in 3 independent populations (P(combined) = 2.3×10(-10), odds ratio [OR] = 1.40). HLA-DP allele analysis showed that DPA1*0201 and DPB1*0901, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, were strongly associated with pediatric asthma (DPA1*0201: P = 5.5×10(-10), OR = 1.52, and DPB1*0901: P = 2.0×10(-7), OR = 1.49). Our findings show that genetic variants in the HLA-DP locus are associated with the risk of pediatric asthma in Asian populations.	 1662118 15007363 9119528 9168851 10323339 16210052 21121932 2256580 16862161 17078465 17293876 17234427 17332911 17099141 17611496 17804836 18341619 18817904 19037964 19028721 19426955 19714205 19715440 19439981 19761839 19950302 19700935 20032318 20159242 20159264 20232579 20424227 20634204 20860503 20877124 10641564 11315092 12499305 14576061 1774196

21799462	Genome-wide association study of epirubicin-induced leukopenia in Japanese patients.	Despite long-term clinical experience with epirubicin, unpredictable severe adverse reactions remain an important determinant to limit the drug use.

21829377	Genetic loci associated with plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from the CHARGE Consortium.	Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can derive from diet or from α-linolenic acid (ALA) by elongation and desaturation. We investigated the association of common genetic variation with plasma phospholipid levels of the four major n-3 PUFAs by performing genome-wide association studies in five population-based cohorts comprising 8,866 subjects of European ancestry. Minor alleles of SNPs in FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) were associated with higher levels of ALA (p = 3 x 10⁻⁶⁴) and lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, p = 5 x 10⁻⁵⁸) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, p = 4 x 10⁻¹⁵⁴). Minor alleles of SNPs in ELOVL2 (elongase) were associated with higher EPA (p = 2 x 10⁻¹²) and DPA (p = 1 x 10⁻⁴³) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, p = 1 x 10⁻¹⁵). In addition to genes in the n-3 pathway, we identified a novel association of DPA with several SNPs in GCKR (glucokinase regulator, p = 1 x 10⁻⁸). We observed a weaker association between ALA and EPA among carriers of the minor allele of a representative SNP in FADS2 (rs1535), suggesting a lower rate of ALA-to-EPA conversion in these subjects. In samples of African, Chinese, and Hispanic ancestry, associations of n-3 PUFAs were similar with a representative SNP in FADS1 but less consistent with a representative SNP in ELOVL2. Our findings show that common variation in n-3 metabolic pathway genes and in GCKR influences plasma phospholipid levels of n-3 PUFAs in populations of European ancestry and, for FADS1, in other ancestries.	 17676998 17616765 18320251 18442630 18469234 18435934 18614744 18779288 18936223 19022967 19061714 18479586 19060906 19060911 19148276 19200528 20031568 20081858 19919682 20335541 20463042 20427696 21058334 20691134 11094031 12562861 12816769 12907139 12908891 15146965 7563561 9571330 10189072 10351918 13539023 15834128 16157949 16670158 16825680 16832161 16818809 16895896 16908951 17101822 17374659 17413110 17572673 18193043

21804549	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of asthma in ethnically diverse North American populations.	Asthma is a common disease with a complex risk architecture including both genetic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis of North American genome-wide association studies of asthma in 5,416 individuals with asthma (cases) including individuals of European American, African American or African Caribbean, and Latino ancestry, with replication in an additional 12,649 individuals from the same ethnic groups. We identified five susceptibility loci. Four were at previously reported loci on 17q21, near IL1RL1, TSLP and IL33, but we report for the first time, to our knowledge, that these loci are associated with asthma risk in three ethnic groups. In addition, we identified a new asthma susceptibility locus at PYHIN1, with the association being specific to individuals of African descent (P = 3.9 × 10(-9)). These results suggest that some asthma susceptibility loci are robust to differences in ancestry when sufficiently large samples sizes are investigated, and that ancestry-specific associations also contribute to the complex genetic architecture of asthma.	 15080825 20860503 2060393 16395390 17611496 17947969 17992541 18301422 18395550 18310477 18401594 18923164 18760456 19029000 19133921 19175592 19426955 19543373 19714205 20032318 19910028 20159242 20187776 20372189 2252253
21804548	Genome-wide association study identifies three new susceptibility loci for adult asthma in the Japanese population.	Bronchial asthma is a common inflammatory disease caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Through a genome-wide association study and a replication study consisting of a total of 7,171 individuals with adult asthma (cases) and 27,912 controls in the Japanese population, we identified five loci associated with susceptibility to adult asthma. In addition to the major histocompatibility complex and TSLP-WDR36 loci previously reported, we identified three additional loci: a USP38-GAB1 locus on chromosome 4q31 (combined P = 1.87 × 10(-12)), a locus on chromosome 10p14 (P = 1.79 × 10(-15)) and a gene-rich region on chromosome 12q13 (P = 2.33 × 10(-13)). We observed the most significant association with adult asthma at rs404860 in the major histocompatiblity complex region (P = 4.07 × 10(-23)), which is close to rs2070600, a SNP previously reported for association with FEV(1)/FVC in genome-wide association studies for lung function. Our findings offer a better understanding of the genetic contribution to asthma susceptibility.	 12499305 20860503 16386802 16862161 17507702 17611496 17701901 17982410 18252225 18274560 18301422 18198356 19151747 19426955 19539984 19696312 19745201 20010834 20010835 20037613 20032318 19910028 20159242 20300138 20371526 20596022 11378822 12444029 20676098 20627891 20816550 14597484

To identify susceptibility loci for meningioma, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 859 affected individuals (cases) and 704 controls with validation in two independent sample sets totaling 774 cases and 1,764 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus for meningioma at 10p12.31 (MLLT10, rs11012732, odds ratio = 1.46, P(combined) = 1.88 × 10(-14)).

21812969	Genome-wide association study identifies candidate genes for Parkinson's disease in an Ashkenazi Jewish population.	To date, nine Parkinson disease (PD) genome-wide association studies in North American, European and Asian populations have been published. The majority of studies have confirmed the association of the previously identified genetic risk factors, SNCA and MAPT, and two studies have identified three new PD susceptibility loci/genes (PARK16, BST1 and HLA-DRB5). In a recent meta-analysis of datasets from five of the published PD GWAS an additional 6 novel candidate genes (SYT11, ACMSD, STK39, MCCC1/LAMP3, GAK and CCDC62/HIP1R) were identified. Collectively the associations identified in these GWAS account for only a small proportion of the estimated total heritability of PD suggesting that an 'unknown' component of the genetic architecture of PD remains to be identified.	 11709080 21292315 12446870 14520664 14598172 15087508 9197268 9560156 9861668 15541308 15654335 16252231 16436782 17052657 16949250 17050822 17701901 17875915 18256235 18974171 18985386 19524782 19615533 19283415 19772629 19846850 19915575 19915576 19837631 20070850 20560205 20506312 20623535 20711177 20683486 21044948 21084426 11715044
21829393	Genome-wide association analysis of autoantibody positivity in type 1 diabetes cases.	The genetic basis of autoantibody production is largely unknown outside of associations located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. The aim of this study is the discovery of new genetic associations with autoantibody positivity using genome-wide association scan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients with autoantibody measurements. We measured two anti-islet autoantibodies, glutamate decarboxylase (GADA, n = 2,506), insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA-2A, n = 2,498), antibodies to the autoimmune thyroid (Graves') disease (AITD) autoantigen thyroid peroxidase (TPOA, n = 8,300), and antibodies against gastric parietal cells (PCA, n = 4,328) that are associated with autoimmune gastritis. Two loci passed a stringent genome-wide significance level (p<10(-10)): 1q23/FCRL3 with IA-2A and 9q34/ABO with PCA. Eleven of 52 non-MHC T1D loci showed evidence of association with at least one autoantibody at a false discovery rate of 16%: 16p11/IL27-IA-2A, 2q24/IFIH1-IA-2A and PCA, 2q32/STAT4-TPOA, 10p15/IL2RA-GADA, 6q15/BACH2-TPOA, 21q22/UBASH3A-TPOA, 1p13/PTPN22-TPOA, 2q33/CTLA4-TPOA, 4q27/IL2/TPOA, 15q14/RASGRP1/TPOA, and 12q24/SH2B3-GADA and TPOA. Analysis of the TPOA-associated loci in 2,477 cases with Graves' disease identified two new AITD loci (BACH2 and UBASH3A).	 8855736 8647206 9833935 13471902 15838509 16580840 17334650 17952073 18209091 18179282 18073310 18331414 18604267 18504544 19092835 19155502 19039033 19429597 19648918 19729612 19838195 19940299 20190142 20190752 20140847 20441431 20508230 20445565 20570966 20551013 19430480 20937632 21102463 10739334 10753728 11206405 11586956 11836274 11978629 12116176 15001171 15448087 5826425 4158890 5090871 2168432 8335172 9314633
21824976	A genome-wide association study of bladder cancer identifies a new susceptibility locus within SLC14A1, a urea transporter gene on chromosome 18q12.3.	Genome-wide and candidate-gene association studies of bladder cancer have identified 10 susceptibility loci thus far. We conducted a meta-analysis of two previously published genome-wide scans (4501 cases and 6076 controls of European background) and followed up the most significant association signals [17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genomic regions] in 1382 cases and 2201 controls from four studies. A combined analysis adjusted for study center, age, sex, and smoking status identified a novel susceptibility locus that mapped to a region of 18q12.3, marked by rs7238033 (P = 8.7 × 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.20 with 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and two highly correlated SNPs, rs10775480/rs10853535 (r(2)= 1.00; P = 8.9 × 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.16 with 95% CI: 1.10-1.22). The signal localizes to the solute carrier family 14 member 1 gene, SLC14A1, a urea transporter that regulates cellular osmotic pressure. In the kidney, SLC14A1 regulates urine volume and concentration whereas in erythrocytes it determines the Kidd blood groups. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in SLC14A1 could provide new etiological insights into bladder carcinogenesis.	 10835412 21309779 12856182 15052270 15342541 510245 7064211 1902060 1498276 8320745 8172997 16112301 17060358 17510073 17684133 17701901 18441336 18852200 18794855 19151717 19648920 19692168 20348956 20562874 20610279 20972438 11792714
21827660	Combinations of newly confirmed Glioma-Associated loci link regions on chromosomes 1 and 9 to increased disease risk.	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tends to occur between the ages of 45 and 70. This relatively early onset and its poor prognosis make the impact of GBM on public health far greater than would be suggested by its relatively low frequency. Tissue and blood samples have now been collected for a number of populations, and predisposing alleles have been sought by several different genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) at NIH has also collected a considerable amount of data. Because of the low concordance between the results obtained using different populations, only 14 predisposing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) candidates in five genomic regions have been replicated in two or more studies. The purpose of this paper is to present an improved approach to biomarker identification.	 16199517 16862161 17502601 19357641 17449433 19578367 17942900 19723662 10647931 19578366 9012460 19578363 12539951 17609372 16415888 9928473 15118671 18772890 19341507 20187943 18599447 20093296 9205070 17701901 15665853 19728866 8939849 18607852 18328944 10414349 14678958
21826085	DPP6 as a candidate gene for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.	We implemented a two-step approach to detect potential predictor gene variants for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) in schizophrenic subjects. First, we screened associations by using a genome-wide (Illumina HumanHapCNV370) SNP array in 61 Japanese schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant TD and 61 Japanese schizophrenia patients without TD. Next, we performed a replication analysis in 36 treatment-resistant TD and 138 non-TD subjects. An association of an SNP in the DPP6 (dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein-6) gene, rs6977820, the most promising association identified by the screen, was significant in the replication sample (allelic P=0.008 in the replication sample, allelic P=4.6 × 10(-6), odds ratio 2.32 in the combined sample). The SNP is located in intron-1 of the DPP6 gene and the risk allele was associated with decreased DPP6 gene expression in the human postmortem prefrontal cortex. Chronic administration of haloperidol increased Dpp6 expression in mouse brains. DPP6 is an auxiliary subunit of Kv4 and regulates the properties of Kv4, which regulates the activity of dopaminergic neurons. The findings of this study indicate that an altered response of Kv4/DPP6 to long-term neuroleptic administration is involved in neuroleptic-induced TD.	
21833088	Genetic risk and a primary role for cell-mediated immune mechanisms in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous system in which the interplay between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typically results in intermittent neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of disability. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.	 21044948 10802651 10939572 11315092 15930013 16080120 16421134 16905561 17653284 17660530 17952073 18179884 18970977 18843511 19010793 19364933 19525953 19525955 19444308 20208533 20362272 20453840 20584945 20953190 21049023
21835309	GWAS findings for human iris patterns: associations with variants in genes that influence normal neuronal pattern development.	Human iris patterns are highly variable. The origins of this variation are of interest in the study of iris-related eye diseases and forensics, as well as from an embryological developmental perspective, with regard to their possible relationship to fundamental processes of neurodevelopment. We have performed genome-wide association scans on four iris characteristics (crypt frequency, furrow contractions, presence of peripupillary pigmented ring, and number of nevi) in three Australian samples of European descent. Both the discovery (n = 2121) and replication (n = 499 and 73) samples showed evidence for association between (1) crypt frequency and variants in the axonal guidance gene SEMA3A (p = 6.6 × 10(-11)), (2) furrow contractions and variants within the cytoskeleton gene TRAF3IP1 (p = 2.3 × 10(-12)), and (3) the pigmented ring and variants in the well-known pigmentation gene SLC24A4 (p = 7.6 × 10(-21)). These replicated findings individually accounted for around 1.5%-3% of the variance for these iris characteristics. Because both SEMA3A and TRAFIP1 are implicated in pathways that control neurogenesis, neural migration, and synaptogenesis, we also examined the evidence of enhancement among such genes, finding enrichment for crypts and furrows. These findings suggest that genes involved in normal neuronal pattern development may also influence tissue structures in the human iris.	 19188590 18398432 19265028 19619260 19803772 19896111 19833121 20041218 19710684 20207112 20463881 20585627 20598278 20616382 20457092 20688739 10766232 10797266 11606374 12052906 12386935 12454988 12610647 12855068 15004500 15057935 15066147 15272419 15485501 9097764 9233772 9556027 9753685 10192392 10396383 15386596 15939883 16368560 16862161 17148041 17351482 17449454 17924335 17952075 17466284 18387531 18426404 18348202 18483556 17684500 18467663 19278628
21841780	A genome-wide association study identifies two new risk loci for Graves' disease.	Graves' disease is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by thyroid stimulating hormone receptor autoantibodies (TRAb) and hyperthyroidism. To investigate the genetic architecture of Graves' disease, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,536 individuals with Graves' disease (cases) and 1,516 controls. We further evaluated a group of associated SNPs in a second set of 3,994 cases and 3,510 controls. We confirmed four previously reported loci (in the major histocompatibility complex, TSHR, CTLA4 and FCRL3) and identified two new susceptibility loci (the RNASET2-FGFR1OP-CCR6 region at 6q27 (P(combined) = 6.85 × 10(-10) for rs9355610) and an intergenic region at 4p14 (P(combined) = 1.08 × 10(-13) for rs6832151)). These newly associated SNPs were correlated with the expression levels of RNASET2 at 6q27, of CHRNA9 and of a previously uncharacterized gene at 4p14, respectively. Moreover, we identified strong associations of TSHR and major histocompatibility complex class II variants with persistently TRAb-positive Graves' disease.	 8288723 20526340 17873877 15838509 19635859 16862161 17943122 20453841 12724780 20526339 19715440 17675761 15741259 17597093 15531553 19349983 20502693 18587394 7216345 20233392 19635864 20352109 19382914 17462505 17701901 19126779 16571093 20453842 17952073 19244275 15558498 15809705
21844665	Common variants at the promoter region of the APOM confer a risk of rheumatoid arthritis.	Although the genetic component in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been consistently suggested, many novel genetic loci remain to uncover. To identify RA risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 100 RA cases and 600 controls using Affymetrix SNP array 5.0. The candidate risk locus (APOM gene) was re-sequenced to discover novel promoter and coding variants in a group of the subjects. Replication was performed with the independent case-control set comprising of 578 RAs and 711 controls. Through GWAS, we identified a novel SNP associated with RA at the APOM gene in the MHC class III region on 6p21.33 (rs805297, odds ratio (OR) = 2.28, P = 5.20 × 10-7). Three more polymorphisms were identified at the promoter region of the APOM by the re-sequencing. For the replication, we genotyped the four SNP loci in the independent case-control set. The association of rs805297 identified by GWAS was successfully replicated (OR = 1.40, P = 6.65 × 10-5). The association became more significant in the combined analysis of discovery and replication sets (OR = 1.56, P = 2.73 × 10-10). The individuals with the rs805297 risk allele (A) at the promoter region showed a significantly lower level of APOM expression compared with those with the protective allele (C) homozygote. In the logistic regressions by the phenotype status, the homozygote risk genotype (A/A) consistently showed higher ORs than the heterozygote one (A/C) for the phenotype-positive RAs. These results indicate that APOM promoter polymorphisms are significantly associated with the susceptibility to RA.	 19835638 20453842 10531326 10643697 12181776 12528108 12748655 12849067 14749714 15102878 3358796 10451065 15793583 16235980 17293876 17554300 17674965 17804836 17982456 18054359 18668548 18794853 18835879 18803288 19007767 19180477 19286905 19503088 19714643 20453841
21844884	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies variants associated with platinating agent susceptibility across populations.	Platinating agents are used in the treatment of many cancers, yet they can induce toxicities and resistance that limit their utility. Using previously published and additional world population panels of diverse ancestry totaling 608 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we performed meta-analyses of over 3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for both carboplatin- and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. The most significant SNP in the carboplatin meta-analysis is located in an intron of NBAS (neuroblastoma amplified sequence; P=5.1 × 10(-7)). The most significant SNP in the cisplatin meta-analysis is upstream of KRT16P2 (P=5.8 × 10(-7)). We also show that cisplatin-susceptibility SNPs are enriched for carboplatin-susceptibility SNPs. Most of the variants that associate with platinum-induced cytotoxicity are polymorphic across multiple world populations; therefore, they could be tested in follow-up studies in diverse clinical populations. Seven genes previously implicated in platinating agent response, including BCL2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2), GSTM1 (glutathione S-transferase mu 1), GSTT1, ERCC2 and ERCC6, were also implicated in our meta-analyses.	 14692504 10810335 10909856 11081456 11315092 12820379 14576837 15282376 6367971 3281842 3283185 8443798 8040325 7478541 8622011 9209670 9391552 9440758 9470840 15604262 15789122 16255080 17028906 17237264 17084534 17228018 17701890 17701901 17943122 17457342 18162130 18439551 18765826 18852200 18978564 19139108 19200528 19109566 19525887 19543370 19898621 19898482 19933162 19701749 20393316 20616382 20811451 20634204 21058334 21049517 21497773 21483023
21862451	GWAS of butyrylcholinesterase activity identifies four novel loci, independent effects within BCHE and secondary associations with metabolic risk factors.	Serum butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) activity is associated with obesity, blood pressure and biomarkers of cardiovascular and diabetes risk. We have conducted a genome-wide association scan to discover genetic variants affecting BCHE activity, and to clarify whether the associations between BCHE activity and cardiometabolic risk factors are caused by variation in BCHE or whether BCHE variation is secondary to the metabolic abnormalities. We measured serum BCHE in adolescents and adults from three cohorts of Australian twin and family studies. The genotypes from ∼2.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available in 8791 participants with BCHE measurements. We detected significant associations with BCHE activity at three independent groups of SNPs at the BCHE locus (P = 5.8 × 10(-262), 7.8 × 10(-47), 2.9 × 10(-12)) and at four other loci: RNPEP (P = 9.4 × 10(-16)), RAPH1-ABI2 (P = 4.1 × 10(-18)), UGT1A1 (P = 4.0 × 10(-8)) and an intergenic region on chromosome 8 (P = 1.4 × 10(-8)). These loci affecting BCHE activity were not associated with metabolic risk factors. On the other hand, SNPs in genes previously associated with metabolic risk had effects on BCHE activity more often than can be explained by chance. In particular, SNPs within FTO and GCKR were associated with BCHE activity, but their effects were partly mediated by body mass index and triglycerides, respectively. We conclude that variation in BCHE activity is due to multiple variants across the spectrum from uncommon/large effect to common/small effect, and partly results from (rather than causes) metabolic abnormalities.	 18439548 18346983 18454146 18490833 18452903 18678614 19088850 19060907 19060909 19060911 19079260 19079261 19503597 19424713 19383604 19655390 19502414 19820699 19860904 19896111 19948621 20173736 20616382 21529783 10744755 11410111 11463151 11793025 12074828 14744958 15258737 15497462 7318992 1864486 1778609 1570838 8149699 7931819 7793180 10467730 14939769 13726518 15843232 16080113 15907830 16527886 16574762 17539372 17903303 17903117 17917325 17924335 17885689 18252222 18076380 17852836 18375477
21871595	A variant in MCF2L is associated with osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent, heritable degenerative joint disease with a substantial public health impact. We used a 1000-Genomes-Project-based imputation in a genome-wide association scan for osteoarthritis (3177 OA cases and 4894 controls) to detect a previously unidentified risk locus. We discovered a small disease-associated set of variants on chromosome 13. Through large-scale replication, we establish a robust association with SNPs in MCF2L (rs11842874, combined odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.17 [1.11-1.23], p = 2.1 × 10(-8)) across a total of 19,041 OA cases and 24,504 controls of European descent. This risk locus represents the third established signal for OA overall. MCF2L regulates a nerve growth factor (NGF), and treatment with a humanized monoclonal antibody against NGF is associated with reduction in pain and improvement in function for knee OA patients.	 8581752 15133739 17109745 17530714 17572673 17955331 18163515 18455228 19424496 19366686 19479880 19728115 19812666 20136363 20112360 20418889 20479774 20509871 20942668 20942675 20981092 21058334 21079645 21068099 20870806 21177295 21385855 14043587
21901158	Genome-wide detection of allele specific copy number variation associated with insulin resistance in African Americans from the HyperGEN study.	African Americans have been understudied in genome wide association studies of diabetes and related traits. In the current study, we examined the joint association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) with fasting insulin and an index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the HyperGEN study, a family based study with proband ascertainment for hypertension. This analysis is restricted to 1,040 African Americans without diabetes. We generated allele specific CNV genotypes at 872,243 autosomal loci using Birdsuite, a freely available multi-stage program. Joint tests of association for SNPs and CNVs were performed using linear mixed models adjusting for covariates and familial relationships. Our results highlight SNPs associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (rs6576507 and rs8026527, 3.7*10(-7)≤P≤1.1*10(-5)) near ATPase, class V, type 10A (ATP10A), and the L Type voltage dependent calcium channel (CACNA1D, rs1401492, P≤5.2*10(-6)). ATP10A belongs to a family of aminophospholipid-transporting ATPases and has been associated with type 2 diabetes in mice. CACNA1D has been linked to pancreatic beta cell generation in mice. The two most significant copy variable markers (rs10277702 and rs361367; P<2.0*10(-4)) were in the beta variable region of the T-cell receptor gene (TCRVB). Human and mouse TCR has been shown to mimic insulin and its receptor and could contribute to insulin resistance. Our findings differ from genome wide association studies of fasting insulin and other diabetes related traits in European populations, highlighting the continued need to investigate unique genetic influences for understudied populations such as African Americans.	 21068340 21219177 11581302 11729172 12817591 15051828 15286789 3177389 8317453 7541430 7668272 9118953 15601533 15747111 15867434 16862161 16933183 17493546 17563458 17660554 17726382 18075967 18252897 18443202 18762020 18776909 18852202 18923514 19095600 19179214 19051206 19378150 19609347 19602701 19902174 19956073 20081858 20144314 20217509 20208535 20360734 20156068 19960030 20453204 20865176 20610895 21249187 20980453 10964005
21866343	The 18p11.22 locus is associated with never smoker non-small cell lung cancer susceptibility in Korean populations.	The proportion of never smoker non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Asia is about 30-40%. Despite the striking demographics and high prevalence of never smoker NSCLC, the exact causes still remain undetermined. Although several genome wide association (GWA) studies were conducted to find susceptibility loci for lung cancer in never smokers, no regions were replicated except for 5p15.33, suggesting locus heterogeneity and different environmental toxic effects. To identify genetic loci associated with susceptibility of lung cancer in never smokers, we performed a GWA analysis using the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. For discovery GWA set, we recruited 446 never smoking Korean patients with NSCLC and 497 normal subjects. We tested association of SNPs with lung cancer susceptibility using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. For validation, 39 SNPs were selected from the top 50 SNPs and five additional SNPs were selected in the DAB1 gene region which showed significant associations in the GWA analysis. The validation SNPs were genotyped in an independent sample including 434 patients and 1,000 controls. Among the 44 validation SNPs, two SNPs (rs11080466 and rs11663246) near the APCDD1, NAPG and FAM38B genes in the 18p11.22 region were replicated. P value of rs11080466 was 1.08 × 10(-6) in the combined sets (2.68 × 10(-5) in the discovery set and 2.60 × 10(-3) in the validation set) and odds ratio was 0.68 (0.58-0.79). We observed similar association for rs11663246. Our result suggests the 18p11.22 region as a novel lung cancer susceptibility locus in never smokers.	 20813920 9698121 14735478 18385676 18978787 15761078 18957677 18978790 15613366 18385738 15297300 20304703 20700438 17428724 19151717 15741570 17701901 19797421 19396169 17290066 19543373 17625570 2258272 12048270

21874001	Genome-wide association study in individuals of South Asian ancestry identifies six new type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci.	We carried out a genome-wide association study of type-2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals of South Asian ancestry. Our discovery set included 5,561 individuals with T2D (cases) and 14,458 controls drawn from studies in London, Pakistan and Singapore. We identified 20 independent SNPs associated with T2D at P < 10(-4) for testing in a replication sample of 13,170 cases and 25,398 controls, also all of South Asian ancestry. In the combined analysis, we identified common genetic variants at six loci (GRB14, ST6GAL1, VPS26A, HMG20A, AP3S2 and HNF4A) newly associated with T2D (P = 4.1 × 10(-8) to P = 1.9 × 10(-11)). SNPs at GRB14 were also associated with insulin sensitivity (P = 5.0 × 10(-4)), and SNPs at ST6GAL1 and HNF4A were also associated with pancreatic beta-cell function (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively). Our findings provide additional insight into mechanisms underlying T2D and show the potential for new discovery from genetic association studies in South Asians, a population with increased susceptibility to T2D.	 17572673 17293876 17982457 18193046 18502301 18454146 18462017 18656452 18650447 19183311 19210179 19361613 19404752 19420381 19531583 19648926 19541746 19644074 19779445 19884620 19700652 19924231 19995197 19937311 20062061 19896746 19875164 20080505 20308177 20581827 20530487 20935629 20981092 21035762 20580033 21142536 21219602 21304890 21378988 21294771 19838192 10801388 12068289 15189364 15355432 8945471 9118953 9105038 16037382 16714383 16862161 16900881 10683001 10773667 10948207 17167471 17873877
21876539	Genome-wide association analysis of coffee drinking suggests association with CYP1A1/CYP1A2 and NRCAM.	Coffee consumption is a model for addictive behavior. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on coffee intake from 8 Caucasian cohorts (N=18 176) and sought replication of our top findings in a further 7929 individuals. We also performed a gene expression analysis treating different cell lines with caffeine. Genome-wide significant association was observed for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15q24 region. The two SNPs rs2470893 and rs2472297 (P-values=1.6 × 10(-11) and 2.7 × 10(-11)), which were also in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2)=0.7) with each other, lie in the 23-kb long commonly shared 5' flanking region between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes. CYP1A1 was found to be downregulated in lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with caffeine. CYP1A1 is known to metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are important constituents of coffee, whereas CYP1A2 is involved in the primary metabolism of caffeine. Significant evidence of association was also detected at rs382140 (P-value=3.9 × 10(-09)) near NRCAM-a gene implicated in vulnerability to addiction, and at another independent hit rs6495122 (P-value=7.1 × 10(-09))-an SNP associated with blood pressure-in the 15q24 region near the gene ULK3, in the meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts. Our results from GWASs and expression analysis also strongly implicate CAB39L in coffee drinking.

21878436	A genome-wide association study identifies a region at chromosome 12 as a potential susceptibility locus for restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention.	Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become an effective therapy to treat obstructive coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, one of the major drawbacks of PCI is the occurrence of restenosis in 5-25% of all initially treated patients. Restenosis is defined as the re-narrowing of the lumen of the blood vessel, resulting in renewed symptoms and the need for repeated intervention. To identify genetic variants that are associated with restenosis, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 295 patients who developed restenosis (cases) and 571 who did not (controls) from the GENetic Determinants of Restenosis (GENDER) study. Analysis of ~550 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GENDER was followed by a replication phase in three independent case-control populations (533 cases and 3067 controls). A potential susceptibility locus for restenosis at chromosome 12, including rs10861032 (P(combined) = 1.11 × 10(-7)) and rs9804922 (P(combined) = 1.45 × 10(-6)), was identified in the GWAS and replication phase. In addition, both SNPs were also associated with coronary events (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.005; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.023) in a trial based cohort set of elderly patients with (enhanced risk of) CAD (PROSPER) and all-cause mortality in PROSPER (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.007; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.013) and GENDER (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.005; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.023). Further analysis suggests that this locus could be involved in regulatory functions.	 10569329 15550541 11439344 11686664 12050336 12422143 12457784 12468460 12706922 15297300 16230497 16319143 16531618 16216853 17384015 17701901 17934484 18292342 18398418 18519035 18573870 18949370 19369657 19359419 19715440 19834560 19926059 19948885 20173736 20190752 20233392 20686565 20634204 20823317 21058334 12958120 14597926 14599634 15070753 15231375 15258987 15469413 2950322 2248430 1856404 8041413 7850985 9236417 9641690 9887164 10051292 10190398 10217658 10366655 15547748 10889131
21878437	Genome-wide association study of circulating retinol levels.	Retinol is one of the most biologically active forms of vitamin A and is hypothesized to influence a wide range of human diseases including asthma, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases and cancer. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 5006 Caucasian individuals drawn from two cohorts of men: the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. We identified two independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with circulating retinol levels, which are located near the transthyretin (TTR) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) genes which encode major carrier proteins of retinol: rs1667255 (P =2.30× 10(-17)) and rs10882272 (P =6.04× 10(-12)). We replicated the association with rs10882272 in RBP4 in independent samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Invecchiare in Chianti Study (InCHIANTI) that included 3792 women and 504 men (P =9.49× 10(-5)), but found no association for retinol with rs1667255 in TTR among women, thus suggesting evidence for gender dimorphism (P-interaction=1.31× 10(-5)). Discovery of common genetic variants associated with serum retinol levels may provide further insight into the contribution of retinol and other vitamin A compounds to the development of cancer and other complex diseases.	 12081831 21729881 8384721 8131277 8205268 9234850 9537797 10232633 15820775 15883420 15883426 16309738 16054167 17529973 18264096 18249188 19185284 19648918 19836008 20418485 20418489 20935629 21389041 3084131
21886157	Human metabolic individuality in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many risk loci for complex diseases, but effect sizes are typically small and information on the underlying biological processes is often lacking. Associations with metabolic traits as functional intermediates can overcome these problems and potentially inform individualized therapy. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with non-targeted metabolomics. We identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood metabolite concentrations, of which 25 show effect sizes that are unusually high for GWAS and account for 10-60% differences in metabolite levels per allele copy. Our associations provide new functional insights for many disease-related associations that have been reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism and Crohn's disease. The study advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of metabolic individuality in humans and generates many new hypotheses for biomedical and pharmaceutical research.	 19557189 19820697 20037589 20081858 20104246 19624122 20376050 20383145 20383146 20038957 11731797 11780939 11908751 12883891 14715671 1341057 8621609 13870090 15536204 16032514 17537913 17701901 17846035 17609683 18349289 18327256 18384253 18455228 18372322 18668440 18650507 18940312 18842065 19043545 19060911 19212411 19343178 19458390 19278955 19487289 19503597 19474294 19483665 19543373 19414484 19419973 20686565 21085649 21378990 21533175

21900946	Identification of independent risk loci for Graves' disease within the MHC in the Japanese population.	To identify genetic variants that confer the risk of Graves' disease (GD) in the Japanese population, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1119 Japanese individuals with GD and 2718 unrelated controls, and a subsequent replication study using independent 432 GD cases and 1157 controls. We identified 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be significantly associated with GD in the GWAS phase. Twenty-two out of 34 SNPs remained positive in the replication study. All 22 SNPs were located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus on chromosome 6p21. No strong long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed among the 22 SNPs, indicating independent involvement of multiple loci within the MHC with the risk of GD. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis selected rs3893464, rs4313034, rs3132613, rs4248154, rs2273017, rs9394159 and rs4713693, as markers for independent risk loci for GD. The analysis of LD between these seven SNPs and tagging SNPs for GD-associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in the Japanese population (HLA-DPB1(*)0501 and HLA-A(*)0206) demonstrated that all of and five of seven SNPs were not in strong LD with HLA-DPB1(*)0501 and HLA-A(*)0206, respectively. Although causal variants remain to be identified, our results demonstrate the existence of multiple GD susceptibility loci within the MHC region.	
21900944	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic variants in GOT1 determining serum aspartate aminotransferase levels.	We carried out a genome-wide association study of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity in 866 Amish participants of the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study and identified significant association of AST activity with a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms located on chromosome 10q24.1 (peak association was rs17109512; P=2.80E-14), in the vicinity of GOT1, the gene encoding cytosolic AST (cAST). Sequencing of GOT1 revealed an in-frame deletion of three nucleic acids encoding asparagine at position 389 c.1165_1167delAAC (p.Asn389del) in the gene. Deletion carriers had significantly lower AST activity levels compared with homozygotes for the common allele (mean±s.d.: 10.0±2.8 versus 18.8±5.2 U l(-1); P=2.80E-14). Further genotyping of the deletion in other Amish samples (n=1932) identified an additional 20 carriers (minor allele frequency (MAF)=0.0052). The deletion was not detected in 647 outbred Caucasians. Asn at codon 389 is conserved among known mammalian cASTs. In vitro transient transfection of wild-type and mutant cAST indicated that mutant cAST protein was barely detectable in the cells. Furthermore, even after correction for cAST expression, mutant cAST had markedly diminished enzymatic activity. Remarkably, we did not find any association between the deletion and metabolic traits including serum fasting glucose or insulin, fasting and post-meal lipids, inflammatory markers, or sub-clinical markers of cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, we discovered a rare in-frame deletion in GOT1 gene, which inactivates cAST enzyme in the Old Order Amish. This finding will help us to understand structure and function of the enzyme and would be useful for predicting serum AST levels.	 12194918 4337382 213206 466765 2849754 21059979 18464913 18940312 19074352 19209234 18440328
21931568	Genome-wide association study identifies four loci associated with eruption of permanent teeth.	The sequence and timing of permanent tooth eruption is thought to be highly heritable and can have important implications for the risk of malocclusion, crowding, and periodontal disease. We conducted a genome-wide association study of number of permanent teeth erupted between age 6 and 14 years, analyzed as age-adjusted standard deviation score averaged over multiple time points, based on childhood records for 5,104 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Four loci showed association at P<5×10(-8) and were replicated in four independent study groups from the United States and Denmark with a total of 3,762 individuals; all combined P-values were below 10(-11). Two loci agreed with previous findings in primary tooth eruption and were also known to influence height and breast cancer, respectively. The two other loci pointed to genomic regions without any previous significant genome-wide association study results. The intronic SNP rs7924176 in ADK could be linked to gene expression in monocytes. The combined effect of the four genetic variants was most pronounced between age 10 and 12 years, where children with 6 to 8 delayed tooth eruption alleles had on average 3.5 (95% confidence interval: 2.9-4.1) fewer permanent teeth than children with 0 or 1 of these alleles.	 20872241 11300177 10593443 20502693 14682644 21263130 15072700 15470346 4528826 18522740 19825159 3864376 17529967 17361661 621091 18037648 16107566 18333882 16385451 20839289 17849003 20041193 20881960 19330030 17529974 21102462 20091798 20616382 17529973 15711422 17767157 3860029 12542430 20852631 12648261 10872987 11775787 15080365 21058334 12949310 18450858 20195514 19191329 20634204 20453838 9207765 18715551 17701901 16225225 4153462 14249344 17150149 20516689 20802479 11989205
21931564	A genome-wide metabolic QTL analysis in Europeans implicates two loci shaped by recent positive selection.	We have performed a metabolite quantitative trait locus (mQTL) study of the (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H NMR) metabolome in humans, building on recent targeted knowledge of genetic drivers of metabolic regulation. Urine and plasma samples were collected from two cohorts of individuals of European descent, with one cohort comprised of female twins donating samples longitudinally. Sample metabolite concentrations were quantified by (1)H NMR and tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Four metabolites' concentrations exhibited significant, replicable association with SNP variation (8.6×10(-11)<p<2.8×10(-23)). Three of these-trimethylamine, 3-amino-isobutyrate, and an N-acetylated compound-were measured in urine. The other-dimethylamine-was measured in plasma. Trimethylamine and dimethylamine mapped to a single genetic region (hence we report a total of three implicated genomic regions). Two of the three hit regions lie within haplotype blocks (at 2p13.1 and 10q24.2) that carry the genetic signature of strong, recent, positive selection in European populations. Genes NAT8 and PYROXD2, both with relatively uncharacterized functional roles, are good candidates for mediating the corresponding mQTL associations. The study's longitudinal twin design allowed detailed variance-components analysis of the sources of population variation in metabolite levels. The mQTLs explained 40%-64% of biological population variation in the corresponding metabolites' concentrations. These effect sizes are stronger than those reported in a recent, targeted mQTL study of metabolites in serum using the targeted-metabolomics Biocrates platform. By re-analysing our plasma samples using the Biocrates platform, we replicated the mQTL findings of the previous study and discovered a previously uncharacterized yet substantial familial component of variation in metabolite levels in addition to the heritability contribution from the corresponding mQTL effects.	 20383146 20383145 20392701 20513649 20811451 21085649 21304890 21475195 21572414 21878913 20485568 10598751 11593451 11912495 12139432 12202775 12582260 12678693 6842395 6411064 6696735 3677545 8171437 7762816 13058271 15385443 15607018 15732908 16284200 16362285 16681555 16778047 16808434 16895997 17254428 17435758 17554300 17572673 18007604 18344982 18402670 18425110 18427557 18462017 18775301 18846210 18852201 19043545 18953024 18996895 19223927 19247286 19279085 17579516 19474294 19561590 19636342 19644074 19741703 19858363 20037589 20220756 20220758
21908515	Genome-wide association study identifies breast cancer risk variant at 10q21.2: results from the Asia Breast Cancer Consortium.	Although approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for breast cancer risk through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), genetic risk variants reported to date explain only a small fraction of heritability for this common cancer. We conducted a four-stage GWAS including 17 153 cases and 16 943 controls among East-Asian women to search for new genetic risk factors for breast cancer. After analyzing 684 457 SNPs in 2062 cases and 2066 controls (Stage I), we selected for replication among 5969 Chinese women (4146 cases and 1823 controls) the top 49 SNPs that had neither been reported previously nor were in strong linkage disequilibrium with reported SNPs (Stage II). Three SNPs were further evaluated in up to 13 152 Chinese and Japanese women (6436 cases and 6716 controls) (Stage III). Finally, two SNPs were evaluated in 10 847 Korean women (4509 cases and 6338 controls) (Stage IV). SNP rs10822013 on chromosome 10q21.2, located in the zinc finger protein 365 (ZNF365) gene, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in all four stages with a combined per-risk allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07-1.14) (P-value for trend = 5.87 × 10(-9)). In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the potential functional significance of rs10822013. Our results strongly implicate rs10822013 at 10q21.2 as a genetic risk variant for breast cancer among East-Asian women.	 18974064 18413362 19219042 18326623 21263130 18782836 12740763 19330027 18438407 17529967 20484103 12610533 21060860 19031103 21497495 18931689 10861490 19330030 17529974 17529973 20585626 19275640 20699374 18845558 20852631 16617106 10552971 11329055 17932350 20453838 15824150 16259637 18288942 12718640 19396169 17337767 19183483 18629629 21514219 12958189 20390345 10695593

21896673	Genome-wide association study of HPV seropositivity.	High-risk α mucosal types of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers, whereas β cutaneous HPV types (e.g. HPV8) have been implicated in non-melanoma skin cancer. Although antibodies against the capsid protein L1 of HPV are considered as markers of cumulative exposure, not all infected persons seroconvert. To identify common genetic variants that influence HPV seroconversion, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study. Genome-wide genotyping of 316 015 single nucleotide polymorphisms was carried out using the Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChip in 4811 subjects from a central European case-control study of lung, head and neck and kidney cancer that had serology data available on 13 HPV types. Only one association met genome-wide significance criteria, namely that between HPV8 seropositivity and rs9357152 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24-1.50 for the minor allele G; P=1.2 × 10(-10)], a common genetic variant (minor allele frequency=0.33) located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II region at 6p21.32. This association was subsequently replicated in an independent set of 2344 subjects from a Latin American case-control study of head and neck cancer (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.18-1.56, P=2.2 × 10(-5)), yielding P=1.3 × 10(-14) in the combined analysis (P-heterogeneity=0.87). No heterogeneity was noted by cancer status (controls/lung cancer cases/head and neck cancer cases/kidney cancer cases). This study provides a proof of principle that genetic variation plays a role in antibody reactivity to HPV infection.	
21909110	Genome-wide association study identifies six new loci influencing pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure.	Numerous genetic loci have been associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Europeans. We now report genome-wide association studies of pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 × 10(-8) to P = 2.3 × 10(-13)) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits. These findings suggest new genetic pathways underlying blood pressure variation, some of which may differentially influence SBP and DBP.	 10358009 10938011 21572416 11082146 11263624 11315092 12020303 12493255 12963636 2522417 10091821 10477709 15528234 16265585 16467640 17572673 17676998 17998459 17606262 18289368 19118251 19221038 19820697 20044737 20139978 20139355 20526338 20664078 19430479 19430483 21909115
21909109	Large-scale genome-wide association studies in East Asians identify new genetic loci influencing metabolic traits.	To identify the genetic bases for nine metabolic traits, we conducted a meta-analysis combining Korean genome-wide association results from the KARE project (n = 8,842) and the HEXA shared control study (n = 3,703). We verified the associations of the loci selected from the discovery meta-analysis in the replication stage (30,395 individuals from the BioBank Japan genome-wide association study and individuals comprising the Health2 and Shanghai Jiao Tong University Diabetes cohorts). We identified ten genome-wide significant signals newly associated with traits from an overall meta-analysis. The most compelling associations involved 12q24.11 (near MYL2) and 12q24.13 (in C12orf51) for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2p21 (near SIX2-SIX3) for fasting plasma glucose, 19q13.33 (in RPS11) and 6q22.33 (in RSPO3) for renal traits, and 12q24.11 (near MYL2), 12q24.13 (in C12orf51 and near OAS1), 4q31.22 (in ZNF827) and 7q11.23 (near TBL2-BCL7B) for hepatic traits. These findings highlight previously unknown biological pathways for metabolic traits investigated in this study.	 17095717 18193044 18193043 17982410 18439548 20657596 19578367 9365406 19656773 17572673 21572416 20147318 17786212 10469848 19503597 17554260 20308177 19820697 20383146 18940312 19185284 19170031 19812666 19838193 19648918 18596051 19430482 20139978 17701901 18776909 19060906 19515215 19396169 19278955 20066004 20884846 20081857 20167578 12843687 11855950 16014697 20081858
21909106	Genome-wide association study identifies two susceptibility loci for exudative age-related macular degeneration in the Japanese population.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, is a complex disease caused by multiple environmental and genetic risk factors. To identify genetic factors that modify the risk of exudative AMD in the Japanese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study and a replication study using a total of 1,536 individuals with exudative AMD and 18,894 controls. In addition to CFH (rs800292, P = 4.23 × 10(-15)) and ARMS2 (rs3750847, P = 8.67 × 10(-29)) loci, we identified two new susceptibility loci for exudative AMD: TNFRSF10A-LOC389641 on chromosome 8p21 (rs13278062, combined P = 1.03 × 10(-12), odds ratio = 0.73) and REST-C4orf14-POLR2B-IGFBP7 on chromosome 4q12 (rs1713985, combined P = 2.34 × 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.30). Fine mapping revealed that rs13278062, which is known to alter TNFRSF10A transcriptional activity, had the most significant association in 8p21 region. Our results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of exudative AMD.	 20861866 11501945 21079736 9298415 18325906 17675159 17982410 20843825 20360305 20110127 20157352 15761122 17558321 19952990 12945014 12427055 15297300 19070628 18685559 12874246 19026761 16518403 9430227 11642370 17701901 19255449 19854291 18813321 19744734 20385826 20385819 18456285 10565519 12082627 17053108
21909107	Genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for thoracic aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections spanning FBN1 at 15q21.1.	Although thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) can be inherited as a single-gene disorder, the genetic predisposition in the majority of affected people is poorly understood. In a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS), we compared 765 individuals who had sporadic TAAD (STAAD) with 874 controls and identified common SNPs at a 15q21.1 locus that were associated with STAAD, with odds ratios of 1.6-1.8 that achieved genome-wide significance. We followed up 107 SNPs associated with STAAD with P < 1 × 10(-5) in the region, in two separate STAAD cohorts. The associated SNPs fall into a large region of linkage disequilibrium encompassing FBN1, which encodes fibrillin-1. FBN1 mutations cause Marfan syndrome, whose major cardiovascular complication is TAAD. This study shows that common genetic variants at 15q21.1 that probably act via FBN1 are associated with STAAD, suggesting a common pathogenesis of aortic disease in Marfan syndrome and STAAD.	 20082464 18544034 20452526 21055718 21092924 21493862 21698135 14647130 6702637 8941093 15781745 16129122 16444274 16601194 17994018 18178469 18431353 20233780
21909108	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from the CHARGE consortium identifies common variants associated with carotid intima media thickness and plaque.	Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and plaque determined by ultrasonography are established measures of subclinical atherosclerosis that each predicts future cardiovascular disease events. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in 31,211 participants of European ancestry from nine large studies in the setting of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. We then sought additional evidence to support our findings among 11,273 individuals using data from seven additional studies. In the combined meta-analysis, we identified three genomic regions associated with common carotid intima media thickness and two different regions associated with the presence of carotid plaque (P < 5 × 10(-8)). The associated SNPs mapped in or near genes related to cellular signaling, lipid metabolism and blood pressure homeostasis, and two of the regions were associated with coronary artery disease (P < 0.006) in the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis (CARDIoGRAM) consortium. Our findings may provide new insight into pathways leading to subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events.	 20526338 19936222 21378990 21311059 11701125 12118903 14730480 15256397 9887164 15692111 16631513 17242284 17878422 17525706 17901390 18261694 18172451 18356554 18834626 19110086 19060906 19060910 19060911 19161620 19198609 19221038 19503597 19553660 19361803 19890391 20031568 19802338 20160191 20177011 20378078 21098428
21909115	Genetic variants in novel pathways influence blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk.	Blood pressure is a heritable trait influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or  ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.	 12493255 2882506 7923361 7607734 8696333 10347222 10377427 15652604 15811924 16616959 17086182 17452643 18070814 18480116 19057520 19219041 19454737 19265717 20562874 20576804 20686565 20707915 19430479 19430483 20935630 21572416 11040222 11239411
21912425	A whole-genome association study of major determinants for allopurinol-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Japanese patients.	Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are severe, cutaneous adverse drug reactions that are rare but life threatening. Genetic biomarkers for allopurinol-related SJS/TEN in Japanese were examined in a genome-wide association study in which Japanese patients (n=14) were compared with ethnically matched healthy controls (n=991). Associations between 890 321 single nucleotide polymorphisms and allopurinol-related SJS/TEN were analyzed by the Fisher's exact test (dominant genotype mode). A total of 21 polymorphisms on chromosome 6 were significantly associated with allopurinol-related SJS/TEN. The strongest association was found at rs2734583 in BAT1, rs3094011 in HCP5 and GA005234 in MICC (P=2.44 × 10(-8); odds ratio=66.8; 95% confidence interval, 19.8-225.0). rs9263726 in PSORS1C1, also significantly associated with allopurinol-related SJS/TEN, is in absolute linkage disequilibrium with human leukocyte antigen-B*5801, which is in strong association with allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN. The ease of typing rs9263726 makes it a useful biomarker for allopurinol-related SJS/TEN in Japanese.	
21935397	Genome-wide population-based association study of extremely overweight young adults--the GOYA study.	Thirty-two common variants associated with body mass index (BMI) have been identified in genome-wide association studies, explaining ∼1.45% of BMI variation in general population cohorts. We performed a genome-wide association study in a sample of young adults enriched for extremely overweight individuals. We aimed to identify new loci associated with BMI and to ascertain whether using an extreme sampling design would identify the variants known to be associated with BMI in general populations.	 19079260 18698412 19151714 19557161 19553259 20041193 20054173 20421936 20935630 14641243 11349228 10979604 9526169 16175512 16715099 17273979 19079261
21926974	Genome-wide association study identifies five new schizophrenia loci.	We examined the role of common genetic variation in schizophrenia in a genome-wide association study of substantial size: a stage 1 discovery sample of 21,856 individuals of European ancestry and a stage 2 replication sample of 29,839 independent subjects. The combined stage 1 and 2 analysis yielded genome-wide significant associations with schizophrenia for seven loci, five of which are new (1p21.3, 2q32.3, 8p23.2, 8q21.3 and 10q24.32-q24.33) and two of which have been previously implicated (6p21.32-p22.1 and 18q21.2). The strongest new finding (P = 1.6 × 10(-11)) was with rs1625579 within an intron of a putative primary transcript for MIR137 (microRNA 137), a known regulator of neuronal development. Four other schizophrenia loci achieving genome-wide significance contain predicted targets of MIR137, suggesting MIR137-mediated dysregulation as a previously unknown etiologic mechanism in schizophrenia. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10(-9)), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10(-8)) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10(-9)).	 11050243 11315092 15502875 15652477 15806104 18208327 18316599 18300295 18577219 18587394 19150704 18711365 19416921 19571808 19571809 19571811 19816555 20368621 20362272 20506192 20562875 20811451 20600988 19621016 20881960 20935630 21142928 21376301 21407268 21483432
21926972	Large-scale genome-wide association analysis of bipolar disorder identifies a new susceptibility locus near ODZ4.	We conducted a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 7,481 individuals with bipolar disorder (cases) and 9,250 controls as part of the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium. Our replication study tested 34 SNPs in 4,496 independent cases with bipolar disorder and 42,422 independent controls and found that 18 of 34 SNPs had P < 0.05, with 31 of 34 SNPs having signals with the same direction of effect (P = 3.8 × 10(-7)). An analysis of all 11,974 bipolar disorder cases and 51,792 controls confirmed genome-wide significant evidence of association for CACNA1C and identified a new intronic variant in ODZ4. We identified a pathway comprised of subunits of calcium channels enriched in bipolar disorder association intervals. Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4. Our replication results imply that increasing sample sizes in bipolar disorder will confirm many additional loci.	 10025441 11315092 15744031 17081980 17554300 17701901 17924348 17486107 18317468 19002139 19150704 18711365 19144440 19114987 19088739 19339359 19416921 19488044 19571811 19952088 19781653 20098439 20679588 20451256 20819988 19621016 21057379 21353194 10465107 11252650
21940522	Genome-wide association scan for childhood caries implicates novel genes.	Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children and a major public health concern due to its increasing incidence, serious health and social co-morbidities, and socio-demographic disparities in disease burden. We performed the first genome-wide association scan for dental caries to identify associated genetic loci and nominate candidate genes affecting tooth decay in 1305 US children ages 3-12 yrs. Affection status was defined as 1 or more primary teeth with evidence of decay based on intra-oral examination. No associations met strict criteria for genome-wide significance (p < 10E-7); however, several loci (ACTN2, MTR, and EDARADD, MPPED2, and LPO) with plausible biological roles in dental caries exhibited suggestive evidence for association. Analyses stratified by home fluoride level yielded additional suggestive loci, including TFIP11 in the low-fluoride group, and EPHA7 and ZMPSTE24 in the sufficient-fluoride group. Suggestive loci were tested but not significantly replicated in an independent sample (N = 1695, ages 2-7 yrs) after adjustment for multiple comparisons. This study reinforces the complexity of dental caries, suggesting that numerous loci, mostly having small effects, are involved in cariogenesis. Verification/replication of suggestive loci may highlight biological mechanisms and/or pathways leading to a fuller understanding of the genetic risks for dental caries.	 20932398 14682644 18522740 6946738 20487000 16712703 17355248 7298182 9775475 16040727 20050376 15517401 20091798 11775787 10806191 15080365 12949310 3165997 18042988 17701901 20858777 11474917 20516689 19627672 14685227 12913070
21926416	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci predisposing to cutaneous melanoma.	We performed a multistage genome-wide association study of melanoma. In a discovery cohort of 1804 melanoma cases and 1026 controls, we identified loci at chromosomes 15q13.1 (HERC2/OCA2 region) and 16q24.3 (MC1R) regions that reached genome-wide significance within this study and also found strong evidence for genetic effects on susceptibility to melanoma from markers on chromosome 9p21.3 in the p16/ARF region and on chromosome 1q21.3 (ARNT/LASS2/ANXA9 region). The most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15q13.1 locus (rs1129038 and rs12913832) lie within a genomic region that has profound effects on eye and skin color; notably, 50% of variability in eye color is associated with variation in the SNP rs12913832. Because eye and skin colors vary across European populations, we further evaluated the associations of the significant SNPs after carefully adjusting for European substructure. We also evaluated the top 10 most significant SNPs by using data from three other genome-wide scans. Additional in silico data provided replication of the findings from the most significant region on chromosome 1q21.3 rs7412746 (P = 6 × 10(-10)). Together, these data identified several candidate genes for additional studies to identify causal variants predisposing to increased risk for developing melanoma.	 11161984 21685461 16462187 16759158 16982779 17554300 17529973 17701901 17952075 18252222 18483556 18488026 18488027 19578364 19340012 19585149 19707526 19887461 20023648 19710684 20304803 20091798 20571735 20406683 21430779 11954565

Identification of these 16 new loci may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating pulmonary function and into molecular targets for future therapy to alleviate reduced lung function.	 11315092 17873877 8819439 20714348 16867312 20119533 9872837 3015971 15466377 19557161 17906084 20656943 21552263 20237344 17572673 1573363 19430479 20881960 17450233 11074013 17676998 21102462 20075150 19198609 20010834 15888697 17132052 19342411 19557189 16452599 15319434 19430480 10861898 20688255 11826162 19300482 11166216 19430483 16891397 20418889 12427867 18204446 21407268 18372903 17507545 20173748 20662065 20010835 10562324 20562874 16102056 19836008 19300500
21946351	A germline variant in the TP53 polyadenylation signal confers cancer susceptibility.	To identify new risk variants for cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, we performed a genome-wide association study of 16 million SNPs identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders. We imputed genotypes for 41,675 Illumina SNP chip-typed Icelanders and their relatives. In the discovery phase, the strongest signal came from rs78378222[C] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36, P = 5.2 × 10(-17)), which has a frequency of 0.0192 in the Icelandic population. We then confirmed this association in non-Icelandic samples (OR = 1.75, P = 0.0060; overall OR = 2.16, P = 2.2 × 10(-20)). rs78378222 is in the 3' untranslated region of TP53 and changes the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, resulting in impaired 3'-end processing of TP53 mRNA. Investigation of other tumor types identified associations of this SNP with prostate cancer (OR = 1.44, P = 2.4 × 10(-6)), glioma (OR = 2.35, P = 1.0 × 10(-5)) and colorectal adenoma (OR = 1.39, P = 1.6 × 10(-4)). However, we observed no effect for breast cancer, a common Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumor (OR = 1.06, P = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.27).	 11179997 20546211 15105499 6646217 3409256 8118819 17012270 17350573 17952075 18488027 18488028 18813320 18849993 19165921 19165225 19151717 19204208 19578363 19776747 19952748 20016592 19863502 12672316
21980494	Genetics of venous thrombosis: insights from a new genome wide association study.	Venous Thrombosis (VT) is a common multifactorial disease associated with a major public health burden. Genetics factors are known to contribute to the susceptibility of the disease but how many genes are involved and their contribution to VT risk still remain obscure. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with VT risk.	 20231535 11315092 18974171 12814979 21378988 16862161 15760987 20562875 17308338 12859034 17478679 19198611 19583818 21163921 19369658 21270443 19492150 14598854 16415888 19198609 21029358 12067914 17032933 19198612 20212171 21088011 15557412 20946148 18349091 20226436 11038326 17634449 13655060 16144795 17701901 15256419 9423247 20802025 21167468 20331949 20303064 19278955 19630821
21956439	Genome-wide association study of alcohol dependence implicates KIAA0040 on chromosome 1q.	Previous studies using SAGE (the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment) and COGA (the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets reported several risk loci for alcohol dependence (AD), which have not yet been well replicated independently or confirmed by functional studies. We combined these two data sets, now publicly available, to increase the study power, in order to identify replicable, functional, and significant risk regions for AD. A total of 4116 subjects (1409 European-American (EA) cases with AD, 1518 EA controls, 681 African-American (AA) cases, and 508 AA controls) underwent association analysis. An additional 443 subjects underwent expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. Genome-wide association analysis was performed in EAs to identify significant risk genes. All available markers in the genome-wide significant risk genes were tested in AAs for associations with AD, and in six HapMap populations and two European samples for associations with gene expression levels. We identified a unique genome-wide significant gene--KIAA0040--that was enriched with many replicable risk SNPs for AD, all of which had significant cis-acting regulatory effects. The distributions of -log(p) values for SNP-disease and SNP-expression associations for all markers in the TNN-KIAA0040 region were consistent across EAs, AAs, and five HapMap populations (0.369 ≤ r ≤ 0.824; 2.8 × 10⁻⁹ ≤ p ≤ 0.032). The most significant SNPs in these populations were in high LD, concentrating in KIAA0040. Finally, expression of KIAA0040 was significantly (1.2 × 10⁻¹¹ ≤ p ≤1 .5 × 10⁻⁶) associated with the expression of numerous genes in the neurotransmitter systems or metabolic pathways previously associated with AD. We concluded that KIAA0040 might harbor a causal variant for AD and thus might directly contribute to risk for this disorder. KIAA0040 might also contribute to the risk of AD via neurotransmitter systems or metabolic pathways that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Alternatively, KIAA0040 might regulate the risk via some interactions with flanking genes TNN and TNR. TNN is involved in neurite outgrowth and cell migration in hippocampal explants, and TNR is an extracellular matrix protein expressed primarily in the central nervous system.	 15722952 15194200 16685648 16362079 17362836 17454860 17554300 17701901 21471458 21529783 21703634 17641165 17998437 17622222 18820697 18828801 19222302 19581569 18521090 19874574 20202923 20354512 20201924 15770103 10835412 11918988 12022963 12766633 12824337
21980299	A genome-wide meta-analysis of six type 1 diabetes cohorts identifies multiple associated loci.	Diabetes impacts approximately 200 million people worldwide, of whom approximately 10% are affected by type 1 diabetes (T1D). The application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has robustly revealed dozens of genetic contributors to the pathogenesis of T1D, with the most recent meta-analysis identifying in excess of 40 loci. To identify additional genetic loci for T1D susceptibility, we examined associations in the largest meta-analysis to date between the disease and ∼2.54 million SNPs in a combined cohort of 9,934 cases and 16,956 controls. Targeted follow-up of 53 SNPs in 1,120 affected trios uncovered three new loci associated with T1D that reached genome-wide significance. The most significantly associated SNP (rs539514, P = 5.66×10⁻¹¹) resides in an intronic region of the LMO7 (LIM domain only 7) gene on 13q22. The second most significantly associated SNP (rs478222, P = 3.50×10⁻⁹ resides in an intronic region of the EFR3B (protein EFR3 homolog B) gene on 2p23; however, the region of linkage disequilibrium is approximately 800 kb and harbors additional multiple genes, including NCOA1, C2orf79, CENPO, ADCY3, DNAJC27, POMC, and DNMT3A. The third most significantly associated SNP (rs924043, P = 8.06×10⁻⁹ lies in an intergenic region on 6q27, where the region of association is approximately 900 kb and harbors multiple genes including WDR27, C6orf120, PHF10, TCTE3, C6orf208, LOC154449, DLL1, FAM120B, PSMB1, TBP, and PCD2. These latest associated regions add to the growing repertoire of gene networks predisposing to T1D.	 19068148 15504986 17676041 18198356 18978792 19465406 16862161 18391951 12401728 10651256 20827270 12499305 12724780 17395754 20176734 19715440 15834548 20881960 8817351 19073967 18840781 20935630 19584936 10752702 20378605 6363172 19966805 21102463 19801982 19956107 15297300 17606874 15579786 17554260 19430480 7773291 15608248 19956108 11196709 17067998 17554300 20634204 17701901 9054944 17632545 18647951 15004560 19838195 19110536 11317668 19146692 15220214 15247916 12761045 18455228 15776395
22004137	A genome-wide association study with DNA pooling identifies the variant rs11866328 in the GRIN2A gene that affects disease progression of chronic HBV infection.	Host genetics play a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To identify novel susceptibility loci to HBV progression, we carried out a genome-wide association study with DNA pooling. This study assessed the relationship between 8 highly-ranked SNPs selected from our DNA pool and disease progression of HBV infection in two independent case-control studies. The first population included 628 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) and 1729 progressed HBV carriers recruited from Hubei Province in south China. The second population was composed of 226 AsC and 215 progressed HBV carriers recruited from Shandong Province in north China. Of the 8 SNPs, variant rs11866328 (G/T), located in the glutamate receptor ionotropic N-methyl D-aspartate 2A (GRIN2A) gene, was replicated and had significant associations with disease progression of HBV infection in the DNA pooling stage both in the Hubei (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.34,2.02; p=1.96 × 10(-6); additive model), and in the Shandong (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.14,2.65; p=1.00×10(-2); additive model) population. Polymorphism rs11866328 in the GRIN2A gene might be a genetic variant underlying the susceptibility of HBV carriers to disease progression.	
21964575	Mutations in BRIP1 confer high risk of ovarian cancer.	Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. Sixteen million sequence variants, identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders, were imputed to 41,675 Icelanders genotyped using SNP chips, as well as to their relatives. Sequence variants were tested for association with ovarian cancer (N of affected individuals = 656). We discovered a rare (0.41% allelic frequency) frameshift mutation, c.2040_2041insTT, in the BRIP1 (FANCJ) gene that confers an increase in ovarian cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 8.13, P = 2.8 × 10(-14)). The mutation was also associated with increased risk of cancer in general and reduced lifespan by 3.6 years. In a Spanish population, another frameshift mutation in BRIP1, c.1702_1703del, was seen in 2 out of 144 subjects with ovarian cancer and 1 out of 1,780 control subjects (P = 0.016). This allele was also associated with breast cancer (seen in 6/927 cases; P = 0.0079). Ovarian tumors from heterozygous carriers of the Icelandic mutation show loss of the wild-type allele, indicating that BRIP1 behaves like a classical tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer.	 16153896 19165921 20852632 17033622 15571962 8673089 21378987 17568781 17572673 20852633 19648919 17664283 16116423 9579428 16116424 11301010 11039575 7942844 16116421 19383375 21351269 9637117 16360201 12053178 19451168 21983786 14576433 8589730 21345144
21971053	Genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease in the Japanese.	A new understanding of the genetic basis of coronary artery disease (CAD) has recently emerged from genome-wide association (GWA) studies of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thus far performed mostly in European-descent populations. To identify novel susceptibility gene variants for CAD and confirm those previously identified mostly in populations of European descent, a multistage GWA study was performed in the Japanese. In the discovery phase, we first genotyped 806 cases and 1337 controls with 451 382 SNP markers and subsequently assessed 34 selected SNPs with direct genotyping (541 additional cases) and in silico comparison (964 healthy controls). In the replication phase, involving 3052 cases and 6335 controls, 12 SNPs were tested; CAD association was replicated and/or verified for 4 (of 12) SNPs from 3 loci: near BRAP and ALDH2 on 12q24 (P=1.6 × 10(-34)), HLA-DQB1 on 6p21 (P=4.7 × 10(-7)), and CDKN2A/B on 9p21 (P=6.1 × 10(-16)). On 12q24, we identified the strongest association signal with the strength of association substantially pronounced for a subgroup of myocardial infarction cases (P=1.4 × 10(-40)). On 6p21, an HLA allele, DQB1(*)0604, could show one of the most prominent association signals in an ∼8-Mb interval that encompasses the LTA gene, where an association with myocardial infarction had been reported in another Japanese study. CAD association was also identified at CDKN2A/B, as previously reported in different populations of European descent and Asians. Thus, three loci confirmed in the Japanese GWA study highlight the likely presence of risk alleles with two types of genetic effects - population specific and common - on susceptibility to CAD.	 21378988 21239051 21572416 11315092 12452318 12426569 15129282 9808796 16260175 16415888 16891216 16998491 17357068 17554300 17701901 18048766 18787169 19200528 19198608 19198609 19198610 19198611 19198612 18979498 19307593 19401414 19820697 20084173 19726041 20208533 20219748 20395598 20571251 20141563 20971364 21378990
21979947	A genome-wide association study identifies a potential novel gene locus for keratoconus, one of the commonest causes for corneal transplantation in developed countries.	Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea progressively thins over time, and is a major cause for cornea transplantation. To identify keratoconus susceptibility regions, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a discovery and replication design. A discovery panel of 222 keratoconus Caucasian patients and 3324 Caucasian controls was genotyped using Illumina 370K beadchips. Further associated and fine-mapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n= 4905) were genotyped in an independent replication case-control panel of 304 cases and 518 controls and a family panel of 307 subjects in 70 families. Logistic regression models implemented in PLINK were performed to test associations in case-control samples with and without principal component (PC) adjustments. Generalized estimation equation models accounting for familial correlations implemented in GWAF were used for association testing in families. No genome-wide associations were identified in the discovery GWAS panel. From the initial testing without adjustments for PCs, the top three SNPs located at 3p26 (rs6442925), 2q21.3 (rs4954218) and 19q13.3 (rs1428642) were identified with unadjusted P-values of 6.5 × 10(-8), 2.4 × 10(-7) and 3.1 × 10(-7), respectively. After adjustments for PCs, rs1428642 became the most significant through the genome with a P-value of 1.4 × 10(-6), while rs6442925 and rs4954218 were less significant (P= 1.9 × 10(-5) and 2.6 × 10(-4)). SNP rs4954218 was confirmed in two independent replication panels with P-values of 0.004 and 0.009, respectively. Meta-analysis revealed a highest association at rs4954218 with adjusted P= 1.6 × 10(-7) (unadjusted P= 1.2 × 10(-9)). These findings suggest SNP rs4954218, located near the RAB3GAP1 gene, previously reported to be associated with corneal malformation, is a potential susceptibility locus for keratoconus.	 8302548 1669507 8528916 9030515 9493273 15623752 15635082 15297300 15696165 15790884 15761122 18216574 18978346 20031568 20040588 20485516 20811162 20634204 20512159 20719862 21060863 21139977 21098505 21175380 15838508 16024971 16532399 16768648 16862161 16936089 16938560 17210850 17701901 17943122 10865125 10951465 11778802 11978762 12073017 12356819 12167638 12605045 14685227 14985379 3513592 3337200 3344216 2183122 7955302
21998597	Genetic determinants of serum testosterone concentrations in men.	Testosterone concentrations in men are associated with cardiovascular morbidity, osteoporosis, and mortality and are affected by age, smoking, and obesity. Because of serum testosterone's high heritability, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in 8,938 men from seven cohorts and followed up the genome-wide significant findings in one in silico (n = 871) and two de novo replication cohorts (n = 4,620) to identify genetic loci significantly associated with serum testosterone concentration in men. All these loci were also associated with low serum testosterone concentration defined as <300 ng/dl. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) locus (17p13-p12) were identified as independently associated with serum testosterone concentration (rs12150660, p = 1.2×10(-41) and rs6258, p = 2.3×10(-22)). Subjects with ≥ 3 risk alleles of these variants had 6.5-fold higher risk of having low serum testosterone than subjects with no risk allele. The rs5934505 polymorphism near FAM9B on the X chromosome was also associated with testosterone concentrations (p = 5.6×10(-16)). The rs6258 polymorphism in exon 4 of SHBG affected SHBG's affinity for binding testosterone and the measured free testosterone fraction (p<0.01). Genetic variants in the SHBG locus and on the X chromosome are associated with a substantial variation in testosterone concentrations and increased risk of low testosterone. rs6258 is the first reported SHBG polymorphism, which affects testosterone binding to SHBG and the free testosterone fraction and could therefore influence the calculation of free testosterone using law-of-mass-action equation.	 11297579 21087174 12213195 12958120 14671199 6193907 3338188 9543161 15901667 16394089 16704558 16926255 17148559 17825717 17911176 18348202 18598274 18270261 19321131 19263227 19534810 19351733 19401373 19581420 19574343 19933169 20061333 20525905 20164245 20554979 20592293 20504090 20562628 11473114
21998595	Identification, replication, and fine-mapping of Loci associated with adult height in individuals of african ancestry.	Adult height is a classic polygenic trait of high heritability (h(2) approximately 0.8). More than 180 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified mostly in populations of European descent, are associated with height. These variants convey modest effects and explain approximately10% of the variance in height. Discovery efforts in other populations, while limited, have revealed loci for height not previously implicated in individuals of European ancestry. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) results for adult height in 20,427 individuals of African ancestry with replication in up to 16,436 African Americans. We found two novel height loci (Xp22-rs12393627, P = 3.4×10(-12) and 2p14-rs4315565, P = 1.2×10(-8)). As a group, height associations discovered in European-ancestry samples replicate in individuals of African ancestry (P = 1.7×10(-4) for overall replication). Fine-mapping of the European height loci in African-ancestry individuals showed an enrichment of SNPs that are associated with expression of nearby genes when compared to the index European height SNPs (P<0.01). Our results highlight the utility of genetic studies in non-European populations to understand the etiology of complex human diseases and traits.	 12598898 21407268 16494531 16565746 17503322 17559308 17767157 18193045 19396169 19543370 19838192 19839041 20027299 19893584 20189936 20400458 20811451 20634204 20881960 21194676 21347282
21981779	Variants near FOXE1 are associated with hypothyroidism and other thyroid conditions: using electronic medical records for genome- and phenome-wide studies.	We repurposed existing genotypes in DNA biobanks across the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network to perform a genome-wide association study for primary hypothyroidism, the most common thyroid disease. Electronic selection algorithms incorporating billing codes, laboratory values, text queries, and medication records identified 1317 cases and 5053 controls of European ancestry within five electronic medical records (EMRs); the algorithms' positive predictive values were 92.4% and 98.5% for cases and controls, respectively. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium at 9q22 near FOXE1 were associated with hypothyroidism at genome-wide significance, the strongest being rs7850258 (odds ratio [OR] 0.74, p = 3.96 × 10(-9)). This association was replicated in a set of 263 cases and 1616 controls (OR = 0.60, p = 5.7 × 10(-6)). A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) that was performed on this locus with 13,617 individuals and more than 200,000 patient-years of billing data identified associations with additional phenotypes: thyroiditis (OR = 0.58, p = 1.4 × 10(-5)), nodular (OR = 0.76, p = 3.1 × 10(-5)) and multinodular (OR = 0.69, p = 3.9 × 10(-5)) goiters, and thyrotoxicosis (OR = 0.76, p = 1.5 × 10(-3)), but not Graves disease (OR = 1.03, p = 0.82). Thyroid cancer, previously associated with this locus, was not significantly associated in the PheWAS (OR = 1.29, p = 0.09). The strongest association in the PheWAS was hypothyroidism (OR = 0.76, p = 2.7 × 10(-13)), which had an odds ratio that was nearly identical to that of the curated case-control population in the primary analysis, providing further validation of the PheWAS method. Our findings indicate that EMR-linked genomic data could allow discovery of genes associated with many diseases without additional genotyping cost.	 21211616 21041692 21269473 21367965 21311165 21587298 21323596 21700265 21879469 21757724 21248726 10690851 10835412 12100074 12107228 12629121 12727986 12724780 12786749 3841752 8481068 8649497 9214635 9697704 9697705 9794308 10329730 15719322 15863666 16381988 16501178 16862161 17167244 17701901 17717707 18177256 18434655 18514160 18500243 18579832 19014322 18974171 19197348 19198613 19474294 19521098 19067720 19648918 19908384 19779022 20103030 20101243 20351906 20362271 20335276 20350937 20604685 20235204 20616382 20634204 20826269 20927387 21322126
21983785	Genome-wide association study identifies a new melanoma susceptibility locus at 1q21.3.	We performed a genome-wide association study of melanoma in a discovery cohort of 2,168 Australian individuals with melanoma and 4,387 control individuals. In this discovery phase, we confirm several previously characterized melanoma-associated loci at MC1R, ASIP and MTAP-CDKN2A. We selected variants at nine loci for replication in three independent case-control studies (Europe: 2,804 subjects with melanoma, 7,618 control subjects; United States 1: 1,804 subjects with melanoma, 1,026 control subjects; United States 2: 585 subjects with melanoma, 6,500 control subjects). The combined meta-analysis of all case-control studies identified a new susceptibility locus at 1q21.3 (rs7412746, P = 9.0 × 10(-11), OR in combined replication cohorts of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.95)). We also show evidence suggesting that melanoma associates with 1q42.12 (rs3219090, P = 9.3 × 10(-8)). The associated variants at the 1q21.3 locus span a region with ten genes, and plausible candidate genes for melanoma susceptibility include ARNT and SETDB1. Variants at the 1q21.3 locus do not seem to be associated with human pigmentation or measures of nevus density.	 20562874 19887461 20634204 20981092 20837404 5106369 21430779 16621887 15053858 17516929 17701901 18361720 18488026 18488027 19578364 19578365 16862161 20602913
21983787	Genome-wide association study identifies three new melanoma susceptibility loci.	We report a genome-wide association study for melanoma that was conducted by the GenoMEL Consortium. Our discovery phase included 2,981 individuals with melanoma and 1,982 study-specific control individuals of European ancestry, as well as an additional 6,426 control subjects from French or British populations, all of whom were genotyped for 317,000 or 610,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our analysis replicated previously known melanoma susceptibility loci. Seven new regions with at least one SNP with P < 10(-5) and further local imputed or genotyped support were selected for replication using two other genome-wide studies (from Australia and Texas, USA). Additional replication came from case-control series from the UK and The Netherlands. Variants at three of the seven loci replicated at P < 10(-3): an SNP in ATM (rs1801516, overall P = 3.4 × 10(-9)), an SNP in MX2 (rs45430, P = 2.9 × 10(-9)) and an SNP adjacent to CASP8 (rs13016963, P = 8.6 × 10(-10)). A fourth locus near CCND1 remains of potential interest, showing suggestive but inconclusive evidence of replication (rs1485993, overall P = 4.6 × 10(-7) under a fixed-effects model and P = 1.2 × 10(-3) under a random-effects model). These newly associated variants showed no association with nevus or pigmentation phenotypes in a large British case-control series.	 1869281 7741122 7741123 8664138 15761869 16029848 16291983 16982779 17266119 18366057 18483556 18488026 18488027 18563784 18683857 18813293 18792098 19151717 19384953 19578364 19578365 19710684 20176653 20478107 20602913 20647408 20634204
21983786	Identification of low-frequency variants associated with gout and serum uric acid levels.	We tested 16 million SNPs, identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders, for association with gout and serum uric acid levels. Genotypes were imputed into 41,675 chip-genotyped Icelanders and their relatives, for effective sample sizes of 968 individuals with gout and 15,506 individuals for whom serum uric acid measurements were available. We identified a low-frequency missense variant (c.1580C>G) in ALDH16A1 associated with gout (OR = 3.12, P = 1.5 × 10(-16), at-risk allele frequency = 0.019) and serum uric acid levels (effect = 0.36 s.d., P = 4.5 × 10(-21)). We confirmed the association with gout by performing Sanger sequencing on 6,017 Icelanders. The association with gout was stronger in males relative to females. We also found a second variant on chromosome 1 associated with gout (OR = 1.92, P = 0.046, at-risk allele frequency = 0.986) and serum uric acid levels (effect = 0.48 s.d., P = 4.5 × 10(-16)). This variant is close to a common variant previously associated with serum uric acid levels. This work illustrates how whole-genome sequencing data allow the detection of associations between low-frequency variants and complex traits.	 7660963 19165921 17522099 17012270 21378987 8751865 10798367 17572673 10068714 18611112 14744114 19503597 16004729 14517540 18327256 19571808 15237855 15936302 16204163 16934002 19357536 18794855 20110790 18327257 11701630 19451168 20884846 15647434 18179892 17997608
21990027	The genetics of antipsychotic induced tremors: a genome-wide pathway analysis on the STEP-BD SCP sample.	Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are associated with antipsychotic treatment. The exact definition of the genetic variants that influence the antipsychotic induced EPS would dramatically increase the quality of antipsychotic prescriptions. We investigated this issue in a subsample of the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). Four hundred nine manic patients were treated with antipsychotics and had complete clinical and genetic data. Outcome was an item of the Clinical Monitoring Form which scored tremors from 0 to 4 at each clinical visit. Visits were scheduled according to clinical issues, based on a naturalistic approach. A genomic inflation factor of 1.017 resulted after genetic quality control. Single SNPs GWAS (Plink) and molecular pathway GWAS were conducted (SNP ratio test, KEGG depository). No single SNP reached GWAS significance level of association. Molecular pathways related to cell survival events and lipid synthesis were significantly associated with antipsychotic induced EPS (P = 0.0009 for Hsa04512, Hsa01031, Hsa00230, Hsa04510, Hsa03320, Hsa04930, and Hsa04115; P = 0.0019 for Hsa04020 and Hsa00561). This finding was consistent with previous GWAS studies.	
21993531	Genome-wide association study does not reveal major genetic determinants for anti-cytomegalovirus antibody response.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes an infection, which is followed by a lifelong latency. CMV has received much attention in clinical studies, but little is known about the genetic basis of this common infection. To identify genetic polymorphisms associated with the susceptibility to and strength of anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to CMV infection, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using an Illumina BeadChip containing 670 000 probes and participants from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, including 1486 anti-CMV IgG seropositive and 648 seronegative individuals. Statistical analyses were performed using logistic (for susceptibility) and linear regression (for strength of antibody response). None of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was found to be associated with susceptibility to CMV infection at the level of genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)). Also, none of the association signals identified reached genome-wide levels of statistical significance in the study of the strength of the antibody response to CMV although five SNPs in AGBL1 gene region displayed a suggestive association (lowest P-value=1.86 × 10(-6)). The results indicate that there is no strong evidence of major host genetic factors involved in either susceptibility to or the strength of antibody response to human CMV infection.

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) generates proinflammatory and proatherogenic compounds in the arterial vascular wall and is a potential therapeutic target in coronary heart disease (CHD). We searched for genetic loci related to Lp-PLA2 mass or activity by a genome-wide association study as part of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium.	 10733466 20923989 11855950 14757686 15115767 15502096 8675689 9392426 15731492 16960105 17102149 21490708 21303902 21982651 17634449 18193043 18193044 18262040 18204052 18348202 18714375 18765397 18806801 18983494 19207020 19135199 19380133 19797705 20031568 20435228 20442857 20479152 20686565 20616382 20934559 11518768
22001756	Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for dengue shock syndrome at MICB and PLCE1.	Hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome (DSS)) is the most common life-threatening complication of dengue. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 2,008 pediatric cases treated for DSS and 2,018 controls from Vietnam. Replication of the most significantly associated markers was carried out in an independent Vietnamese sample of 1,737 cases and 2,934 controls. SNPs at two loci showed genome-wide significant association with DSS. We identified a susceptibility locus at MICB (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence B), which was within the broad MHC region on chromosome 6 but outside the class I and class II HLA loci (rs3132468, P(meta) = 4.41 × 10(-11), per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.46)). We identified associated variants within PLCE1 (phospholipase C, epsilon 1) on chromosome 10 (rs3765524, P(meta) = 3.08 × 10(-10), per-allele OR = 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.86)). We identify two loci associated with susceptibility to DSS in people with dengue, suggesting possible mechanisms for this severe complication of dengue.	 10608744 21499248 11709777 12001037 12076887 12363051 12472660 9665979 15297300 15728868 15807802 15838506 15894612 16862161 17086182 17352422 17701901 18602338 18986209 19392621 19330030 19911991 19915573 19929380 20228799 20630553 20943967 21212214 21131975 21390158 21399635 11491531
22001757	Genome-wide association study identifies loci influencing concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma.	Concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma are widely used as indicators of liver disease. We carried out a genome-wide association study in 61,089 individuals, identifying 42 loci associated with concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma, of which 32 are new associations (P = 10(-8) to P = 10(-190)). We used functional genomic approaches including metabonomic profiling and gene expression analyses to identify probable candidate genes at these regions. We identified 69 candidate genes, including genes involved in biliary transport (ATP8B1 and ABCB11), glucose, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (FADS1, FADS2, GCKR, JMJD1C, HNF1A, MLXIPL, PNPLA3, PPP1R3B, SLC2A2 and TRIB1), glycoprotein biosynthesis and cell surface glycobiology (ABO, ASGR1, FUT2, GPLD1 and ST3GAL4), inflammation and immunity (CD276, CDH6, GCKR, HNF1A, HPR, ITGA1, RORA and STAT4) and glutathione metabolism (GSTT1, GSTT2 and GGT), as well as several genes of uncertain or unknown function (including ABHD12, EFHD1, EFNA1, EPHA2, MICAL3 and ZNF827). Our results provide new insight into genetic mechanisms and pathways influencing markers of liver function.	 12537873 17463246 19474294 20971884 17873877 17254420 18075776 16862161 18776911 19043545 17658951 21179014 20826584 19209234 17254406 17943122 17876813 19684899 18344981 16907705 19430479 18462017 21057674 20686565 21294994 15300568 20581827 16799980 10973998 16399403 19615119 20383145 20935630 1353662 9500542 14967068 9403910 9716655 15504965 12692541 19557189 20937632 18940312 10781624 12404240 20014114 20034933 16628637 20037589 16032512 17667992 19430483 20139978 16918316 21471458 18372903 18348202 20981092 18366642 20032323 19567438 20298560 16871584 20016592 19060910 15805049 19728115 19581420 18179892 21423719 15239083 20081858
22006218	Large-scale genome-wide association study of Asian population reveals genetic factors in FRMD4A and other loci influencing smoking initiation and nicotine dependence.	Diseases related to smoking are the second leading cause of death in the world. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for several diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. Despite increasing evidence of genetic determination, the susceptibility genes and loci underlying various aspects of smoking behavior are largely unknown. Moreover, almost all reported genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed on samples of European origin, limiting the applicability of the results to other ethnic populations. In this first GWAS on smoking behavior in an Asian population, after analyzing 8,842 DNA samples from the Korea Association Resource project with 352,228 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped for each sample, we identified 8 SNPs significantly associated with smoking initiation (SI) and 4 with nicotine dependence (ND). Because of the current unavailability of an independent Asian smoking sample, we replicated the discoveries in independent samples of European-American and African-American origin. Of the 12 SNPs examined in the replicated samples, we identified two SNPs, in the regulator of G-protein signaling 17 gene (rs7747583, p value(meta) = 6.40 × 10(-6); rs2349433, p value(meta) = 5.57 × 10(-6)), associated with SI. Also, we found two SNPs significantly associated with ND; one in the FERM domain containing 4A (rs4424567, p value(meta) = 2.30 × 10(-6)) and the other at 7q31.1 (rs848353, p value(meta) = 9.16 × 10(-8)). These SNPs represent novel targets for examination of smoking behavior and warrant further investigation using independent samples.	 9429194 1508241 15879433 16960812 17158188 17407593 17572673 17701901 17903302 18021906 17904174 18219269 18205015 18227835 18385739 18519826 18626235 18686737 18937294 18951430 19043545 18711365 19122664 19094236 19247474 19268276 19238175 19396169 19188921 19734545 19915572 19915573 20031603 20080746 20418888 20418889 20418890 20400778 20808433 20811658 20306291 20351715 21685187 20228799 10795363 12492752 12925516 1932883 15790597
22010048	A genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus for renal cell carcinoma on 12p11.23.	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal urologic cancer. Only two common susceptibility loci for RCC have been confirmed to date. To identify additional RCC common susceptibility loci, we conducted an independent genome-wide association study (GWAS). We analyzed 533 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with RCC in 894 cases and 1516 controls of European descent recruited from MD Anderson Cancer Center in the primary scan, and validated the top 500 SNPs in silico in 3772 cases and 8505 controls of European descent involved in the only published GWAS of RCC. We identified two common variants in linkage disequilibrium, rs718314 and rs1049380 (r(2) = 0.64, D ' = 0.84), in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, type 2 (ITPR2) gene on 12p11.23 as novel susceptibility loci for RCC (P = 8.89 × 10(-10) and P = 6.07 × 10(-9), respectively, in meta-analysis) with an allelic odds ratio of 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.26] for rs718314 and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12-1.25) for rs1049380. It has been recently identified that rs718314 in ITPR2 is associated with waist-hip ratio (WHR) phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic locus associated with both cancer risk and WHR.	 18544571 21131975 18981534 17233576 16195467 19402075 19240244 20610543 17615089 17591592 20935629 19824817 19455236 9116091 15297300 18836333 19648920 20448658 19543373
21989058	Association of 8q22.3 locus in Chinese Han with idiopathic premature ovarian failure (POF).	Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a complex heritable disorder known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities and to date a limited number of known mutations, often autosomal. We sought to identify additional genetic loci associated with POF by performing the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS, using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chip, was conducted in an initial discovery set of 391 well-documented (follicle-stimulating hormone >40 IU/ml) Chinese Han POF patients, compared with 895 unrelated Chinese female controls. A replication study on the most significant loci was then performed in an independent set of 400 cases and 800 controls. Suggestive significant associations were observed at 8q22.3. Replication of eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10464815, rs10808365, rs3847152, rs3847153, rs3847154, rs3843552, rs10955242, rs3843555) (P ≤ 3.86 × 10(-6)) was confirmed in verification sets. No specific candidate gene was found in the immediate region of 8q22.3. This GWAS, involving by far the largest sample of POF cases accumulated to date, revealed heretofore unrecognized association between POF and a novel genetic locus or region of unknown nature on 8q22.3. We speculate existence of a long-distance regulatory region that has relevance to the control of ovarian differentiation or oogenesis. Given failure to find association with any of the other autosomal regions known to harbor genes causing ovarian failure, our findings also underscore the likelihood of considerable genetic and etiologic heterogeneity in POF and the need for additional approaches like whole-genome sequencing.	
22004471	Genome-wide significant association between alcohol dependence and a variant in the ADH gene cluster.	Alcohol dependence (AD) is an important contributory factor to the global burden of disease. The etiology of AD involves both environmental and genetic factors, and the disorder has a heritability of around 50%. The aim of the present study was to identify susceptibility genes for AD by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The sample comprised 1333 male in-patients with severe AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and 2168 controls. These included 487 patients and 1358 controls from a previous GWAS study by our group. All individuals were of German descent. Single-marker tests and a polygenic score-based analysis to assess the combined contribution of multiple markers with small effects were performed. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1789891, which is located between the ADH1B and ADH1C genes, achieved genome-wide significance [P = 1.27E-8, odds ratio (OR) = 1.46]. Other markers from this region were also associated with AD, and conditional analyses indicated that these made a partially independent contribution. The SNP rs1789891 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the functional Arg272Gln variant (P = 1.24E-7, OR = 1.31) of the ADH1C gene, which has been reported to modify the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde in vitro. A polygenic score-based approach produced a significant result (P = 9.66E-9). This is the first GWAS of AD to provide genome-wide significant support for the role of the ADH gene cluster and to suggest a polygenic component to the etiology of AD. The latter result may indicate that many more AD susceptibility genes still await identification.	 11858627 21497796 2024727 1471556 8529532 9715572 15297300 16255080 16702894 16534506 17010097 17194218 17701901 17718394 17718397 17898773 17924348 18042191 18846501 18996923 19193628 19581569 19571811 20202923 20201924 20562875 21040237 12050823

The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly determined by genetic factors and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes for the disease risk. In addition to the disease risk, age-at-onset (AAO) of AD has also strong genetic component with an estimated heritability of 42%. Identification of AAO genes may help to understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the onset of the disease. Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis on three samples comprising a total of 2222 AD cases. A total of ~2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in relation to AAO of AD. As expected, the most significant associations were observed in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) region on chromosome 19 where several SNPs surpassed the conservative genome-wide significant threshold (P<5E-08). The most significant SNP outside the APOE region was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 (rs1466662; P=4.95E-07). There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at P<1E-04 and the DCHS2 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex and thus is a potential candidate for affecting AAO in AD. These findings need to be confirmed in additional well-powered samples.	 11875758 12958120 15003449 7772075 7487559 9678314 16461860 16137793 17409192 17535852 17701901 18372903 18976728 19136949 19393635 19557197 19734902 19734903 20042704 20451872 20451875 20460622 20100581 20847397 19721433 21480501 21460840 21460841 10631151 10936055 11252006 11342683
22005930	Genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease with psychotic symptoms.	Psychotic symptoms occur in ~40% of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with more rapid cognitive decline and increased functional deficits. They show heritability up to 61% and have been proposed as a marker for a disease subtype suitable for gene mapping efforts. We undertook a combined analysis of three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify loci that (1) increase susceptibility to an AD and subsequent psychotic symptoms; or (2) modify risk of psychotic symptoms in the presence of neurodegeneration caused by AD. In all, 1299 AD cases with psychosis (AD+P), 735 AD cases without psychosis (AD-P) and 5659 controls were drawn from Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD Consortium 1 (GERAD1), the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-LOAD) family study and the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) GWASs. Unobserved genotypes were imputed to provide data on >1.8 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Analyses in each data set were completed comparing (1) AD+P to AD-P cases, and (2) AD+P cases with controls (GERAD1, ADRC only). Aside from the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus, the strongest evidence for association was observed in an intergenic region on chromosome 4 (rs753129; 'AD+PvAD-P' P=2.85 × 10(-7); 'AD+PvControls' P=1.11 × 10(-4)). SNPs upstream of SLC2A9 (rs6834555, P=3.0 × 10(-7)) and within VSNL1 (rs4038131, P=5.9 × 10(-7)) showed strongest evidence for association with AD+P when compared with controls. These findings warrant further investigation in larger, appropriately powered samples in which the presence of psychotic symptoms in AD has been well characterized.	 21460841 19571809 19781112 16135132 12938076 11315092 20081856 7114305 21461363 16862161 18677311 9153155 19455578 7991117 16927138 21186168 16263838 11914406 21093110 20957767 20061611 19001172 18703769 20157235 10520944 9727961 20558149 19150704 7653692 16970641 3249765 20534741 18711365 21820212 12740595 19734902 20616382 18814807 18184693 20064257 21300948 1202204 19329560 21460840 17525976 18852199 2011243 19734903 19571808 19521722 21379329 16009739 21353194 20554627 19812666 10720283 20460622 17701901 18327257 19034380 16138915 15956266 18989702 12837516 20570404 20147454 19571811 20558387 20697030 6610841 17492769
22013104	Genome-wide scan for loci of adolescent obesity and their relationship with blood pressure.	Hypertension, typically considered a disorder of adulthood, is now emerging in adolescence. This is mainly due to the growing prevalence of obesity and the fact that excess body fat increases blood pressure (BP).	
22012869	Genome-wide association study in German patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	The heritability of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is approximately 0.8. Despite several larger scale attempts, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not led to the identification of significant results. We performed a GWAS based on 495 German young patients with ADHD (according to DSM-IV criteria; Human660W-Quadv1; Illumina, San Diego, CA) and on 1,300 population-based adult controls (HumanHap550v3; Illumina). Some genes neighboring the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the lowest P-values (best P-value: 8.38 × 10(-7)) have potential relevance for ADHD (e.g., glutamate receptor, metabotropic 5 gene, GRM5). After quality control, the 30 independent SNPs with the lowest P-values (P-values ≤ 7.57 × 10(-5) ) were chosen for confirmation. Genotyping of these SNPs in up to 320 independent German families comprising at least one child with ADHD revealed directionally consistent effect-size point estimates for 19 (10 not consistent) of the SNPs. In silico analyses of the 30 SNPs in the largest meta-analysis so far (2,064 trios, 896 cases, and 2,455 controls) revealed directionally consistent effect-size point estimates for 16 SNPs (11 not consistent). None of the combined analyses revealed a genome-wide significant result. SNPs in previously described autosomal candidate genes did not show significantly lower P-values compared to SNPs within random sets of genes of the same size. We did not find genome-wide significant results in a GWAS of German children with ADHD compared to controls. The second best SNP is located in an intron of GRM5, a gene located within a recently described region with an infrequent copy number variation in patients with ADHD.	
22028671	A genome-wide screen for interactions reveals a new locus on 4p15 modifying the effect of waist-to-hip ratio on total cholesterol.	Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies described 95 loci controlling serum lipid levels. These common variants explain ∼25% of the heritability of the phenotypes. To date, no unbiased screen for gene-environment interactions for circulating lipids has been reported. We screened for variants that modify the relationship between known epidemiological risk factors and circulating lipid levels in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) data from 18 population-based cohorts with European ancestry (maximum N = 32,225). We collected 8 further cohorts (N = 17,102) for replication, and rs6448771 on 4p15 demonstrated genome-wide significant interaction with waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) on total cholesterol (TC) with a combined P-value of 4.79×10(-9). There were two potential candidate genes in the region, PCDH7 and CCKAR, with differential expression levels for rs6448771 genotypes in adipose tissue. The effect of WHR on TC was strongest for individuals carrying two copies of G allele, for whom a one standard deviation (sd) difference in WHR corresponds to 0.19 sd difference in TC concentration, while for A allele homozygous the difference was 0.12 sd. Our findings may open up possibilities for targeted intervention strategies for people characterized by specific genomic profiles. However, more refined measures of both body-fat distribution and metabolic measures are needed to understand how their joint dynamics are modified by the newly found locus.	 10861897 21179014 11855950 14569045 14740316 15379757 4337382 9072292 9530226 9751229 15637308 15716591 15974298 18348202 18570625 18852200 19005228 19684899 19927141 19820914 20233392 20686565 20838940 11702219

22021425	Genome-wide association study of body height in African Americans: the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe).	Height is a complex trait under strong genetic influence. To date, numerous genetic loci have been associated with height in individuals of European ancestry. However, few large-scale discovery genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of height in minority populations have been conducted and thus information about population-specific height regulation is limited. We conducted a GWA analysis of height in 8149 African-American (AA) women from the Women's Health Initiative. Genetic variants with P< 5 × 10(-5) (n = 169) were followed up in a replication data set (n = 20 809) and meta-analyzed in a total of 28 958 AAs and African-descent individuals. Twelve single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing 7 independent loci were significantly associated with height at P < 5 × 10(-8). We identified novel SNPs in 17q23 (TMEM100/PCTP) and Xp22.3 (ARSE) reflecting population-specific regulation of height in AAs and replicated five loci previously reported in European-descent populations [4p15/LCORL, 11q13/SERPINH1, 12q14/HMGA2, 17q23/MAP3K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase3) and 18q21/DYM]. In addition, we performed an admixture mapping analysis of height which is both complementary and supportive to the GWA analysis and suggests potential associations between ancestry and height on chromosomes 4 (4q21), 15 (15q26) and 17 (17q23). Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of height and support the investigation of non-European-descent populations for identifying genetic factors associated with complex traits. Specifically, we identify new loci that may reflect population-specific regulation of height and report several known height loci that are important in determining height in African-descent populations.	 18852204 18568023 18974171 19030899 19343178 19396169 19584881 19576566 19570815 19839041 19892779 19893584 20137780 20189936 20400458 20562875 20616382 20881960 21031451 21194676 21347282 20966902 21407268 21998595 18193045 10547143 11315092 11410839 11754475 11867360 12655557 6262212 9432120 9492970 16138910 16773560 16862161 17559308 17767157 18391950 18391951 18391952 18950892
22019778	Identification of two new loci at IL23R and RAB32 that influence susceptibility to leprosy.	We performed a genome-wide association study with 706 individuals with leprosy and 5,581 control individuals and replicated the top 24 SNPs in three independent replication samples, including a total of 3,301 individuals with leprosy and 5,299 control individuals from China. Two loci not previously associated with the disease were identified with genome-wide significance: rs2275606 (combined P = 3.94 × 10(-14), OR = 1.30) on 6q24.3 and rs3762318 (combined P = 3.27 × 10(-11), OR = 0.69) on 1p31.3. These associations implicate IL23R and RAB32 as new susceptibility genes for leprosy. Furthermore, we identified evidence of interaction between the NOD2 and RIPK2 loci, which is consistent with the biological association of the proteins encoded by these genes (NOD2-RIPK2 complex) in activating the NF-κB pathway as a part of the host defense response to infection. Our findings have expanded the biological functions of IL23R by uncovering its involvement in infectious disease susceptibility and suggest a potential involvement of autophagocytosis in leprosy pathogenesis. The IL23R association supports previous observations of the marked overlap of susceptibility genes for leprosy and Crohn's disease, implying common pathogenesis mechanisms.	 9921965 16862161 15687028 20018961 20622879 17982456 20830851 3802833 20526339 19169255 21255211 20953187 21666691 19906737 19200528 21102463 20228799 19592695 18587394 20116986 20694013 20953190 12023369 19838193 13655060 20702402 20617178 21134959 21399635 3549780 20694014
22019779	A genome-wide association study identifies common variants near LBX1 associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a pediatric spinal deformity affecting 2-3% of school-age children worldwide(1). Genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology(2). Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication study involving a total of 1,376 Japanese females with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and 11,297 female controls, we identified a locus at chromosome 10q24.31 associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis susceptibility. The most significant SNP (rs11190870; combined P = 1.24 × 10(-19); odds ratio (OR) = 1.56) is located near LBX1 (encoding ladybird homeobox 1). The identification of this susceptibility locus provides new insights into the pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.	 19092622 11501945 18794762 21102273 9306532 16234809 16778672 12062038 21327322 21293892 10635522 19337134 21308753 18985072 21216876 17632395 18634777 8645601 19340878 21460842 6284765 16648749 21520258 19424484 12062039 15457701 17475798 12522123 17108398 3206283 4760104
22032556	Susceptibility variants on chromosome 7p21.1 suggest HDAC9 as a new candidate gene for male-pattern baldness.	Male-pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia, AGA) is the most common form of hair loss among humans. Research has shown that it is caused by genetic factors. Numerous studies have unequivocally identified two major genetic risk loci for AGA: the X-chromosomal AR/EDA2R locus, and the PAX1/FOXA2 locus on chromosome 20.	
22037552	Genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia in Han Chinese at 11p11.2.	To identify susceptibility loci for schizophrenia, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population (GWAS: 746 individuals with schizophrenia and 1,599 healthy controls; validation: 4,027 individuals with schizophrenia and 5,603 healthy controls). We identified two susceptibility loci for schizophrenia at 6p21-p22.1 (rs1233710 in an intron of ZKSCAN4, P(combined) = 4.76 × 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 0.79; rs1635 in an exon of NKAPL, P(combined) = 6.91 × 10(-12), OR = 0.78; rs2142731 in an intron of PGBD1, P(combined) = 5.14 × 10(-10), OR = 0.79) and 11p11.2 (rs11038167 near the 5' UTR of TSPAN18, P(combined) = 1.09 × 10(-11), OR = 1.29; rs11038172, P(combined) = 7.21 × 10(-10), OR = 1.25; rs835784, P(combined) = 2.73 × 10(-11), OR = 1.27). These results add to previous evidence of susceptibility loci for schizophrenia at 6p21-p22.1 in the Han Chinese population. We found that NKAPL and ZKSCAN4 were expressed in postnatal day 0 (P0) mouse brain. These findings may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.	 11385502 19571809 19944404 16862161 12111919 18583979 20018961 18677311 12573388 20485568 14550261 3802833 10891034 19150704 12958120 19808789 16997531 19944401 19571808 17181773 14570575 13655060 20634204 17701901 18317468 19409814 21339752 19571811 17910948
22037553	A common variant at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus is associated with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.	Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer shows a higher incidence in women of African ancestry compared to women of European ancestry. In search of common risk alleles for ER-negative breast cancer, we combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from women of African ancestry (1,004 ER-negative cases and 2,745 controls) and European ancestry (1,718 ER-negative cases and 3,670 controls), with replication testing conducted in an additional 2,292 ER-negative cases and 16,901 controls of European ancestry. We identified a common risk variant for ER-negative breast cancer at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus on chromosome 5p15 (rs10069690: per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.18 per allele, P = 1.0 × 10(-10)). The variant was also significantly associated with triple-negative (ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2)-negative) breast cancer (OR = 1.25, P = 1.1 × 10(-9)), particularly in younger women (<50 years of age) (OR = 1.48, P = 1.9 × 10(-9)). Our results identify a genetic locus associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer subtypes in multiple populations.	 11553815 21131975 17529967 17618282 18264096 18794855 18978790 19578367 19704069 20478107 20453838 20628624 20852631 20852633 16757721
22037555	Common variants on 8p12 and 1q24.2 confer risk of schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder affecting ∼1% of the world population, with heritability of up to 80%. To identify new common genetic risk factors, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Han Chinese population. The discovery sample set consisted of 3,750 individuals with schizophrenia and 6,468 healthy controls (1,578 cases and 1,592 controls from northern Han Chinese, 1,238 cases and 2,856 controls from central Han Chinese, and 934 cases and 2,020 controls from the southern Han Chinese). We further analyzed the strongest association signals in an additional independent cohort of 4,383 cases and 4,539 controls from the Han Chinese population. Meta-analysis identified common SNPs that associated with schizophrenia with genome-wide significance on 8p12 (rs16887244, P = 1.27 × 10(-10)) and 1q24.2 (rs10489202, P = 9.50 × 10(-9)).

22037551	A genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for non-cardia gastric cancer at 3q13.31 and 5p13.1.	Gastric cancer, including the cardia and non-cardia types, is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To identify genetic risk variants for non-cardia gastric cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study in 3,279 individuals (1,006 with non-cardia gastric cancer and 2,273 controls) of Chinese descent. We replicated significant associations in an additional 6,897 subjects (3,288 with non-cardia gastric cancer and 3,609 controls). We identified two new susceptibility loci for non-cardia gastric cancer at 5p13.1 (rs13361707 in the region including PTGER4 and PRKAA1; odds ratio (OR) = 1.41; P = 7.6 × 10(-29)) and 3q13.31 (rs9841504 in ZBTB20; OR = 0.76; P = 1.7 × 10(-9)). Imputation analyses also confirmed previously reported associations of rs2294008 and rs2976392 on 8q24, rs4072037 on 1q22 and rs13042395 on 20p13 with non-cardia gastric cancer susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.	 15455378 21131975 16862161 12111919 17329241 20131315 17447842 12740571 20729852 11352661 19554573 9293918 20729853 18488030 18669658 19629071 15052270 21427165 17701901 12421872 12228765 11902583
22037903	Genetic variants associated with the white blood cell count in 13,923 subjects in the eMERGE Network.	White blood cell count (WBC) is unique among identified inflammatory predictors of chronic disease in that it is routinely measured in asymptomatic patients in the course of routine patient care. We led a genome-wide association analysis to identify variants associated with WBC levels in 13,923 subjects in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network. We identified two regions of interest that were each unique to subjects of genetically determined ancestry to the African continent (AA) or to the European continent (EA). WBC varies among different ancestry groups. Despite being ancestry specific, these regions were identifiable in the combined analysis. In AA subjects, the region surrounding the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene (DARC) on 1q21 exhibited significant association (p value = 6.71e-55). These results validate the previously reported association between WBC and of the regulatory variant rs2814778 in the promoter region, which causes the Duffy negative phenotype (Fy-/-). A second missense variant (rs12075) is responsible for the two principal antigens, Fya and Fyb of the Duffy blood group system. The two variants, consisting of four alleles, act in concert to produce five antigens and subsequent phenotypes. We were able to identify the marginal and novel interaction effects of these two variants on WBC. In the EA subjects, we identified significantly associated SNPs tagging three separate genes in the 17q21 region: (1) GSDMA, (2) MED24, and (3) PSMD3. Variants in this region have been reported to be associated with WBC, neutrophil count, and inflammatory diseases including asthma and Crohn's disease.	 21234875 20860503 12045153 12239261 175452 8624770 15542275 16415888 17073738 17110636 17611496 17194218 17701901 18179887 18587394 18500243 19083773 19165922 19180233 19200528 19198610 19732864 19820697 20139978 20182505 20371526 20172861 20040767 20372189 20811451 20718045 19430480 21269473

22010049	Loci affecting gamma-glutamyl transferase in adults and adolescents show age × SNP interaction and cardiometabolic disease associations.	Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity is a marker of liver disease which is also prospectively associated with the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancers. We have discovered novel loci affecting GGT in a genome-wide association study (rs1497406 in an intergenic region of chromosome 1, P = 3.9 × 10(-8); rs944002 in C14orf73 on chromosome 14, P = 4.7 × 10(-13); rs340005 in RORA on chromosome 15, P = 2.4 × 10(-8)), and a highly significant heterogeneity between adult and adolescent results at the GGT1 locus on chromosome 22 (maximum P(HET) = 5.6 × 10(-12) at rs6519520). Pathway analysis of significant and suggestive single-nucleotide polymorphism associations showed significant overlap between genes affecting GGT and those affecting common metabolic and inflammatory diseases, and identified the hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) family as controllers of a network of genes affecting GGT. Our results reinforce the disease associations of GGT and demonstrate that control by the GGT1 locus varies with age.	 16080113 9224128 16399403 17150307 17384006 17873877 17903117 17924335 17932318 18197199 18357469 20477721 20581827 20598278 20686565 20616382 21862451 18439552 18464913 18462017 18940312 18971639 19131466 19381306 19399611 19896111 20139978 11148181 11116135 11463151 11563810 12194918 14614204 14634009 15205466 8105165 8855394 16399400
22054870	A genome-wide scan for common variants affecting the rate of age-related cognitive decline.	Age-related cognitive decline is likely promoted by accumulated brain injury due to chronic conditions of aging, including neurodegenerative and vascular disease. Because common neuronal mechanisms may mediate the adaptation to diverse cerebral insults, we hypothesized that susceptibility for age-related cognitive decline may be due in part to a shared genetic network. We have therefore performed a genome-wide association study using a quantitative measure of global cognitive decline slope, based on repeated measures of 17 cognitive tests in 749 subjects from the Religious Orders Study. Top results were evaluated in 3 independent replication cohorts, consisting of 2279 additional subjects with repeated cognitive testing. As expected, we find that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus, APOE, is strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (P(DISC) = 5.6 × 10(-9); P(JOINT)= 3.7 × 10(-27)). We additionally discover a variant, rs10808746, which shows consistent effects in the replication cohorts and modestly improved evidence of association in the joint analysis (P(DISC) = 6.7 × 10(-5); P(REP) = 9.4 × 10(-3); P(JOINT) = 2.3 × 10(-5)). This variant influences the expression of 2 adjacent genes, PDE7A and MTFR1, which are potential regulators of inflammation and oxidative injury, respectively. Using aggregate measures of genetic risk, we find that known susceptibility loci for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory diseases are not significantly associated with cognitive decline in our cohort. Our results suggest that intermediate phenotypes, when coupled with larger sample sizes, may be a useful tool to dissect susceptibility loci for age-related cognitive decline and uncover shared molecular pathways with a role in neuronal injury.	 11882522 11904358 12061405 12117364 12136057 12438469 12480082 12580702 12895443 14646025 14662840 14694201 15148141 15272267 15380068 19906737 19919682 15389597 7168798 6610841 2310310 8431135 18974171 19195485 19467352 19525953 19734902 19734903 19808789 19782001 19840553 19737543 20336135 20460622 20558387 20562874 20616382 20577776 20844243 20876491 20799243 21029061 21280075 21304480 21391232 21460840 21460841 7987151 7475820 8669347 8687193 9171059 9230440 9708956 10404910 10522889 15297300 16107349 16209420 16103727 16801647 16862161 17035694 17362839 17463248 17701901 17709566 17873874 17943122 17879383 17579348 17982457 17568013 17466414 18496870 10673328 10720286 10755286 11213093 11304758 11375371
22055160	Abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with a variant in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1.	Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality and has a significant heritability. We carried out a genome-wide association discovery study of 1866 patients with AAA and 5435 controls and replication of promising signals (lead SNP with a p value < 1 × 10(-5)) in 2871 additional cases and 32,687 controls and performed further follow-up in 1491 AAA and 11,060 controls. In the discovery study, nine loci demonstrated association with AAA (p < 1 × 10(-5)). In the replication sample, the lead SNP at one of these loci, rs1466535, located within intron 1 of low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) demonstrated significant association (p = 0.0042). We confirmed the association of rs1466535 and AAA in our follow-up study (p = 0.035). In a combined analysis (6228 AAA and 49182 controls), rs1466535 had a consistent effect size and direction in all sample sets (combined p = 4.52 × 10(-10), odds ratio 1.15 [1.10-1.21]). No associations were seen for either rs1466535 or the 12q13.3 locus in independent association studies of coronary artery disease, blood pressure, diabetes, or hyperlipidaemia, suggesting that this locus is specific to AAA. Gene-expression studies demonstrated a trend toward increased LRP1 expression for the rs1466535 CC genotype in arterial tissues; there was a significant (p = 0.029) 1.19-fold (1.04-1.36) increase in LRP1 expression in CC homozygotes compared to TT homozygotes in aortic adventitia. Functional studies demonstrated that rs1466535 might alter a SREBP-1 binding site and influence enhancer activity at the locus. In conclusion, this study has identified a biologically plausible genetic variant associated specifically with AAA, and we suggest that this variant has a possible functional role in LRP1 expression.	 20628007 18176561 20980003 21307941 21378990 18372903 18974171 19028058 19343170 19742316 19592466 19913121 19903888 19939604 20173736 20130469 20622881 20686565 20562444 20811451 19430483 11279011 11373850 12690199 12960961 15461798 3761500 3503759 1985458 8049193 7956205 7615801 9072929 9501808 17701901 17846035 17994018 17920311 21058334

22057235	Dense genotyping identifies and localizes multiple common and rare variant association signals in celiac disease.	Using variants from the 1000 Genomes Project pilot European CEU dataset and data from additional resequencing studies, we densely genotyped 183 non-HLA risk loci previously associated with immune-mediated diseases in 12,041 individuals with celiac disease (cases) and 12,228 controls. We identified 13 new celiac disease risk loci reaching genome-wide significance, bringing the number of known loci (including the HLA locus) to 40. We found multiple independent association signals at over one-third of these loci, a finding that is attributable to a combination of common, low-frequency and rare genetic variants. Compared to previously available data such as those from HapMap3, our dense genotyping in a large sample collection provided a higher resolution of the pattern of linkage disequilibrium and suggested localization of many signals to finer scale regions. In particular, 29 of the 54 fine-mapped signals seemed to be localized to single genes and, in some instances, to gene regulatory elements. Altogether, we define the complex genetic architecture of the risk regions of and refine the risk signals for celiac disease, providing the next step toward uncovering the causal mechanisms of the disease.	 10866211 19027045 11875755 12801951 14764493 2205160 15925839 16228001 17554300 17558408 17701901 17676041 19240061 20126254 20190752 20560212 20657596 20686566 20647424 20634204 20881960 20981092 21047260 21057501 21194676 21336280 21383967 21437273 21378987 21364697 21490378 21775993 21345260 17909891 18311140 18487275 19079049 19092835 19073967 18805825

22065538	CDH13 gene coding T-cadherin influences variations in plasma adiponectin levels in the Japanese population.	Adiponectin is most abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and well known to play an important role in metabolic regulation. Several studies have attempted to identify the genetic determinants of metabolic syndrome (MetS), though no study has revealed a cis- or trans-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that affects plasma adiponectin levels, except the adiponectin structure gene and genes encoding adiponectin-regulatory proteins. We performed a genome-wide association study in regards to plasma adiponectin concentrations in 3,310 Japanese subjects. We identified the strongest statistically associated SNP (rs4783244) with adiponectin levels (P = 3.8 × 10(-19)) in the first intron of CDH13 (T-cadherin) gene in a 30-kb haplotype block covering the promoter region to first intron. In addition, rs12051272 SNP genotypes in linkage disequilibrium with rs4783244 were found to be more significantly associated with adiponectin levels (P = 9.5×10(-20)) and specifically with the levels of high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, a subtype form associated with parameters related to glucose metabolism. Our results did show more significant association with adiponectin levels than rs12444338 (in CDH13) SNP genotypes reported recently. We suggest that the phenotype-affecting haplotype tagged by rs12051272 SNP would affect the plasma adiponectin levels and that we have to take the CDH13 genotype into account before considering the functional relevance of the adiponectin level.

22080838	A genome-wide association study of COPD identifies a susceptibility locus on chromosome 19q13.	The genetic risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still largely unknown. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of limited size have identified several novel risk loci for COPD at CHRNA3/CHRNA5/IREB2, HHIP and FAM13A; additional loci may be identified through larger studies. We performed a GWAS using a total of 3499 cases and 1922 control subjects from four cohorts: the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE); the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT); Bergen, Norway (GenKOLS); and the COPDGene study. Genotyping was performed on Illumina platforms with additional markers imputed using 1000 Genomes data; results were summarized using fixed-effect meta-analysis. We identified a new genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 19q13 (rs7937, OR = 0.74, P = 2.9 × 10(-9)). Genotyping this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and another nearby SNP in linkage disequilibrium (rs2604894) in 2859 subjects from the family-based International COPD Genetics Network study (ICGN) demonstrated supportive evidence for association for COPD (P = 0.28 and 0.11 for rs7937 and rs2604894), pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) (P = 0.08 and 0.04) and severe (GOLD 3&4) COPD (P = 0.09 and 0.017). This region includes RAB4B, EGLN2, MIA and CYP2A6, and has previously been identified in association with cigarette smoking behavior.	 20418890 11315092 18974171 17071833 17194218 7966841 16862161 8565161 21597399 16456143 14740322 17384015 17189520 21374718 20700436 21320324 17943122 19836010 842934 17291167 10999944 15734728 9620904 17446335 19996190 21565292 20418888 20564069 17765523 20581827 25073655 12208849 18978134 20616382 19010884 18565956 21378990 20010834 10225243 15710956 21119205 18952566 18852200 15817713 8801636 19342411 11704589 16081882 21304900 19365400 19300482 12719384 21058334 21862624 5844558 21685187 20007924 12759479 19800047 20634204 16895437 17701901 21495840 18342301 17507545 15502828 20173748 9426791 20981092 20010835 11784461 11912177 10093988 19571811 19933216 20565482 18360915 20214461 19300500 18216052 8627511
22076464	Identification of germline susceptibility loci in ETV6-RUNX1-rearranged childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease of the white blood cells. The etiology of ALL is believed to be multifactorial and likely to involve an interplay of environmental and genetic variables. We performed a genome-wide association study of 355 750 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 474 controls and 419 childhood ALL cases characterized by a t(12;21)(p13;q22) - the most common chromosomal translocation observed in childhood ALL - which leads to an ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The eight most strongly associated SNPs were followed-up in 951 ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases and 3061 controls from Germany/Austria and Italy, respectively. We identified a novel, genome-wide significant risk locus at 3q28 (TP63, rs17505102, P(CMH)=8.94 × 10(-9), OR=0.65). The separate analysis of the combined German/Austrian sample only, revealed additional genome-wide significant associations at 11q11 (OR8U8, rs1945213, P=9.14 × 10(-11), OR=0.69) and 8p21.3 (near INTS10, rs920590, P=6.12 × 10(-9), OR=1.36). These associations and another association at 11p11.2 (PTPRJ, rs3942852, P=4.95 × 10(-7), OR=0.72) remained significant in the German/Austrian replication panel after correction for multiple testing. Our findings demonstrate that germline genetic variation can specifically contribute to the risk of ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood ALL. The identification of TP63 and PTPRJ as susceptibility genes emphasize the role of the TP53 gene family and the importance of proteins regulating cellular processes in connection with tumorigenesis.	 15378013 10485447 15837625 16000320 16407512 16490960 17366834 17482546 17701901 17873874 17846227 18074355 18249142 18072274 19100368 19200528 18783329 19570515 19242497 19684603 19684604 20008176 19672627 20042726 20357260 20348956 20379196 20223594 21167019 10535733 11125122 11681414 11839669 12089527 12776199 9531590 10227293 10227294 10391684 15698386
22081228	Genome-wide association study identifies FCGR2A as a susceptibility locus for Kawasaki disease.	Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology, with clinical observations suggesting a substantial genetic contribution to disease susceptibility. We conducted a genome-wide association study and replication analysis in 2,173 individuals with Kawasaki disease and 9,383 controls from five independent sample collections. Two loci exceeded the formal threshold for genome-wide significance. The first locus is a functional polymorphism in the IgG receptor gene FCGR2A (encoding an H131R substitution) (rs1801274; P = 7.35 × 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 1.32), with the A allele (coding for histadine) conferring elevated disease risk. The second locus is at 19q13, (P = 2.51 × 10(-9), OR = 1.42 for the rs2233152 SNP near MIA and RAB4B; P = 1.68 × 10(-12), OR = 1.52 for rs28493229 in ITPKC), which confirms previous findings(1). The involvement of the FCGR2A locus may have implications for understanding immune activation in Kawasaki disease pathogenesis and the mechanism of response to intravenous immunoglobulin, the only proven therapy for this disease.	 16282773 21326860 21131975 19465909 17352422 20062062 16862161 11313775 12824229 18084290 19190534 11547745 18571548 12499305 20827277 19525955 16254553 17827395 19018092 19330030 15302199 1776877 12154377 19132087 15297300 20228799 9444428 16534213 1709446 19915573 19309690 18930989 17554300 21399633 17701901 10973253 18204446 18364728 15505111 17160344 21221998 11055368 20423928 16423595 21060863 18672254
22086417	A genome-wide meta-analysis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma identifies risk loci at 6p21.32.	Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (NSHL) is a distinct, highly heritable Hodgkin lymphoma subtype. We undertook a genome-wide meta-analysis of 393 European-origin adolescent/young adult NSHL patients and 3315 controls using the Illumina Human610-Quad Beadchip and Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. We identified 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 6p21.32 that were significantly associated with NSHL risk: rs9268542 (P = 5.35 × 10(-10)), rs204999 (P = 1.44 × 10(-9)), and rs2858870 (P = 1.69 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed a previously reported association in the same region, rs6903608 (P = 3.52 × 10(-10)). rs204999 and rs2858870 were weakly correlated (r(2) = 0.257), and the remaining pairs of SNPs were not correlated (r(2) < 0.1). In an independent set of 113 NSHL cases and 214 controls, 2 SNPs were significantly associated with NSHL and a third showed a comparable odds ratio (OR). These SNPs are found on 2 haplotypes associated with NSHL risk (rs204999-rs9268528-rs9268542-rs6903608-rs2858870; AGGCT, OR = 1.7, P = 1.71 × 10(-6); GAATC, OR = 0.4, P = 1.16 × 10(-4)). All individuals with the GAATC haplotype also carried the HLA class II DRB1*0701 allele. In a separate analysis, the DRB1*0701 allele was associated with a decreased risk of NSHL (OR = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.4, 0.7). These data support the importance of the HLA class II region in NSHL etiology.	 10553908 21921049 11315092 11665304 11781255 12036854 12078899 14523140 15070705 15202522 15252420 1303125 8116619 7824015 15686457 15712014 16557259 16862161 16998491 16971956 17234427 17529973 17728769 17898773 18077789 18397187 18646185 19364948 19525189 19706467 19773754 19738032 19745833 19804451 20639881 21037568 21439368 10808239
22833209	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple novel loci associated with disease progression in subjects with mild cognitive impairment.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly population; however, knowledge about genetic risk factors involved in disease progression is limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using clinical decline as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes as a quantitative trait to test for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with the rate of progression in 822 Caucasian subjects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There was no significant association with disease progress for any of the recently identified disease susceptibility variants in CLU, CR1, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A6A, MS4A4E or CD33 following multiple testing correction. We did, however, identify multiple novel loci that reached genome-wide significance at the 0.01 level. These top variants (rs7840202 at chr8 in UBR5: P=4.27 × 10(-14); rs11637611 with a cluster of SNPs at chr15q23 close to the Tay-Sachs disease locus: P=1.07 × 10(-15); and rs12752888 at chr1: P=3.08 × 10(-11)) were also associated with a significant decline in cognition as well as the conversion of subjects with MCI to a diagnosis of AD. Taken together, these variants define approximately 16.6% of the MCI sub-population with a faster rate of decline independent of the other known disease risk factors. In addition to providing new insights into protein pathways that may be involved with the progress to AD in MCI subjects, these variants if further validated may enable the identification of a more homogeneous population of subjects at an earlier stage of disease for testing novel hypotheses and/or therapies in the clinical setting.	 14505582 21514249 7646655 9343467 15829527 16461860 17077275 17317784 17474819 17553421 17701901 17998437 18394988 18695059 18976728 19136949 19296504 19668339 19734902 19734903 20061642 20451875 20460622 20862329 20029386 20604708 21123754 21390209 21460840 21460841 15324362
22095909	Serum ferritin levels are associated with a distinct phenotype of chronic hepatitis C poorly responding to pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy.	Elevated serum ferritin levels may reflect a systemic inflammatory state as well as increased iron storage, both of which may contribute to an unfavorable outcome of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of serum ferritin and its genetic determinants in the pathogenesis and treatment of CHC. To this end, serum ferritin levels at baseline of therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin or before biopsy were correlated with clinical and histological features of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, including necroinflammatory activity (N = 970), fibrosis (N = 980), steatosis (N = 886), and response to treatment (N = 876). The association between high serum ferritin levels (> median) and the endpoints was assessed by logistic regression. Moreover, a candidate gene as well as a genome-wide association study of serum ferritin were performed. We found that serum ferritin ≥ the sex-specific median was one of the strongest pretreatment predictors of treatment failure (univariate P < 0.0001, odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.34-0.60). This association remained highly significant in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.0002, OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.20-0.61), with an OR comparable to that of interleukin (IL)28B genotype. When patients with the unfavorable IL28B genotypes were stratified according to high versus low ferritin levels, SVR rates differed by > 30% in both HCV genotype 1- and genotype 3-infected patients (P < 0.001). Serum ferritin levels were also independently associated with severe liver fibrosis (P < 0.0001, OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.68-4.25) and steatosis (P = 0.002, OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.35-3.91), but not with necroinflammatory activity (P = 0.3). Genetic variations had only a limited impact on serum ferritin levels.	
22085899	UGT1A1 is a major locus influencing bilirubin levels in African Americans.	Total serum bilirubin is associated with several clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and drug metabolism. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 619 healthy unrelated African Americans in an attempt to replicate reported findings in Europeans and Asians and to identify novel loci influencing total serum bilirubin levels. We analyzed a dense panel of over two million genotyped and imputed SNPs in additive genetic models adjusting for age, sex, and the first two significant principal components from the sample covariance matrix of genotypes. Thirty-nine SNPs spanning a 78 kb region within the UGT1A1 displayed P-values <5 × 10(-8). The lowest P-value was 1.7 × 10(-22) for SNP rs887829. None of SNPs in the UGT1A1 remained statistically significant in conditional association analyses that adjusted for rs887829. In addition, SNP rs10929302 located in phenobarbital response enhancer module was significantly associated with bilirubin level with a P-value of 1.37 × 10(-11); this enhancer module is believed to have a critical role in phenobarbital treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. Interestingly, the lead SNP, rs887829, is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2)≥0.74) with rs10929302. Taking advantage of the lower LD and shorter haplotypes in African-ancestry populations, we identified rs887829 as a more refined proxy for the causative variant influencing bilirubin levels. Also, we replicated the reported association between variants in SEMA3C and bilirubin levels. In summary, UGT1A1 is a major locus influencing bilirubin levels and the results of this study promise to contribute to understanding of the etiology and treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia in African-ancestry populations.	 17701901 17606575 19349540 19414484 19419973 19609347 19712005 19389676 20027299 20495302 20649705 20639394 20693308 21042596 21080475 21309756 21325185 21294900 21188353 11257278 11315092 11867360 12173031 15382174 5925902 1898728 1526025 8467709 8287538 7586525 9545414 9653159 16862161 18776908

22116939	Two-stage genome-wide association study identifies variants in CAMSAP1L1 as susceptibility loci for epilepsy in Chinese.	In the majority of patients, epilepsy is a complex disorder with multiple susceptibility genes interacting with environmental factors. However, we understand little about its genetic risks. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify common susceptibility variants of epilepsy in Chinese. This two-stage GWAS included a total of 1087 patients and 3444 matched controls. In the combined analysis of the two stages, the strongest signals were observed with two highly correlated variants, rs2292096 [G] [P= 1.0 × 10(-8), odds ratio (OR) = 0.63] and rs6660197 [T] (P= 9.9 × 10(-7), OR = 0.69), with the former reaching genome-wide significance, on 1q32.1 in the CAMSAP1L1 gene, which encodes a cytoskeletal protein. We also refined a previously reported association with rs9390754 (P= 1.7 × 10(-5)) on 6q21 in the GRIK2 gene, which encodes a glutamate receptor, and identified several other loci in genes involved in neurotransmission or neuronal networking that warrant further investigation. Our results suggest that common genetic variants may increase the susceptibility to epilepsy in Chinese.	
22116950	Genetic variants and environmental factors associated with hormonal markers of ovarian reserve in Caucasian and African American women.	The ovarian reserve (number and quality of oocytes) is correlated with reproductive potential as well as somatic health, and is likely to have multiple genetic and environmental determinants. Several reproductive hormones are closely linked with the oocyte pool and thus can serve as surrogate markers of ovarian reserve. However, we know little about the underlying genes or genetic variants.	 9590601 9207591 10192308 14798839 15545787 15297300 15769979 16126408 16113044 16255080 16244653 16685642 16758348 17261576 17326099 17636279 18192670 18192675 18583979 18776909 18291376 19471299 19768530 17852428 19840990 19752762 20562217 20634204 20734064 20149366 21396948 10535795 11323317 11527915 12021167 12416998 74610 6859020 6480814 3935248 3421245 8154718 7968648 7670487 9006309 9626112

22137330	Genome-wide study links MTMR7 gene to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob risk.	The aim of our study was to discover genomic variations related to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) susceptibility. A genome-wide association analysis with most vCJD samples available in the world was performed. A series of 93 vCJD UK patients and 1504 UK controls were included in the discovery stage. Our best findings were replicated in an independent population of 22 UK and 20 French vCJD cases. Post hoc analysis to assess our main results included 5711 French controls, 445 Dutch controls, and 446 sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases. We found 2 genome wide significant variants tagging PRNP: rs6107516 (p = 2.6 × 10(-18)) and rs2065706 (p = 8.8 × 10(-14)). Two other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs4921542 and rs7565981) were successfully replicated in independent samples and reached genome-wide significance after pooling discovery and replication populations. Rs4921542 (p = 1.6 × 10(-8)) is an intronic variant in the myotubularin related protein 7 gene (MTMR7), which is specifically expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and inositol 1,3-bisphosphate. Rs7565981 (p = 4.2 × 10(-8)) is in an intergenic region upstream of the neuronal PAS (per-ARNT-sim) domain-containing protein 2 gene (NPAS2), a regulatory gene belonging to a family of transcription factors that has been implicated in memory, seasonal affective disorder, and the molecular clock in the mammalian forebrain. A proxy of rs7565981 (rs17024792; r(2) = 1.0) has been found to regulate the phospholipase C-delta-3 gene (PLCD3) in trans. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Our study reveals 2 new genome-wide significant markers for vCJD outside PRNP and provides evidence supporting a role of the phosphatidylinositol pathway in vCJD susceptibility.	
22139419	New gene functions in megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation.	Platelets are the second most abundant cell type in blood and are essential for maintaining haemostasis. Their count and volume are tightly controlled within narrow physiological ranges, but there is only limited understanding of the molecular processes controlling both traits. Here we carried out a high-powered meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in up to 66,867 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment. We identified 68 genomic loci reliably associated with platelet count and volume mapping to established and putative novel regulators of megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation. These genes show megakaryocyte-specific gene expression patterns and extensive network connectivity. Using gene silencing in Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster, we identified 11 of the genes as novel regulators of blood cell formation. Taken together, our findings advance understanding of novel gene functions controlling fate-determining events during megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation, providing a new example of successful translation of GWAS to function.	 19110211 19221038 19228925 19812666 19820697 19691485 20139978 20065294 20562874 20686565 20881960 20942852 21153663 21738486 21715309 11315092 11404479 8202160 8735807 16251900 17394559 17934486 17943122 17947979 18539114
22144915	Genome-wide meta-analysis of five Asian cohorts identifies PDGFRA as a susceptibility locus for corneal astigmatism.	Corneal astigmatism refers to refractive abnormalities and irregularities in the curvature of the cornea, and this interferes with light being accurately focused at a single point in the eye. This ametropic condition is highly prevalent, influences visual acuity, and is a highly heritable trait. There is currently a paucity of research in the genetic etiology of corneal astigmatism. Here we report the results from five genome-wide association studies of corneal astigmatism across three Asian populations, with an initial discovery set of 4,254 Chinese and Malay individuals consisting of 2,249 cases and 2,005 controls. Replication was obtained from three surveys comprising of 2,139 Indians, an additional 929 Chinese children, and an independent 397 Chinese family trios. Variants in PDGFRA on chromosome 4q12 (lead SNP: rs7677751, allelic odds ratio = 1.26 (95% CI: 1.16-1.36), P(meta) = 7.87×10(-9)) were identified to be significantly associated with corneal astigmatism, exhibiting consistent effect sizes across all five cohorts. This highlights the potential role of variants in PDGFRA in the genetic etiology of corneal astigmatism across diverse Asian populations.	 9718344 15829852 10366072 18523665 18466501 16862161 17721286 20835239 14740322 20869774 15829845 19700652 19430327 15557431 8927316 21665993 19933197 8037216 17177660 17365815 12522257 9423903 19344713 17210850 20351602 16283989 21205266 21307088 21372019 18293391 21095009 7223852 14507908 18695106 19032953 19420339 19815729 15557849 14985292 18852200 19995197 9328546 21098505 17898312 8449682 11328732 9503439 8814146 16638989 15307048 10333940 16877283 20835236 17197519 8586421 2348145 15134476 12322931 15845037 10937558 8088954 17184807 18385047 1607244 17385291 8982160 10359318 11693972

22138694	A genome-wide association study in Han Chinese identifies new susceptibility loci for ankylosing spondylitis.	To identify susceptibility loci for ankylosing spondylitis, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study in Han Chinese. In the discovery stage, we analyzed 1,356,350 autosomal SNPs in 1,837 individuals with ankylosing spondylitis and 4,231 controls; in the validation stage, we analyzed 30 suggestive SNPs in an additional 2,100 affected individuals and 3,496 controls. We identified two new susceptibility loci between EDIL3 and HAPLN1 at 5q14.3 (rs4552569; P = 8.77 × 10(-10)) and within ANO6 at 12q12 (rs17095830; P = 1.63 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed previously reported associations in Europeans within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (top SNP, rs13202464; P < 5 × 10(-324)) and at 2p15 (rs10865331; P = 1.98 × 10(-8)). We show that rs13202464 within the MHC region mainly represents the risk effect of HLA-B*27 variants (including HLA-B*2704, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-B*2715) in Chinese. The two newly discovered loci implicate genes related to bone formation and cartilage development, suggesting their potential involvement in the etiology of ankylosing spondylitis.	 19804562 20062062 16862161 18391951 21068102 20929859 19536542 17908086 20823067 20190199 18606306 19169255 20953637 17082617 17016480 9062966 18821688 17350674 20512145 16677075 18311819 21107324 19304568 10203021 21743469 15456769 19877036 9433870 17701901 17448825 21152001 20652271 21490949 19015192 17952073 19543373 17935617 9988279 19733078

22158537	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies eight new loci for type 2 diabetes in east Asians.	We conducted a three-stage genetic study to identify susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in east Asian populations. We followed our stage 1 meta-analysis of eight T2D genome-wide association studies (6,952 cases with T2D and 11,865 controls) with a stage 2 in silico replication analysis (5,843 cases and 4,574 controls) and a stage 3 de novo replication analysis (12,284 cases and 13,172 controls). The combined analysis identified eight new T2D loci reaching genome-wide significance, which mapped in or near GLIS3, PEPD, FITM2-R3HDML-HNF4A, KCNK16, MAEA, GCC1-PAX4, PSMD6 and ZFAND3. GLIS3, which is involved in pancreatic beta cell development and insulin gene expression, is known for its association with fasting glucose levels. The evidence of an association with T2D for PEPD and HNF4A has been shown in previous studies. KCNK16 may regulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the pancreas. These findings, derived from an east Asian population, provide new perspectives on the etiology of T2D.	 20818381 21263211 21304890 21515849 11263999 11742409 11855950 15047633 9029679 15654769 15955370 16075046 16707498 17323924 17434869 17463248 17827402 18160536 18728231 18952314 18711367 18711366 19264802 19557189 19401414 19734900 19812666 19805515 20081858 20174558 20501604 20581827 20075855 19430480 20862305
22158540	Genome-wide association study identifies five loci associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in Chinese populations.	Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate among human cancers, and there are no effective markers for its screening and early diagnosis. To identify genetic susceptibility markers for this cancer, we carried out a genome-wide association study on 981 individuals with pancreatic cancer (cases) and 1,991 cancer-free controls of Chinese descent using 666,141 autosomal SNPs. Promising associations were replicated in an additional 2,603 pancreatic cancer cases and 2,877 controls recruited from 25 hospitals in 16 provinces or cities in China. We identified five new susceptibility loci at chromosomes 21q21.3, 5p13.1, 21q22.3, 22q13.32 and 10q26.11 (P = 2.24 × 10(-13) to P = 4.18 × 10(-10)) in addition to 13q22.1 previously reported in populations of European ancestry. These results advance our understanding of the development of pancreatic cancer and highlight potential targets for the prevention or treatment of this cancer.	 20833034 11561603 20388958 20592473 17873877 18550526 20101243 20686608 19422084 17498513 10759231 18725219 19282658 17904108 20473916 17982507 11406647 21306478 19064997 20383573 20154680 15051286 12356737 19276450 15177885 14742914 15734730 11731797 18483392 19648918 10340382 11389052 17907809 19549972 17924335 20518085 20593496 12377812 20103627 15945096 16816378 11359772 19581931

22174390	Heritability of submaximal exercise heart rate response to exercise training is accounted for by nine SNPs.	Endurance training-induced changes in hemodynamic traits are heritable. However, few genes associated with heart rate training responses have been identified. The purpose of our study was to perform a genome-wide association study to uncover DNA sequence variants associated with submaximal exercise heart rate training responses in the HERITAGE Family Study. Heart rate was measured during steady-state exercise at 50 W (HR50) on 2 separate days before and after a 20-wk endurance training program in 483 white subjects from 99 families. Illumina HumanCNV370-Quad v3.0 BeadChips were genotyped using the Illumina BeadStation 500GX platform. After quality control procedures, 320,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available for the genome-wide association study analyses, which were performed using the MERLIN software package (single-SNP analyses and conditional heritability tests) and standard regression models (multivariate analyses). The strongest associations for HR50 training response adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and baseline HR50 were detected with SNPs at the YWHAQ locus on chromosome 2p25 (P = 8.1 × 10(-7)), the RBPMS locus on chromosome 8p12 (P = 3.8 × 10(-6)), and the CREB1 locus on chromosome 2q34 (P = 1.6 × 10(-5)). In addition, 37 other SNPs showed P values <9.9 × 10(-5). After removal of redundant SNPs, the 10 most significant SNPs explained 35.9% of the ΔHR50 variance in a multivariate regression model. Conditional heritability tests showed that nine of these SNPs (all intragenic) accounted for 100% of the ΔHR50 heritability. Our results indicate that SNPs in nine genes related to cardiomyocyte and neuronal functions, as well as cardiac memory formation, fully account for the heritability of the submaximal heart rate training response.	 8336698 1420083 9502355 10051327 15687283 16360096 16284076 16713569 16728661 16679322 16923798 16914520 17145769 17040971 17565597 17921336 19520913 19566901 20407090 20187889 20798500 20864672 10647543 10836149 11080204 11154219 11194095 11162443 11467950 11731797 11953308 12582953 12968206 14593000 15488195 6484569 7674877
22170493	Genome-wide meta-analysis of psoriatic arthritis identifies susceptibility locus at REL.	Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disease affecting up to 30% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) cases and approximately 0.25 to 1% of the general population. To identify common susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of three imputed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on psoriasis, stratified for PsA. A total of 1,160,703 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in the discovery set consisting of 535 PsA cases and 3,432 controls from Germany, the United States, and Canada. We followed up two SNPs in 1,931 PsA cases and 6,785 controls comprising six independent replication panels from Germany, Estonia, the United States, and Canada. In the combined analysis, a genome-wide significant association was detected at 2p16 near the REL locus encoding c-Rel (rs13017599, P=1.18 × 10(-8), odds ratio (OR)=1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-1.35). The rs13017599 polymorphism is known to associate with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and another SNP near REL (rs702873) was recently implicated in PsV susceptibility. However, conditional analysis indicated that rs13017599, rather than rs702873, accounts for the PsA association at REL. We hypothesize that c-Rel, as a member of the Rel/NF-κB family, is associated with PsA in the context of disease pathways that involve other identified PsA and PsV susceptibility genes including TNIP1, TNFAIP3, and NFκBIA.	 12894126 12941544 4581554 8304761 9735374 15708927 15757963 16032514 16490960 16871531 17513759 17658397 17701901 17982049 18369459 19169254 19200528 18524791 19503088 20084005 20190752 20208533 20228799 20415816 20616382 20811451 20875338 20953186 20953188 20953189 20953190 20981092 21102463 21469108 21425313 21613309 21654831
21908519	Polymorphisms in B3GAT1, SLC9A9 and MGAT5 are associated with variation within the human plasma N-glycome of 3533 European adults.	The majority of human proteins are post-translationally modified by covalent addition of one or more complex oligosaccharides (glycans). Alterations in glycosylation processing are associated with numerous diseases and glycans are attracting increasing attention both as disease biomarkers and as targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Using a recently developed high-throughput high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis method, we have reported, in a pilot genome-wide association study of 13 glycan features in 2705 individuals from three European populations, that polymorphisms at three loci (FUT8, FUT6/FUT3 and HNF1A) affect plasma levels of N-glycans. Here, we extended the analysis to 33 directly measured and 13 derived glycosylation traits in 3533 individuals and identified three novel gene association (MGAT5, B3GAT1 and SLC9A9) as well as replicated the previous findings using an additional European cohort. MGAT5 (meta-analysis association P-value = 1.80 × 10(-10) for rs1257220) encodes a glycosyltransferase which is known to synthesize the associated glycans. In contrast, neither B3GAT1 (rs7928758, P = 1.66 × 10(-08)) nor SLC9A9 (rs4839604, P = 3.50 × 10(-13)) had previously been associated functionally with glycosylation of plasma proteins. Given the glucuronyl transferase activity of B3GAT1, we were able to show that glucuronic acid is present on antennae of plasma glycoproteins underlying the corresponding HPLC peak. SLC9A9 encodes a proton pump which affects pH in the endosomal compartment and it was recently reported that changes in Golgi pH can impair protein sialylation, giving a possible mechanism for the observed association.	
22180457	A genome-wide association study identifies locus at 10q22 associated with clinical outcomes of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer patients in Japanese.	Although many association studies of polymorphisms in candidate genes with the clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy have been reported, genetic factors determining individual response to tamoxifen are not fully understood. To identify genetic polymorphisms associated with clinical outcomes of patients with tamoxifen treatment, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We studied 462 Japanese patients with hormone receptor-positive, invasive breast cancer receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Of them, 240 patients were analyzed by genome-wide genotyping using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChips, and two independent sets of 105 and 117 cases were used for replication studies. In the GWAS, we detected significant associations with recurrence-free survival at 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on nine chromosomal loci (1p31, 1q41, 5q33, 7p11, 10q22, 12q13, 13q22, 18q12 and 19p13) that satisfied a genome-wide significant threshold (log-rank P= 2.87 × 10(-9)-9.41 × 10(-8)). Among them, rs10509373 in C10orf11 gene on 10q22 was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in the replication study (log-rank P= 2.02 × 10(-4)) and a combined analysis indicated a strong association of this SNP with recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen (log-rank P= 1.26 × 10(-10)). Hazard ratio per C allele of rs10509373 was 4.51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-7.51; P= 6.29 × 10(-9)]. In a combined analysis of rs10509373 genotype with previously identified genetic makers, CYP2D6 and ABCC2, the number of risk alleles of these three genes had cumulative effects on recurrence-free survival among 345 patients receiving tamoxifen monotherapy (log-rank P= 2.28 × 10(-12)). In conclusion, we identified a novel locus associated with recurrence-free survival in Japanese breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.

22182935	Genome-wide association study meta-analysis of European and Asian-ancestry samples identifies three novel loci associated with bipolar disorder.	Meta-analyses of bipolar disorder (BD) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genome-wide significant signals in European-ancestry samples, but so far account for little of the inherited risk. We performed a meta-analysis of ∼750,000 high-quality genetic markers on a combined sample of ∼14,000 subjects of European and Asian-ancestry (phase I). The most significant findings were further tested in an extended sample of ∼17,700 cases and controls (phase II). The results suggest novel association findings near the genes TRANK1 (LBA1), LMAN2L and PTGFR. In phase I, the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9834970 near TRANK1, was significant at the P=2.4 × 10(-11) level, with no heterogeneity. Supportive evidence for prior association findings near ANK3 and a locus on chromosome 3p21.1 was also observed. The phase II results were similar, although the heterogeneity test became significant for several SNPs. On the basis of these results and other established risk loci, we used the method developed by Park et al. to estimate the number, and the effect size distribution, of BD risk loci that could still be found by GWAS methods. We estimate that >63,000 case-control samples would be needed to identify the ∼105 BD risk loci discoverable by GWAS, and that these will together explain <6% of the inherited risk. These results support previous GWAS findings and identify three new candidate genes for BD. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and may potentially lead to identification of functional variants. Sample size will remain a limiting factor in the discovery of common alleles associated with BD.

22197929	A genome-wide association study in Han Chinese identifies multiple susceptibility loci for IgA nephropathy.	We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Han Chinese, with 1,434 affected individuals (cases) and 4,270 controls in the discovery phase and follow-up of the top 61 SNPs in an additional 2,703 cases and 3,464 controls. We identified associations at 17p13 (rs3803800, P = 9.40 × 10(-11), OR = 1.21; rs4227, P = 4.31 × 10(-10), OR = 1.23) and 8p23 (rs2738048, P = 3.18 × 10(-14), OR = 0.79) that implicated the genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNFSF13) and α-defensin (DEFA) as susceptibility genes. In addition, we found multiple associations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (rs660895, P = 4.13 × 10(-20), OR = 1.34; rs1794275, P = 3.43 × 10(-13), OR = 1.30; rs2523946, P = 1.74 × 10(-11), OR = 1.21) and confirmed a previously reported association at 22q12 (rs12537, P = 1.17 × 10(-11), OR = 0.78). We also found that rs660895 was associated with clinical subtypes of IgAN (P = 0.003), proteinuria (P = 0.025) and IgA levels (P = 0.047). Our findings show that IgAN is associated with variants near genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation.	 21188648 10792601 9544580 16862161 7638860 19591572 19674163 20724351 17908271 12070306 17525715 19812988 20890272 17900288 8604700 643002 17572673 19143943 12949495 21051598 8821832 15297300 15930092 15571177 16998491 16485042 16528253 3264381 17924348 21399633 3329736 17186473 17701901 17634434 19288169 11062479 17570691 20981092 18222346 3055955 18003664 14988498 20386929 19543373 12768083 14685227 18367833 12213946 16208405 19024344
22197933	A genome-wide association study in Chinese men identifies three risk loci for non-obstructive azoospermia.	Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is one of the most severe forms of male infertility. Its pathophysiology is largely unknown, and few genetic influences have been defined. To identify common variants contributing to NOA in Han Chinese men, we performed a three-stage genome-wide association study of 2,927 individuals with NOA and 5,734 controls. The combined analyses identified significant (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) associations between NOA risk and common variants near PRMT6 (rs12097821 at 1p13.3: odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, P = 5.7 × 10(-10)), PEX10 (rs2477686 at 1p36.32: OR = 1.39, P = 5.7 × 10(-12)) and SOX5 (rs10842262 at 12p12.1: OR = 1.23, P = 2.3 × 10(-9)). These findings implicate genetic variants at 1p13.3, 1p36.32 and 12p12.1 in the etiology of NOA in Han Chinese men.	 12475944 12394759 21131975 15121861 17873877 11912161 16862161 19088127 14500443 17982459 19578939 7989450 18342849 11756355 8812465 12099633 17579990 17164419 18462017 16753561 20502693 15297300 16699504 20378615 20103481 20887963 19644074 17982457 8538772 16600869 11292851 18266473 20220758 17701901 21725308 18989307 17873874 17204527 9037052 18846210 1396566 19933170 10664067 19478329 20220756
22197932	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies three new risk loci for atopic dermatitis.	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a commonly occurring chronic skin disease with high heritability. Apart from filaggrin (FLG), the genes influencing atopic dermatitis are largely unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 5,606 affected individuals and 20,565 controls from 16 population-based cohorts and then examined the ten most strongly associated new susceptibility loci in an additional 5,419 affected individuals and 19,833 controls from 14 studies. Three SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the discovery and replication cohorts combined, including rs479844 upstream of OVOL1 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.88, P = 1.1 × 10(-13)) and rs2164983 near ACTL9 (OR = 1.16, P = 7.1 × 10(-9)), both of which are near genes that have been implicated in epidermal proliferation and differentiation, as well as rs2897442 in KIF3A within the cytokine cluster at 5q31.1 (OR = 1.11, P = 3.8 × 10(-8)). We also replicated association with the FLG locus and with two recently identified association signals at 11q13.5 (rs7927894; P = 0.008) and 20q13.33 (rs6010620; P = 0.002). Our results underline the importance of both epidermal barrier function and immune dysregulation in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.	 18614543 18301422 16862161 15549674 19399181 16490960 19734141 19209157 12700767 19169254 12517699 19305417 16160692 15716349 16032513 12600310 18846228 20395968 9808631 16636146 19501237 16815134 18385500 15121845 20860503 18075513 18337711 15554875 21666691 16550169 21304890 17554300 19279724 18938133 17701901 21289094 19349984 11983900
22216198	A genome-wide association study of the Protein C anticoagulant pathway.	The Protein C anticoagulant pathway regulates blood coagulation by preventing the inadequate formation of thrombi. It has two main plasma components: protein C and protein S. Individuals with protein C or protein S deficiency present a dramatically increased incidence of thromboembolic disorders. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for protein C and protein S plasma levels in a set of extended pedigrees from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) Project. A total number of 397 individuals from 21 families were typed for 307,984 SNPs using the Infinium® 317 k Beadchip (Illumina). Protein C and protein S (free, functional and total) plasma levels were determined with biochemical assays for all participants. Association with phenotypes was investigated through variance component analysis. After correcting for multiple testing, two SNPs for protein C plasma levels (rs867186 and rs8119351) and another two for free protein S plasma levels (rs1413885 and rs1570868) remained significant on a genome-wide level, located in and around the PROCR and the DNAJC6 genomic regions respectively. No SNPs were significantly associated with functional or total protein S plasma levels, although rs1413885 from DNAJC6 showed suggestive association with the functional protein S phenotype, possibly indicating that this locus plays an important role in protein S metabolism. Our results provide evidence that PROCR and DNAJC6 might play a role in protein C and free protein S plasma levels in the population studied, warranting further investigation on the role of these loci in the etiology of venous thromboembolism and other thrombotic diseases.	 11037320 10747348 11702218 11731797 12615682 12871272 15142863 15178554 15304035 6457049 2949697 3435047 7803790 7749828 7482420 8816778 8950768 9241710 9396465 9545414 16113830 15921724 16488980 17597997 18403391 18680534 19277406 19278955 19765210 20141580 20802025 20978711 21392254 18160668 10721613 11038326
22205395	Genome-wide associated loci influencing interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 levels in African Americans.	Interleukins (ILs) are key mediators of the immune response and inflammatory process. Plasma levels of IL-10, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 are associated with metabolic conditions, show large inter-individual variations, and are under strong genetic control. Therefore, elucidation of the genetic variants that influence levels of these ILs provides useful insights into mechanisms of immune response and pathogenesis of diseases. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of IL-10, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 levels in 707 non-diabetic African Americans using 5,396,780 imputed and directly genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with adjustment for gender, age, and body mass index. IL-10 levels showed genome-wide significant associations (p  < 5 × 10(-8)) with eight SNPs, the most significant of which was rs5743185 in the PMS1 gene (p = 2.30 × 10(-10)). We tested replication of SNPs that showed genome-wide significance in 425 non-diabetic individuals from West Africa, and successfully replicated rs17365948 in the YWHAZ gene (p = 0.02). IL-1Ra levels showed suggestive associations with two SNPs in the ASB3 gene (p = 2.55 × 10(-7)), ten SNPs in the IL-1 gene family (IL1F5, IL1F8, IL1F10, and IL1Ra, p = 1.04 × 10(-6) to 1.75 × 10(-6)), and 23 SNPs near the IL1A gene (p = 1.22 × 10(-6) to 1.63 × 10(-6)). We also successfully replicated rs4251961 (p = 0.009); this SNP was reported to be associated with IL-1Ra levels in a candidate gene study of Europeans. IL-6 levels showed genome-wide significant association with one SNP (RP11-314E23.1; chr6:133397598; p = 8.63 × 10(-9)). To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS on IL-10, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 levels. Follow-up of these findings may provide valuable insight into the pathobiology of IL actions and dysregulations in inflammation and human diseases.	 11238636 21796257 11991722 12424622 12519862 12716739 12958120 14988271 15005841 9217780 9710237 9769329 10512743 15674372 15864338 16235156 16311216 16823477 16862161 17148452 17174563 17443229 17701901 17851695 18237431 18256235 21956416 18451331 18414778 18673007 18776908 19130178 19038572 19468064 19201467 19609347 20081871 20169177 19798069 20053959 19918757 20521902 20616382 19492200 19430479 20937099 20836156 21058334 21233852 21305825 21255436 21263114 11345194
22171074	A genome-wide association and gene-environment interaction study for serum triglycerides levels in a healthy Chinese male population.	Triglyceride (TG) is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes or loci affecting lipid levels; however, such studies in Chinese populations are limited. A two-stage GWAS were conducted to identify genetic variants that were associated with TG in a Chinese population of 3495 men. Gene-environment interactions on serum TG levels were further investigated for the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were studied in both stages. Two previously reported SNPs (rs651821 in APOA5, rs328 in LPL) were replicated in the second stage, and the combined P-values were 9.19 × 10(-26) and 1.41 × 10(-9) for rs651821 and rs328, respectively. More importantly, a significant interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 and alcohol consumption on serum TG levels were observed (P = 3.34 × 10(-5)). Rs671 was significantly associated with serum TG levels in drinkers (P = 1.90 × 10(-10)), while no association was observed in non-drinkers (P > 0.05). For drinkers, men carrying the AA/AG genotype have significantly lower serum TG levels, compared with men carrying the GG genotype. For men with the GG genotype, the serum TG levels increased with the quantity of alcohol intake (P = 1.28 × 10(-8) for trend test). We identified a novel, significant interaction effect between alcohol consumption and the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism on TG levels, which suggests that the effect of alcohol intake on TG occurs in a two-faceted manner. Just one drink can increase TG level in susceptible individuals who carry the GG genotype, while individuals carrying AA/AG genotypes may actually benefit from moderate drinking.	
22210626	Genome-wide association study in multiple human prion diseases suggests genetic risk factors additional to PRNP.	Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals caused by the misfolding and aggregation of prion protein (PrP). Mammalian prion diseases are under strong genetic control but few risk factors are known aside from the PrP gene locus (PRNP). No genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been done aside from a small sample of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). We conducted GWAS of sporadic CJD (sCJD), variant CJD (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, inherited prion disease, kuru and resistance to kuru despite attendance at mortuary feasts. After quality control, we analysed 2000 samples and 6015 control individuals (provided by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and KORA-gen) for 491032-511862 SNPs in the European study. Association studies were done in each geographical and aetiological group followed by several combined analyses. The PRNP locus was highly associated with risk in all geographical and aetiological groups. This association was driven by the known coding variation at rs1799990 (PRNP codon 129). No non-PRNP loci achieved genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of all human prion disease. SNPs at the ZBTB38-RASA2 locus were associated with CJD in the UK (rs295301, P = 3.13 × 10(-8); OR, 0.70) but these SNPs showed no replication evidence of association in German sCJD or in Papua New Guinea-based tests. A SNP in the CHN2 gene was associated with vCJD [P = 1.5 × 10(-7); odds ratio (OR), 2.36], but not in UK sCJD (P = 0.049; OR, 1.24), in German sCJD or in PNG groups. In the overall meta-analysis of CJD, 14 SNPs were associated (P < 10(-5); two at PRNP, three at ZBTB38-RASA2, nine at nine other independent non-PRNP loci), more than would be expected by chance. None of the loci recently identified as genome-wide significant in studies of other neurodegenerative diseases showed any clear evidence of association in prion diseases. Concerning common genetic variation, it is likely that the PRNP locus contains the only strong risk factors that act universally across human prion diseases. Our data are most consistent with several other risk loci of modest overall effects which will require further genetic association studies to provide definitive evidence.	 19965731 19915575 20154673 20801717 11013074 11283320 11315092 11353827 11704923 12034503 12481985 12764055 1675319 1677164 1352724 8878476 9333232 9333239 9482303 15965195 16923955 16990547 17047093 17554300 17572673 17701901 17991853 18074392 18391951 18716560 18849290 18757886 18805828 19081515 19214206 18729123 19543373 19734902 19923577 19434714
22864933	Identification of novel germline polymorphisms governing capecitabine sensitivity.	Capecitabine, an oral 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrug, is widely used in the treatment of breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers. To guide the selection of patients with potentially the greatest benefit of experiencing antitumor efficacy, or, alternatively, of developing toxicities, identifying genomic predictors of capecitabine sensitivity could permit its more informed use.	 10909856 18451141 11291832 11315092 12454317 12453332 10521338 15763604 15890408 16255080 17000685 17203168 17324113 17537913 17701890 17943122 18034621 18313023 18505340 18675275 18765826 19164090 19200528 19089452 19109566 19247178 19543370 19622575 19662163 20038569 20393316 20616382 20811451 20549016 20814815 20142840 21109222 21176216 21497773 21048041 21204909 21415237 18398418 11031099
22238593	A genome-wide association search for type 2 diabetes genes in African Americans.	African Americans are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2DM) yet few studies have examined T2DM using genome-wide association approaches in this ethnicity. The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with T2DM in the African American population. We performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using the Affymetrix 6.0 array in 965 African-American cases with T2DM and end-stage renal disease (T2DM-ESRD) and 1029 population-based controls. The most significant SNPs (n = 550 independent loci) were genotyped in a replication cohort and 122 SNPs (n = 98 independent loci) were further tested through genotyping three additional validation cohorts followed by meta-analysis in all five cohorts totaling 3,132 cases and 3,317 controls. Twelve SNPs had evidence of association in the GWAS (P<0.0071), were directionally consistent in the Replication cohort and were associated with T2DM in subjects without nephropathy (P<0.05). Meta-analysis in all cases and controls revealed a single SNP reaching genome-wide significance (P<2.5×10(-8)). SNP rs7560163 (P = 7.0×10(-9), OR (95% CI) = 0.75 (0.67-0.84)) is located intergenically between RND3 and RBM43. Four additional loci (rs7542900, rs4659485, rs2722769 and rs7107217) were associated with T2DM (P<0.05) and reached more nominal levels of significance (P<2.5×10(-5)) in the overall analysis and may represent novel loci that contribute to T2DM. We have identified novel T2DM-susceptibility variants in the African-American population. Notably, T2DM risk was associated with the major allele and implies an interesting genetic architecture in this population. These results suggest that multiple loci underlie T2DM susceptibility in the African-American population and that these loci are distinct from those identified in other ethnic populations.	 18443202 16135132 17463246 8649376 15800003 17246646 18193043 19060908 19177153 15717870 17463249 16415884 17943122 9543099 12540637 19060907 12029063 20581827 9531558 19567477 17460697 18711367 15111519 21150874 15712363 12486129 12684185 17327436 18794854 17463248 16732006 15136493 18794856 18711366 9545414 9634505 19734900 17293876 11278942 17554300 10973253 18204446 18952314 18372903 8680609 17873874 17601994 17563454 17603484 19060909 19215730 18252897 20081858 18654799
22219177	A genome-wide search for loci interacting with known prostate cancer risk-associated genetic variants.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ∼30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) consistently associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk. To test the hypothesis that other sequence variants in the genome may interact with those 32 known PCa risk-associated SNPs identified from GWAS to affect PCa risk, we performed a systematic evaluation among three existing PCa GWAS populations: CAncer of the Prostate in Sweden population, a Johns Hopkins Hospital population, and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility population, with a total sample size of 4723 PCa cases and 4792 control subjects. Meta-analysis of the interaction term between each of those 32 SNPs and SNPs in the genome was performed in three PCa GWAS populations. The most significant interaction detected was between rs12418451 in MYEOV and rs784411 in CEP152, with a P(interaction) of 1.15 × 10(-7) in the meta-analysis. In addition, we emphasized two pairs of interactions with potential biological implication, including an interaction between rs7127900 near insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2)/IGF2AS and rs12628051 in TNRC6B, with a P(interaction) of 3.39 × 10(-6) and an interaction between rs7679763 near TET2 and rs290258 in SYK, with a P(interaction) of 1.49 × 10(-6). Those results show statistical evidence for novel loci interacting with known risk-associated SNPs to modify PCa risk. The interacting loci identified provide hints on the underlying molecular mechanism of the associations with PCa risk for the known risk-associated SNPs. Additional studies are warranted to further confirm the interaction effects detected in this study.	 21086786 21181894 21071540 21112326 21131973 21168469 21390317 21372204 21632467 10753852 11253063 11454707 12202983 12448002 12637750 12646957 12804639 14745835 15090460 15208665 9815946 16678123 16682969 16862161 16442709 17401363 17401366 17572673 17603485 17701901 18073375 18264096 18264097 18264098 18361410 18708398 19117981 19318570 19505914 19420352 19767753 19767754 19767755 19726753 19843644 19866473 20080650 19434077 20388800 21059850

22245343	A large scale multivariate parallel ICA method reveals novel imaging-genetic relationships for Alzheimer's disease in the ADNI cohort.	The underlying genetic etiology of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) remains largely unknown, likely due to its polygenic architecture and a lack of sophisticated analytic methods to evaluate complex genotype-phenotype models. The aim of the current study was to overcome these limitations in a bi-multivariate fashion by linking intermediate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes with a genome-wide sample of common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants. We compared associations between 94 different brain regions of interest derived from structural MRI scans and 533,872 genome-wide SNPs using a novel multivariate statistical procedure, parallel-independent component analysis, in a large, national multi-center subject cohort. The study included 209 elderly healthy controls, 367 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 181 with mild, early-stage LOAD, all of them Caucasian adults, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Imaging was performed on comparable 1.5 T scanners at over 50 sites in the USA/Canada. Four primary "genetic components" were associated significantly with a single structural network including all regions involved neuropathologically in LOAD. Pathway analysis suggested that each component included several genes already known to contribute to LOAD risk (e.g. APOE4) or involved in pathologic processes contributing to the disorder, including inflammation, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. In addition significant novel genes identified included ZNF673, VPS13, SLC9A7, ATP5G2 and SHROOM2. Unlike conventional analyses, this multivariate approach identified distinct groups of genes that are plausibly linked in physiologic pathways, perhaps epistatically. Further, the study exemplifies the value of this novel approach to explore large-scale data sets involving high-dimensional gene and endophenotype data.	 21460841 19690986 12415294 19298596 17317784 20968046 8446617 19595867 17186461 20957767 20594621 20451869 21068297 19874150 16385466 20300123 20100581 16461860 19834575 18654930 19479823 20517686 19786950 11300724 20691945 15840657 19944766 21045163 11559959 19804566 17268475 20623542 19734902 20061644 18269210 20581814 19721814 18272596 18048067 19358976 20950559 15615712 20451875 19760173 16770605 12909083 20460622 20935035 21143154 18940803 18057008 19668339 8579105 20410104 19059344 20558387 20081857 20691427 20955927
22229870	Genome-wide association of serum uric acid concentration: replication of sequence variants in an island population of the Adriatic coast of Croatia.	A genome-wide association study of serum uric acid (SUA) laevels was performed in a relatively isolated population of European descent from an island of the Adriatic coast of Croatia. The study sample included 532 unrelated and 768 related individuals from 235 pedigrees. Inflation due to relatedness was controlled by using genomic control. Genetic association was assessed with 2,241,249 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1300 samples after adjusting for age and gender. Our study replicated four previously reported SUA loci (SLC2A9, ABCG2, RREB1, and SLC22A12). The strongest association was found with a SNP in SLC2A9 (rs13129697, P=2.33×10(-19)), which exhibited significant gender-specific effects, 35.76 μmol/L (P=2.11×10(-19)) in females and 19.58 μmol/L (P=5.40×10(-5)) in males. Within this region of high linkage disequilibrium, we also detected a strong association with a nonsynonymous SNP, rs16890979 (P=2.24×10(-17)), a putative causal variant for SUA variation. In addition, we identified several novel loci suggestive of association with uric acid levels (SEMA5A, TMEM18, SLC28A2, and ODZ2), although the P-values (P<5×10(-6)) did not reach the threshold of genome-wide significance. Together, these findings provide further confirmation of previously reported uric-acid-related genetic variants and highlight suggestive new loci for additional investigation.	 10699370 21294900 11754464 11754475 577077 2012455 8781463 16252231 16240356 17189563 17384015 17584757 17943122 17954784 18060068 18179892 18327256 18327257 17997608 18759275 18834626 19260141 19503597 19715440 19812673 19906825 20442772 20634204 20884846 21150882 11315092
22232737	Novel genetic markers of breast cancer survival identified by a genome-wide association study.	Only two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to date to identify potential markers for total mortality after diagnosis of breast cancer. Here, we report the identification of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with total mortality from a two-stage GWAS conducted among 6,110 Shanghai-resident Chinese women with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I to IV breast cancer. The discovery stage included 1,950 patients and evaluated 613,031 common SNPs. The top 49 associations were evaluated in an independent replication stage of 4,160 Shanghai patients with breast cancer. A consistent and highly significant association with total mortality was documented for SNPs rs3784099 and rs9934948. SNP rs3784099, located in the RAD51L1 gene, was associated with total morality in both the discovery stage (P = 1.44 × 10(-8)) and replication stage (P = 0.06; P-combined = 1.17 × 10(-7)). Adjusted HRs for total mortality were 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.68] for the AG genotype and 2.64 (95% CI, 1.74-4.03) for the AA genotype, when compared with the GG genotype. The variant C allele of rs9934948, located on chromosome 16, was associated with a similarly elevated risk of total mortality (P-combined = 5.75 × 10(-6)). We also observed this association among 1,145 patients with breast cancer of European ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; P = 0.006); the association was highly significant in a combined analysis of NHS and Chinese data (P = 1.39 × 10(-7)). Similar associations were observed for these two SNPs with breast cancer-specific mortality. This study provides strong evidence suggesting that the RAD51L1 gene and a chromosome 16 locus influence breast cancer prognosis.	 17062678 16236996 17529974 17529967 17701901 18511948 18798254 19082494 19219042 19330030 19329439 19629072 19564533 19996398 19933162 20048185 20332263 20308648 20453838 20585626 20484103 20852631 21172892 11016747 11118465 11389533 11960320 14504205 14871809 15257466 9228274 9973226 15668481 15723711 15958542 16243804 17529973
22233651	A genome-wide association study of gestational diabetes mellitus in Korean women.	Knowledge regarding the genetic risk loci for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is still limited. In this study, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association analysis in Korean women. In the stage 1 genome scan, 468 women with GDM and 1,242 nondiabetic control women were compared using 2.19 million genotyped or imputed markers. We selected 11 loci for further genotyping in stage 2 samples of 931 case and 783 control subjects. The joint effect of stage 1 plus stage 2 studies was analyzed by meta-analysis. We also investigated the effect of known type 2 diabetes variants in GDM. Two loci known to be associated with type 2 diabetes had a genome-wide significant association with GDM in the joint analysis. rs7754840, a variant in CDKAL1, had the strongest association with GDM (odds ratio 1.518; P=6.65×10(-16)). A variant near MTNR1B, rs10830962, was also significantly associated with the risk of GDM (1.454; P=2.49×10(-13)). We found that there is an excess of association between known type 2 diabetes variants and GDM above what is expected under the null hypothesis. In conclusion, we have confirmed that genetic variants in CDKAL1 and near MTNR1B are strongly associated with GDM in Korean women. There seems to be a shared genetic basis between GDM and type 2 diabetes.	 17463246 20818381 19060908 8299456 17463249 11722247 21378178 20606385 19715440 21112029 17572673 1748259 18469204 19060907 11882646 20581827 18456364 17460697 20616382 8635631 22158537 16415888 19228808 12351492 17463248 11238474 17293876 17554300 21037257 19812666 21537406 19002430 15765129 20634204 17701901 21658282 18372903 18984664 20581837 19396169 17975067 12879403 20174558 19060909 20081858 11237011 3899825 20208533

To identify genetic factors that would be predictive of individuals who require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), we conducted a genome-wide association study among individuals with an ICD who experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia (LTA; cases) vs. those who did not over at least a 3-year period (controls).	 17922574 17549752 18288182 18955676 19020326 19204306 19305408 19264985 19617719 19619699 20062060 20062061 20062063 20130649 20173747 20403488 20400777 20647212 20622880 20657596 21058334 20924194 19305409 8817324 9445167 10209001 16648850 16940195 17341461 17478681 17603472 17701901 17709759 17921354
22443383	Genome wide association study for plasma levels of natural anticoagulant inhibitors and protein C anticoagulant pathway: the MARTHA project.	Deficiencies of antithrombin (AT), protein C (PC) and protein S (PS) or an impaired PC anticoagulant pathway increase the risk of venous thrombosis (VT). By conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on two independent samples of VT patients totalling 951 subjects typed for 472 173 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we observed that common SNPs explain 21% and 27% of the genetic variance of plasma AT and PS levels, even though no SNP reached genome-wide significance. For PC, we showed that two PROCR SNPs, rs867186 (Ser219Gly) and rs6060278, additionally explained c. 20% (P = 1·19 × 10(-31)) of the variance of plasma PC levels. We also observed that c. 40% of the remaining genetic variance of PC levels could be due to yet unidentified common SNPs. The PROCR locus was also found to explain c. 8% (P < 10(-10)) of agkistrodon contortrix venom (ACV) (exploring the PC pathway) variability which was under the main control of the F5 and F2 loci that further explained about 40% and 10%, respectively. We presented here the first GWAS for plasma AT and free-PS levels and ACV in Caucasian samples. We identified three independent loci associated with ACV (F2, F5 and PROCR) and replicated two independent effects on plasma PC levels at the PROCR locus.	
22388998	Genome-wide association study of N370S homozygous Gaucher disease reveals the candidacy of CLN8 gene as a genetic modifier contributing to extreme phenotypic variation.	Mutations in GBA1 gene result in defective acid β-glucosidase and the complex phenotype of Gaucher disease (GD) related to the accumulation of glucosylceramide-laden macrophages. The phenotype is highly variable even among patients harboring identical GBA1 mutations. We hypothesize that modifier gene(s) underlie phenotypic diversity in GD and performed a GWAS study in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with type 1 GD (GD1), homozygous for N370S mutation. Patients were assigned to mild, moderate, or severe disease categories using composite disease severity scoring systems. Whole-genome genotyping for >500,000 SNPs was performed to search for association signals using OQLS algorithm in 139 eligible patients. Several SNPs in linkage disequilibrium within the CLN8 gene locus were associated with the GD1 severity: SNP rs11986414 was associated with GD1 severity at P value 1.26 × 10(-6) . Compared to mild disease, risk allele A at rs11986414 conferred an odds ratio of 3.72 for moderate/severe disease. Loss of function mutations in CLN8 causes neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis, but our results indicate that its increased expression may protect against severe GD1. In cultured skin fibroblasts, the relative expression of CLN8 was higher in mild GD compared to severely affected patients, in whom CLN8 risk alleles were overrepresented. In an in vitro cell model of GD, CLN8 expression was increased, which was further enhanced in the presence of bioactive substrate, glucosylsphingosine. Taken together, CLN8 is a candidate modifier gene for GD1 that may function as a protective sphingolipid sensor and/or in glycosphingolipid trafficking. Future studies should explore the role of CLN8 in pathophysiology of GD.	 20027115 18974171 21209725 19784695 18819093 19333967 11694577 21445610 8450045 19732054 19260119 8434610 15028849 21056933 19919682 17634446 20421485 18501647 19094956 12401882 15574124 21080341 15075390 1435229 15297300 10861296 15919211 16086686 20728381 6289358 20049528 21990111 15937077 14526090 10777718 16000318 19279008 16954197 17701901 12489486 17080304 10464619 17668381 20962279 10508524 9497856 8215980 18846210 19268722 15813845 15160397 15669682 12482401 12897342
22267201	Meta-analyses identify 13 loci associated with age at menopause and highlight DNA repair and immune pathways.	To newly identify loci for age at natural menopause, we carried out a meta-analysis of 22 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 38,968 women of European descent, with replication in up to 14,435 women. In addition to four known loci, we identified 13 loci newly associated with age at natural menopause (at P < 5 × 10(-8)). Candidate genes located at these newly associated loci include genes implicated in DNA repair (EXO1, HELQ, UIMC1, FAM175A, FANCI, TLK1, POLG and PRIM1) and immune function (IL11, NLRP11 and PRRC2A (also known as BAT2)). Gene-set enrichment pathway analyses using the full GWAS data set identified exoDNase, NF-κB signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction as biological processes related to timing of menopause.	 12419851 21504893 20502693 11751861 15317747 19448621 17873877 9988222 7996857 19897680 19966036 8931899 20714348 15879922 19589949 15326356 12806118 17540727 20734064 12915441 12563287 18344981 10433232 17970776 20833654 15059956 9626112 16618710 19128478 19654370 18193047 18462017 9922105 15533358 17140574 10716976 16595552 9500603 7868665 16077740 9871906 20616382 20354512 19698732 19448619 20485568 15820835 15164064 8530050 17701902 20647212 19557189 15367665 18305346 12629043 19644074 17873875 11879775 21506106 1581960 15769979 9871905 9020850 19222302 20634204 12099629 19561590 10487678 9034788 19361613 18724044 17873874 20351726 8126148 20395656 14501610 5327241 20150277 19966804
22267200	Discovery of common variants associated with low TSH levels and thyroid cancer risk.	To search for sequence variants conferring risk of nonmedullary thyroid cancer, we focused our analysis on 22 SNPs with a P < 5 × 10(-8) in a genome-wide association study on levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in 27,758 Icelanders. Of those, rs965513 has previously been shown to associate with thyroid cancer. The remaining 21 SNPs were genotyped in 561 Icelandic individuals with thyroid cancer (cases) and up to 40,013 controls. Variants suggestively associated with thyroid cancer (P < 0.05) were genotyped in an additional 595 non-Icelandic cases and 2,604 controls. After combining the results, three variants were shown to associate with thyroid cancer: rs966423 on 2q35 (OR = 1.34; P(combined) = 1.3 × 10(-9)), rs2439302 on 8p12 (OR = 1.36; P(combined) = 2.0 × 10(-9)) and rs116909374 on 14q13.3 (OR = 2.09; P(combined) = 4.6 × 10(-11)), a region previously reported to contain an uncorrelated variant conferring risk of thyroid cancer. A strong association (P = 9.1 × 10(-91)) was observed between rs2439302 on 8p12 and expression of NRG1, which encodes the signaling protein neuregulin 1, in blood.	 11039572 21983786 11979442 12145742 7932824 15581879 15630470 16053381 16557281 17012270 17131411 17568781 18344981 18474871 18514160 18559567 19147577 19165921 19164563 19196962 19198613 19730683 20350937 20826269 20981099 21367965 21565293 21946351 21964575 11303513
22291604	A genome-wide association study identified AFF1 as a susceptibility locus for systemic lupus eyrthematosus in Japanese.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that causes multiple organ damage. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed to discovery of SLE susceptibility genes, few studies has been performed in Asian populations. Here, we report a GWAS for SLE examining 891 SLE cases and 3,384 controls and multi-stage replication studies examining 1,387 SLE cases and 28,564 controls in Japanese subjects. Considering that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been implicated in genetic risks for autoimmune diseases, we integrated an eQTL study into the results of the GWAS. We observed enrichments of cis-eQTL positive loci among the known SLE susceptibility loci (30.8%) compared to the genome-wide SNPs (6.9%). In addition, we identified a novel association of a variant in the AF4/FMR2 family, member 1 (AFF1) gene at 4q21 with SLE susceptibility (rs340630; P = 8.3×10(-9), odds ratio = 1.21). The risk A allele of rs340630 demonstrated a cis-eQTL effect on the AFF1 transcript with enhanced expression levels (P<0.05). As AFF1 transcripts were prominently expressed in CD4(+) and CD19(+) peripheral blood lymphocytes, up-regulation of AFF1 may cause the abnormality in these lymphocytes, leading to disease onset.	 17804842 17701901 17982410 18059267 18204446 18204447 18204448 18204098 18462017 18794858 18817904 18974171 19165918 19165919 19223927 19557189 19715440 19838193 19838195 20074509 20112363 20169177 20190752 20194224 20453841 20453842 20562875 20716579 21194677 21044949 10887138 11526379 12058956 14685227 7979581 9324032 10405936 15657875 16169901 16642019 16761508 21196492 21441907 16862161 17160900 17412832 17873874
22291609	A genome-wide association scan on the levels of markers of inflammation in Sardinians reveals associations that underpin its complex regulation.	Identifying the genes that influence levels of pro-inflammatory molecules can help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process. We first conducted a two-stage genome-wide association scan (GWAS) for the key inflammatory biomarkers Interleukin-6 (IL-6), the general measure of inflammation erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in a large cohort of individuals from the founder population of Sardinia. By analysing 731,213 autosomal or X chromosome SNPs and an additional ∼1.9 million imputed variants in 4,694 individuals, we identified several SNPs associated with the selected quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and replicated all the top signals in an independent sample of 1,392 individuals from the same population. Next, to increase power to detect and resolve associations, we further genotyped the whole cohort (6,145 individuals) for 293,875 variants included on the ImmunoChip and MetaboChip custom arrays. Overall, our combined approach led to the identification of 9 genome-wide significant novel independent signals-5 of which were identified only with the custom arrays-and provided confirmatory evidence for an additional 7. Novel signals include: for IL-6, in the ABO gene (rs657152, p = 2.13×10(-29)); for ESR, at the HBB (rs4910472, p = 2.31×10(-11)) and UCN119B/SPPL3 (rs11829037, p = 8.91×10(-10)) loci; for MCP-1, near its receptor CCR2 (rs17141006, p = 7.53×10(-13)) and in CADM3 (rs3026968, p = 7.63×10(-13)); for hsCRP, within the CRP gene (rs3093077, p = 5.73×10(-21)), near DARC (rs3845624, p = 1.43×10(-10)), UNC119B/SPPL3 (rs11829037, p = 1.50×10(-14)), and ICOSLG/AIRE (rs113459440, p = 1.54×10(-08)) loci. Confirmatory evidence was found for IL-6 in the IL-6R gene (rs4129267); for ESR at CR1 (rs12567990) and TMEM57 (rs10903129); for MCP-1 at DARC (rs12075); and for hsCRP at CRP (rs1205), HNF1A (rs225918), and APOC-I (rs4420638). Our results improve the current knowledge of genetic variants underlying inflammation and provide novel clues for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating this complex process.	 21505073 18604267 21297633 19197348 8990222 20453840 20694147 17658951 18193045 18193043 18464913 9614933 18003641 17357077 18439548 21345260 17943122 17921354 20560212 20190752 21829380 16159603 21223965 19060907 16001361 18514160 18776908 20040767 18439552 21300955 21804639 19820697 19430480 18940312 21239051 18245381 21700265 11731797 21072187 19060911 17903293 21058334 16934002 14694201 17554300 14645206 19648918 20923989 20634204 19305409 19953080 11230178 15471889 21833088 17924335 20360734 10753728 11382718 21593778 20081857 7833467 20167578 19674758 20208533

22286173	Genome-wide association study for intracranial aneurysm in the Japanese population identifies three candidate susceptible loci and a functional genetic variant at EDNRA.	Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is the most serious subtype of stroke. Genetic factors have been known to play an important role in the development of intracranial aneurysm (IA), some of which further progress to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify common genetic variants that are associated with the risk of IA, using 1383 aSAH subjects and 5484 control individuals in the Japanese population. We selected 36 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed suggestive association (P <1 × 10(-4)) in the GWAS as well as additional 7 SNPs that were previously reported to be associated with IA, and further genotyped an additional set of 1048 IA cases and 7212 controls. We identified an SNP, rs6842241, near EDNRA at chromosome 4q31.22 (combined P-value = 9.58 × 10(-9); odds ratio = 1.25), which was found to be significantly associated with IA. Additionally, we successfully replicated and validated rs10757272 on CDKN2BAS at chromosome 9p21.3 (combined P-value = 1.55 × 10(-7); odds ratio = 1.21) to be significantly associated with IA as previously reported. Furthermore, we performed functional analysis with the associated genetic variants on EDNRA, and identified two alleles of rs6841581 that have different binding affinities to a nuclear protein(s). The transcriptional activity of the susceptible allele of this variant was significantly lower than the other, suggesting that this functional variant might affect the expression of EDNRA and subsequently result in the IA susceptibility. Identification of genetic variants on EDNRA is of clinical significance probably due to its role in vessel hemodynamic stress. Our findings should contribute to a better understanding of physiopathology of IA.	
22286170	The combination of a genome-wide association study of lymphocyte count and analysis of gene expression data reveals novel asthma candidate genes.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of novel genetic associations with complex human diseases. In spite of these successes, results from GWAS generally explain only a small proportion of disease heritability, an observation termed the 'missing heritability problem'. Several sources for the missing heritability have been proposed, including the contribution of many common variants with small individual effect sizes, which cannot be reliably found using the standard GWAS approach. The goal of our study was to explore a complimentary approach, which combines GWAS results with functional data in order to identify novel genetic associations with small effect sizes. To do so, we conducted a GWAS for lymphocyte count, a physiologic quantitative trait associated with asthma, in 462 Hutterites. In parallel, we performed a genome-wide gene expression study in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 96 Hutterites. We found significant support for genetic associations using the GWAS data when we considered variants near the 193 genes whose expression levels across individuals were most correlated with lymphocyte counts. Interestingly, these variants are also enriched with signatures of an association with asthma susceptibility, an observation we were able to replicate. The associated loci include genes previously implicated in asthma susceptibility as well as novel candidate genes enriched for functions related to T cell receptor signaling and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Our results, therefore, establish a new set of asthma susceptibility candidate genes. More generally, our observations support the notion that many loci of small effects influence variation in lymphocyte count and asthma susceptibility.	 18846210 18974828 18987709 19043577 18974171 18791227 18971308 19124843 19365135 19644074 19732864 19812666 19671653 19880382 19864262 20069535 20369019 20369022 21271314 21317389 21376301 21289059 21552331 21546069 21374718 15461798 10592173 10677322 10802651 19264973 19498061 11022011 11590547 11880950 12154374 12883005 14681465 21738478 21738479 21738480 21447379 21804549 21610747 21875956 21878675 22042701 21465548 15866171 16251966 16429159 16395390 16579875 16751344 20463879 20479774 20502693 20532202 20562875 20581876 20636818 20234388 20372189 20634204 20860503 20738864 20969590 20935630 20833654 20142840 21129726 20709383 16818670 17010591 17122850 17289997 17526521 17611496 17873874 18301422 18403759 18467348 18776909
22286219	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci influencing human serum metabolite levels.	Nuclear magnetic resonance assays allow for measurement of a wide range of metabolic phenotypes. We report here the results of a GWAS on 8,330 Finnish individuals genotyped and imputed at 7.7 million SNPs for a range of 216 serum metabolic phenotypes assessed by NMR of serum samples. We identified significant associations (P < 2.31 × 10(-10)) at 31 loci, including 11 for which there have not been previous reports of associations to a metabolic trait or disorder. Analyses of Finnish twin pairs suggested that the metabolic measures reported here show higher heritability than comparable conventional metabolic phenotypes. In accordance with our expectations, SNPs at the 31 loci associated with individual metabolites account for a greater proportion of the genetic component of trait variance (up to 40%) than is typically observed for conventional serum metabolic phenotypes. The identification of such associations may provide substantial insight into cardiometabolic disorders.	 16443434 17053192 17318336 17384015 17572673 17846035 18179892 18193043 18193044 18451265 19043545 19060907 19060911 19503597 19474294 19407809 19684899 19936222 20037589 20081858 20097865 20509871 20686565 20811451 20844574 20810666 20981092 21058334 21129726 20717559 21423183 21886157 11839776 12200056 15300429 62115 7425647 1357662 9297575 13629788 15823385 15840693 16030068

22290723	Association of glycosylated hemoglobin with the gene encoding CDKAL1 in the Korean Association Resource (KARE) study.	Genome-wide associations with glycosylated hemoglobin, which reflects the long-term glycemia, were examined using two independent cohorts of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) consortium. We first identified sequence variants within a linkage disequilibrium block (r(2) > 0.98) in the intron 5 of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) gene using 4,275 normoglycemic subjects of Cohort 1 (P < 2.5 × 10(-8)). The association was replicated in 3,782 normoglycemic subjects of Cohort 2. Furthermore, the sequence variants were also associated with glucose levels after oral glucose tolerance test. Especially, a strong association with 1 h glucose (P = 1.3 × 10(-11)) led us to interpreting that CDKAL1 might influence the level of glycosylated hemoglobin by affecting 1 h glucose level. Ultimately, accumulated effects on the glycosylated hemoglobin level by the genetic variation of CDKAL1 might affect susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus.	
22293688	1000 Genomes-based imputation identifies novel and refined associations for the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium phase 1 Data.	We hypothesize that imputation based on data from the 1000 Genomes Project can identify novel association signals on a genome-wide scale due to the dense marker map and the large number of haplotypes. To test the hypothesis, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) Phase I genotype data were imputed using 1000 genomes as reference (20100804 EUR), and seven case/control association studies were performed using imputed dosages. We observed two 'missed' disease-associated variants that were undetectable by the original WTCCC analysis, but were reported by later studies after the 2007 WTCCC publication. One is within the IL2RA gene for association with type 1 diabetes and the other in proximity with the CDKN2B gene for association with type 2 diabetes. We also identified two refined associations. One is SNP rs11209026 in exon 9 of IL23R for association with Crohn's disease, which is predicted to be probably damaging by PolyPhen2. The other refined variant is in the CUX2 gene region for association with type 1 diabetes, where the newly identified top SNP rs1265564 has an association P-value of 1.68 × 10(-16). The new lead SNP for the two refined loci provides a more plausible explanation for the disease association. We demonstrated that 1000 Genomes-based imputation could indeed identify both novel (in our case, 'missed' because they were detected and replicated by studies after 2007) and refined signals.

After imputation of data from the 1000 Genomes Project into a genome-wide dataset of Ghanaian individuals with tuberculosis and controls, we identified a resistance locus on chromosome 11p13 downstream of the WT1 gene (encoding Wilms tumor 1). The strongest signal was obtained at the rs2057178 SNP (P = 2.63 × 10(-9)). Replication in Gambian, Indonesian and Russian tuberculosis case-control study cohorts increased the significance level for the association with this SNP to P = 2.57 × 10(-11).	 11244032 11050081 15687028 19215730 19750224 21349089 20694014 20974136 21058334 21248786 20206579
22306654	Common variants near MBNL1 and NKX2-5 are associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.	Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a severe condition characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 1,001 surgery-confirmed cases and 2,401 controls from Denmark. The six most strongly associated loci were tested in a replication set of 796 cases and 876 controls. Three SNPs reached genome-wide significance. One of these SNPs, rs11712066 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.61; P = 1.5 × 10(-17)) at 3p25.1, is located 150 kb upstream of MBNL1, which encodes a factor that regulates splicing transitions occurring shortly after birth. The second SNP, rs573872 (OR = 1.41; P = 4.3 × 10(-12)), maps to an intergenic region at 3p25.2 approximately 1.3 Mb downstream of MBNL1. The third SNP, rs29784 (OR = 1.42; P = 1.5 × 10(-15)) at 5q35.2, is 64 kb downstream of NKX2-5, which is involved in development of cardiac muscle tissue and embryonic gut development.	 16717059 16477261 19028966 18978789 19075228 19741700 19660448 19760199 20062060 20551410 20616382 20634204 20981092 20725931 21058334 20634200 21526222 21374718 21736982 10609814 10617196 10934012 11315092 12111919 15257297 3957000 8237916 8605461 9373863 9598591 9778503 17701901
22306652	Genome-wide association study identifies a variant in HDAC9 associated with large vessel ischemic stroke.	Genetic factors have been implicated in stroke risk, but few replicated associations have been reported. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for ischemic stroke and its subtypes in 3,548 affected individuals and 5,972 controls, all of European ancestry. Replication of potential signals was performed in 5,859 affected individuals and 6,281 controls. We replicated previous associations for cardioembolic stroke near PITX2 and ZFHX3 and for large vessel stroke at a 9p21 locus. We identified a new association for large vessel stroke within HDAC9 (encoding histone deacetylase 9) on chromosome 7p21.1 (including further replication in an additional 735 affected individuals and 28,583 controls) (rs11984041; combined P = 1.87 × 10(-11); odds ratio (OR) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28-1.57). All four loci exhibited evidence for heterogeneity of effect across the stroke subtypes, with some and possibly all affecting risk for only one subtype. This suggests distinct genetic architectures for different stroke subtypes.	 21148441 7678184 2712533 18991354 17846035 24323551 17206144 19475673 20957003 19369658 19478231 20686565 20581827 10716917 19812545 19200528 20671249 17239802 22057162 19065135 19597491 12714707 20953190 21044948 19430483 15367668 19543373 20410525 12589032
22319020	A genome-wide association study for coronary artery disease identifies a novel susceptibility locus in the major histocompatibility complex.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several novel loci that reproducibly associate with coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or myocardial infarction risk. However, known common CAD risk variants explain only 10% of the predicted genetic heritability of the disease, suggesting that important genetic signals remain to be discovered.	 11315092 21378986 14702425 15138242 15175864 9887164 15821736 16862161 16998491 17554300 17478679 17478681 17572673 17517687 17634449 17938300 18179884 18208327 18797516 18758442 19198609 19198611 19198612 19543373 19915572 20428172 20634204 21088011 21239051 21321594 21378988 21378990 21300701 21502963 21606135 12426569
22310353	Beyond single-marker analyses: mining whole genome scans for insights into treatment responses in severe sepsis.	Management of severe sepsis, an acute illness with high morbidity and mortality, suffers from the lack of effective biomarkers and largely empirical predictions of disease progression and therapeutic responses. We conducted a genome-wide association study using a large randomized clinical trial cohort to discover genetic biomarkers of response to therapy and prognosis utilizing novel approaches, including combination markers, to overcome limitations of single-marker analyses. Sepsis prognostic models were dominated by clinical variables with genetic markers less informative. In contrast, evidence for gene-gene interactions were identified for sepsis treatment responses with genetic biomarkers dominating models for predicting therapeutic responses, yielding candidates for replication in other cohorts.	
22318345	A genome-wide association study identifies SNP in DCC is associated with gallbladder cancer in the Japanese population.	Gallbladder cancer (GC) is a relatively uncommon cancer with higher incidence in certain areas including Japan. Because of the difficulty in diagnosis, prognosis of GC is very poor. To identify genetic determinants of GC, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 41 GC patients and 866 controls. Association between each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with GC susceptibility was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis conditioned on age and gender of subjects. SNPs that showed suggestive association (P<1 × 10(-4)) with GC were further examined in 30 cases and 898 controls. SNP rs7504990 in the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer, 18q21.3) that encodes a netrin 1 receptor achieved a combined P-value of 7.46 × 10(-8) (OR=6.95; 95% CI=3.43-14.08). Subsequent imputation analysis identified multiple SNPs with similarly strong associations in an adjacent genomic region, where loss of heterozygosity was reported in GC and other cancers. Reduced expression of DCC was indicated to be associated with the poorly differentiated histological type, increased proliferation and metastasis through loss of adhesiveness. However, due to the limited sample size investigated here, further replication study and functional analysis would be necessary to further confirm the result of the association.	
22322875	Genetic association of short sleep duration with hypertension incidence--a 6-year follow-up in the Korean genome and epidemiology study.	Hypertension (HT) is caused by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Despite evidence for an association between short sleep duration and the development of HT, genetic factors associated with this effect have not been defined. Here we prospectively investigated the incidence of HT in subjects with short sleep duration over a 6-year follow-up period, and identified associated genetic variants in a genome-wide association study.	
22327514	Common variants near TARDBP and EGR2 are associated with susceptibility to Ewing sarcoma.	Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric tumor characterized by EWSR1-ETS fusions, is predominantly observed in populations of European ancestry. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 401 French individuals with Ewing sarcoma, 684 unaffected French individuals and 3,668 unaffected individuals of European descent and living in the United States. We identified candidate risk loci at 1p36.22, 10q21 and 15q15. We replicated these loci in two independent sets of cases and controls. Joint analysis identified associations with rs9430161 (P = 1.4 × 10(-20); odds ratio (OR) = 2.2) located 25 kb upstream of TARDBP, rs224278 (P = 4.0 × 10(-17); OR = 1.7) located 5 kb upstream of EGR2 and, to a lesser extent, rs4924410 at 15q15 (P = 6.6 × 10(-9); OR = 1.5). The major risk haplotypes were less prevalent in Africans, suggesting that these loci could contribute to geographical differences in Ewing sarcoma incidence. TARDBP shares structural similarities with EWSR1 and FUS, which encode RNA binding proteins, and EGR2 is a target gene of EWSR1-ETS. Variants at these loci were associated with expression levels of TARDBP, ADO (encoding cysteamine dioxygenase) and EGR2.	 20400460 18974171 16856148 14136345 21212061 18463370 7935840 7903221 4192117 20660762 17581819 9466118 17529973 21086759 15297300 17401363 4191272 20716776 19144156 8565822 17293876 21678065 20543858 17701901 17482132 20351326 6104072 11672775 1522903 17973254 6704922 18256529 19548262
22331829	Genetic determinants of statin-induced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction: the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial.	In statin trials, each 20 mg/dL reduction in cholesterol results in a 10-15% reduction of annual incidence rates for vascular events. However, interindividual variation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response to statins is wide and may partially be determined on a genetic basis.	
22342860	A common variant near the KCNJ2 gene is associated with T-peak to T-end interval.

The genetic factors affecting the TPE interval are largely unknown.	 11371347 21836130 11699519 12109867 12398982 12417545 15037560 8901825 9535495 9793090 9799215 15761194 16723781 17372189 17762661 18091743 18804787 19160088 19019189 19305408 19305409 19643915 20400777 20215044 20810666 21511878 21593198 21685173 11593111
22343285	Association of common genetic variants in GPCPD1 with scaling of visual cortical surface area in humans.	Visual cortical surface area varies two- to threefold between human individuals, is highly heritable, and has been correlated with visual acuity and visual perception. However, it is still largely unknown what specific genetic and environmental factors contribute to normal variation in the area of visual cortex. To identify SNPs associated with the proportional surface area of visual cortex, we performed a genome-wide association study followed by replication in two independent cohorts. We identified one SNP (rs6116869) that replicated in both cohorts and had genome-wide significant association (P(combined) = 3.2 × 10(-8)). Furthermore, a metaanalysis of imputed SNPs in this genomic region identified a more significantly associated SNP (rs238295; P = 6.5 × 10(-9)) that was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs6116869. These SNPs are located within 4 kb of the 5' UTR of GPCPD1, glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase GDE1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which in humans, is more highly expressed in occipital cortex compared with the remainder of cortex than 99.9% of genes genome-wide. Based on these findings, we conclude that this common genetic variation contributes to the proportional area of human visual cortex. We suggest that identifying genes that contribute to normal cortical architecture provides a first step to understanding genetic mechanisms that underlie visual perception.	 17151600 17053076 17506092 17701901 17964244 18250320 18409201 18852200 18973570 18974171 19328238 19717458 19299253 20080800 20112130 20172590 20609836 20185149 20451256 20576599 20881960 20890293 21131954 21562281 21572413 21127014 10764649 10619420 21378112 10890446 10966694 11268211 11431688 22099457 11532887 11855950 11950766 12731001 12765616 14640882 15102918 6772266 3291116 7777856 7652574 8528262 9092607 9359037 9595970 9697698 9931268 10511641 15774010 16862161 17073977 17360492
22341974	Genome-wide association study of three-dimensional facial morphology identifies a variant in PAX3 associated with nasion position.	Craniofacial morphology is highly heritable, but little is known about which genetic variants influence normal facial variation in the general population. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with normal facial variation in a population-based cohort of 15-year-olds from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. 3D high-resolution images were obtained with two laser scanners, these were merged and aligned, and 22 landmarks were identified and their x, y, and z coordinates used to generate 54 3D distances reflecting facial features. 14 principal components (PCs) were also generated from the landmark locations. We carried out genome-wide association analyses of these distances and PCs in 2,185 adolescents and attempted to replicate any significant associations in a further 1,622 participants. In the discovery analysis no associations were observed with the PCs, but we identified four associations with the distances, and one of these, the association between rs7559271 in PAX3 and the nasion to midendocanthion distance (n-men), was replicated (p = 4 × 10(-7)). In a combined analysis, each G allele of rs7559271 was associated with an increase in n-men distance of 0.39 mm (p = 4 × 10(-16)), explaining 1.3% of the variance. Independent associations were observed in both the z (nasion prominence) and y (nasion height) dimensions (p = 9 × 10(-9) and p = 9 × 10(-10), respectively), suggesting that the locus primarily influences growth in the yz plane. Rare variants in PAX3 are known to cause Waardenburg syndrome, which involves deafness, pigmentary abnormalities, and facial characteristics including a broad nasal bridge. Our findings show that common variants within this gene also influence normal craniofacial development.	 21934112 19154273 16214622 15750539 14902764 9308261 1303207 4512074 5269761 11237119 18037656 18757921 18685568 19061801 21694738 21458441 21254217 21058334 20697423 20381762 20127975 19537876 9279758
22359512	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with circulating phospho- and sphingolipid concentrations.	Phospho- and sphingolipids are crucial cellular and intracellular compounds. These lipids are required for active transport, a number of enzymatic processes, membrane formation, and cell signalling. Disruption of their metabolism leads to several diseases, with diverse neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic consequences. A large number of phospholipid and sphingolipid species can be detected and measured in human plasma. We conducted a meta-analysis of five European family-based genome-wide association studies (N = 4034) on plasma levels of 24 sphingomyelins (SPM), 9 ceramides (CER), 57 phosphatidylcholines (PC), 20 lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), 27 phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and 16 PE-based plasmalogens (PLPE), as well as their proportions in each major class. This effort yielded 25 genome-wide significant loci for phospholipids (smallest P-value = 9.88×10(-204)) and 10 loci for sphingolipids (smallest P-value = 3.10×10(-57)). After a correction for multiple comparisons (P-value<2.2×10(-9)), we observed four novel loci significantly associated with phospholipids (PAQR9, AGPAT1, PKD2L1, PDXDC1) and two with sphingolipids (PLD2 and APOE) explaining up to 3.1% of the variance. Further analysis of the top findings with respect to within class molar proportions uncovered three additional loci for phospholipids (PNLIPRP2, PCDH20, and ABDH3) suggesting their involvement in either fatty acid elongation/saturation processes or fatty acid specific turnover mechanisms. Among those, 14 loci (KCNH7, AGPAT1, PNLIPRP2, SYT9, FADS1-2-3, DLG2, APOA1, ELOVL2, CDK17, LIPC, PDXDC1, PLD2, LASS4, and APOE) mapped into the glycerophospholipid and 12 loci (ILKAP, ITGA9, AGPAT1, FADS1-2-3, APOA1, PCDH20, LIPC, PDXDC1, SGPP1, APOE, LASS4, and PLD2) to the sphingolipid pathways. In large meta-analyses, associations between FADS1-2-3 and carotid intima media thickness, AGPAT1 and type 2 diabetes, and APOA1 and coronary artery disease were observed. In conclusion, our study identified nine novel phospho- and sphingolipid loci, substantially increasing our knowledge of the genetic basis for these traits.	 9122196 15522827 19043545 12816776 16044242 17384015 17052686 21909108 18320251 20686565 19089453 20581827 17612623 19615119 20616382 21378990 10878232 18216768 8645158 11581500 16118212 9461603 6294659 21058334 7926813 20037589 21873553 19398762 1276478 18356547 1379598 17148553 19798445 15134513 17616780 12446479 18220755 18940869
22344219	Meta-analysis identifies common variants associated with body mass index in east Asians.	Multiple genetic loci associated with obesity or body mass index (BMI) have been identified through genome-wide association studies conducted predominantly in populations of European ancestry. We performed a meta-analysis of associations between BMI and approximately 2.4 million SNPs in 27,715 east Asians, which was followed by in silico and de novo replication studies in 37,691 and 17,642 additional east Asians, respectively. We identified ten BMI-associated loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)), including seven previously identified loci (FTO, SEC16B, MC4R, GIPR-QPCTL, ADCY3-DNAJC27, BDNF and MAP2K5) and three novel loci in or near the CDKAL1, PCSK1 and GP2 genes. Three additional loci nearly reached the genome-wide significance threshold, including two previously identified loci in the GNPDA2 and TFAP2B genes and a newly identified signal near PAX6, all of which were associated with BMI with P < 5.0 × 10(-7). Findings from this study may shed light on new pathways involved in obesity and demonstrate the value of conducting genetic studies in non-European populations.	 17434869 22344221 17943122 17658951 18454146 18454148 18604207 18846210 18852200 19079260 19079261 19151714 20935630 19396169 20562874 20421936 20220756 19933162 19417063 21142536 20959295 19207020 20702402 20460429 20581827 16418744 15472203 14726171 12202775 12164465 11315092 10592259 17460697 17463249
22344221	Common variants at CDKAL1 and KLF9 are associated with body mass index in east Asian populations.	Obesity is a disorder with a complex genetic etiology, and its epidemic is a worldwide problem. Although multiple genetic loci associated with body mass index, the most common measure of obesity, have been identified in European populations, few studies have focused on Asian populations. Here we report a genome-wide association study and replication studies with 62,245 east Asian subjects, which identified two new body mass index-associated loci in the CDKAL1 locus at 6p22 (rs2206734, P = 1.4 × 10(-11)) and the KLF9 locus at 9q21 (rs11142387, P = 1.3 × 10(-9)), as well as several previously reported loci (the SEC16B, BDNF, FTO, MC4R and GIPR loci, P < 5.0 × 10(-8)). We subsequently performed gene-gene interaction analyses and identified an interaction (P = 2.0 × 10(-8)) between a SNP in the KLF9 locus (rs11142387) and one in the MSTN (also known as GDF8) locus at 2q32 (rs13034723). These findings should provide useful insights into the etiology of obesity.	 20052486 19396169 19434077 20190380 20127379 20490451 20460429 20818381 20935630 20725087 21196492 22344219 10581882 10766250 11315092 12164465 14685227 14726171 15052270 15215484 9519560 15897298 16054042 15925952 17434869 17460697 17873874 17982410 18454146 18454148 18325910 18817904 19079260 19079261 19151714 19268274 19147600 20081857

22365631	Genome-wide association study of temperament in bipolar disorder reveals significant associations with three novel Loci.	The many attempts to identify genes for bipolar disorder (BD) have met with limited success, which has generally been attributed to genetic heterogeneity and small gene effects. However, it is also possible that the categorical phenotypes used in genetic studies of BD are not the most informative or biologically relevant. Although quantitative phenotypes provide an alternative to categorical phenotypes based on diagnosis, they have not been fully exploited in BD genetics due to the lack of accessible biological measures. We have explored aspects of temperament as quantitative phenotypes that might define subtypes of BD with different clinical features and courses of illness. Temperament is a heritable personality factor that establishes the baseline level of reactivity, mood, and energy of a person.	 7125846 3829791 4037989 4078756 2602525 2269669 1417435 1447430 8179460 7944874 7653337 9106159 9476738 9858076 15780683 15780684 15780685 15780686 10743853 11238726 11149935 11814388 11986984 12507751 12668356 12808435 14595443 910973 9879799 15780671 15780675 15780676 15780678 15780679 16224024 16239144 17306377 17701901 17667963 18762592 18826446 18711365 19488044 19809321 18957941 20424505 20634892 20691247 20129674 6872538
22497812	Interleukin 28B polymorphisms are the only common genetic variants associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in genotype-1 chronic hepatitis C and determine the association between LDL-C and treatment response.	Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and interleukin 28B (IL28B) polymorphism are associated with sustained viral response (SVR) to peginterferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. IL28B has been linked with LDL-C levels using a candidate gene approach, but it is not known whether other genetic variants are associated with LDL-C, nor how these factors definitively affect SVR. We assessed genetic predictors of serum lipid and triglyceride levels in 1604 patients with genotype 1 (G1) chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by genome-wide association study and developed multivariable predictive models of SVR. IL28B polymorphisms were the only common genetic variants associated with pretreatment LDL-C level in Caucasians (rs12980275, P = 4.7 × 10(-17), poor response IL28B variants associated with lower LDL-C). The association was dependent on HCV infection, IL28B genotype was no longer associated with LDL-C in SVR patients after treatment, while the association remained significant in non-SVR patients (P < 0.001). LDL-C was significantly associated with SVR for heterozygous IL28B genotype patients (P < 0.001) but not for homozygous genotypes. SVR modelling suggested that IL28B heterozygotes with LDL-C > 130 mg/dL and HCV RNA ≤600 000 IU/mL may anticipate cure rates >80%, while the absence of these two criteria was associated with an SVR rate of <35%. IL28B polymorphisms are the only common genetic variants associated with pretreatment LDL-C in G1-HCV. LDL-C remains significantly associated with SVR for heterozygous IL28B genotype patients, where LDL-C and HCV RNA burden may identify those patients with high or low likelihood of cure with pegIFN/RBV therapy.	 10535997 21236304 11588264 12829989 2586614 9185775 16862161 16704979 16941688 17234812 17701901 17721513 18077707 18467494 19625712 19749758 19787818 19854061 19900446 20173735 20235331 20434452 20568303 20690192 21703198 19621337 19684573 19749757 20931559 21111740 11322205
22383897	Genome-wide association study in east Asians identifies novel susceptibility loci for breast cancer.	Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. We aimed to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, we evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls. Ninety-four SNPs were further evaluated in 5,203 cases and 5,138 controls, and finally the top 22 SNPs were investigated in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls). SNP rs9485372, near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10(-12) in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. SNP rs9383951 (P = 1.9×10(-6) from the combined analysis of all samples), located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, and SNP rs7107217 (P = 4.6×10(-7)), located at 11q24.3, also showed a consistent association in each of the four stages. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, near the TAB2 gene (6q25.1), and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively.	 18974064 19219042 18326623 19789366 21263130 16862161 20932475 20414203 19330027 18438407 17529967 20484103 15050954 19031103 21497495 10861490 19330030 16636675 11585719 17529974 17529973 20585626 20699374 18845558 21552322 20852631 11329055 20453838 11057897 16259637 12718640 19396169 20661439 18629629 21514219 10695593
22383894	Genome-wide association study identifies chromosome 10q24.32 variants associated with arsenic metabolism and toxicity phenotypes in Bangladesh.	Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a major public health issue in many countries, increasing risk for a wide array of diseases, including cancer. There is inter-individual variation in arsenic metabolism efficiency and susceptibility to arsenic toxicity; however, the basis of this variation is not well understood. Here, we have performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of arsenic-related metabolism and toxicity phenotypes to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which arsenic affects health. Using data on urinary arsenic metabolite concentrations and approximately 300,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 1,313 arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi individuals, we identified genome-wide significant association signals (P<5×10(-8)) for percentages of both monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) near the AS3MT gene (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32), with five genetic variants showing independent associations. In a follow-up analysis of 1,085 individuals with arsenic-induced premalignant skin lesions (the classical sign of arsenic toxicity) and 1,794 controls, we show that one of these five variants (rs9527) is also associated with skin lesion risk (P = 0.0005). Using a subset of individuals with prospectively measured arsenic (n = 769), we show that rs9527 interacts with arsenic to influence incident skin lesion risk (P = 0.01). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of genome-wide expression data from 950 individual's lymphocyte RNA suggest that several of our lead SNPs represent cis-eQTLs for AS3MT (P = 10(-12)) and neighboring gene C10orf32 (P = 10(-44)), which are involved in C10orf32-AS3MT read-through transcription. This is the largest and most comprehensive genomic investigation of arsenic metabolism and toxicity to date, the only GWAS of any arsenic-related trait, and the first study to implicate 10q24.32 variants in both arsenic metabolism and arsenical skin lesion risk. The observed patterns of associations suggest that MMA% and DMA% have distinct genetic determinants and support the hypothesis that DMA is the less toxic of these two methylated arsenic species. These results have potential translational implications for the prevention and treatment of arsenic-associated toxicities worldwide.	 17701901 17589600 17900556 18272166 18336856 18681785 18566022 18511031 18783726 19015167 19371612 19543409 18682255 19417063 19797964 19680750 19850625 20010213 20147036 20137780 20208533 20014157 20532380 20587388 20646756 20547570 20634204 20621156 21058334 20571777 21247820 21397062 21378128 21731446 21576319 11019458 12117651 15371236 1893592 1419632 15541756 15721893 15743710 16217243 16160703 16407288 16624965 16862161 16807664 17548696 18025055
22367966	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with serum level of vitamin B12 in Chinese men.	Vitamin B12 (VitB12 or cobalamin) is an essential cofactor in several metabolic pathways. Clinically, VitB12 deficiency is associated with pernicious anemia, neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal disease. Although previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several genes, including FUT2, CUBN, TCN1 and MUT, that may influence VitB12 levels in European populations, common genetic determinants of VitB12 remain largely unknown, especially in Asian populations. Here we performed a GWAS in 1999 healthy Chinese men and replicated the top findings in an independent Chinese sample with 1496 subjects. We identified four novel genomic loci that were significantly associated with serum level of VitB12 at a genome-wide significance level of 5.00 × 10(-8). These four loci were MS4A3 (11q12.1; rs2298585; P= 2.64 × 10(-15)), CLYBL (13q32; rs41281112; P= 9.23 × 10(-10)), FUT6 (19p13.3; rs3760776; P= 3.68 × 10(-13)) and 5q32 region (rs10515552; P= 3.94 × 10(-8)). In addition, we also confirmed the association with the serum level of VitB12 for the previously reported FUT2 gene and identified one novel non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in FUT2 gene in this Chinese population (19q13.33; rs1047781; P= 3.62 × 10(-36)). The new loci identified offer new insights into the biochemical pathways involved in determining the serum level of VitB12 and provide opportunities to better delineate the role of VitB12 in health and disease.	
22368281	Genome-wide association study of genetic determinants of LDL-c response to atorvastatin therapy: importance of Lp(a).	We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of LDL-c response to statin using data from participants in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS; n = 1,156), the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT; n = 895), and the observational phase of ASCOT (n = 651), all of whom were prescribed atorvastatin 10 mg. Following genome-wide imputation, we combined data from the three studies in a meta-analysis. We found associations of LDL-c response to atorvastatin that reached genome-wide significance at rs10455872 (P = 6.13 × 10(-9)) within the LPA gene and at two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the APOE region (rs445925; P = 2.22 × 10(-16) and rs4420638; P = 1.01 × 10(-11)) that are proxies for the ε2 and ε4 variants, respectively, in APOE. The novel association with the LPA SNP was replicated in the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial (P = 0.009). Using CARDS data, we further showed that atorvastatin therapy did not alter lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and that Lp(a) levels accounted for all of the associations of SNPs in the LPA gene and the apparent LDL-c response levels. However, statin therapy had a similar effect in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients in the top quartile for serum Lp(a) levels (HR = 0.60) compared with those in the lower three quartiles (HR = 0.66; P = 0.8 for interaction). The data emphasize that high Lp(a) levels affect the measurement of LDL-c and the clinical estimation of LDL-c response. Therefore, an apparently lower LDL-c response to statin therapy may indicate a need for measurement of Lp(a). However, statin therapy seems beneficial even in those with high Lp(a).	 18222353 8640397 18815589 16103896 16862161 17572673 17194218 17701901 19079261 19557161 19622820 19715440 19891551 20031582 20032323 20160194 20339536 20233392 20413733 20498921 20838585 20965889 20543033 21500721 21478162 21592478 21977987 10569329 12056584 12686036 14578310 15200443 15325833 4337382 8149612 7806965 18334912
22384028	A genome-wide linkage and association scan reveals novel loci for hypertension and blood pressure traits.	Hypertension is caused by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. The condition which is very common, with about 18% of the adult Hong Kong Chinese population and over 50% of older individuals affected, is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. To identify genes influencing hypertension and blood pressure, we conducted a combined linkage and association study using over 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 328 individuals comprising 111 hypertensive probands and their siblings. Using a family-based association test, we found an association with SNPs on chromosome 5q31.1 (rs6596140; P<9 × 10(-8)) for hypertension. One candidate gene, PDC, was replicated, with rs3817586 on 1q31.1 attaining P = 2.5 × 10(-4) and 2.9 × 10(-5) in the within-family tests for DBP and MAP, respectively. We also identified regions of significant linkage for systolic and diastolic blood pressure on chromosomes 2q22 and 5p13, respectively. Further family-based association analysis of the linkage peak on chromosome 5 yielded a significant association (rs1605685, P<7 × 10(-5)) for DBP. This is the first combined linkage and association study of hypertension and its related quantitative traits with Chinese ancestry. The associations reported here account for the action of common variants whereas the discovery of linkage regions may point to novel targets for rare variant screening.	 10631157 15652604 19023099 15106785 11105397 16862161 11010968 16636198 17130344 18466507 19959875 12650940 11040222 19609347 17033627 9797185 8288249 12719445 19927152 10513834 10322434 1319556 19430479 16252236 16754790 11243726 15939106 12761042 17485599 8898209 19114657 19421330 17381490 17554300 19812666 19430483 11204305 15003293 20877124 17701901 11082146 19396169 15240345 9915965 12559685 20216084 12559686 12111667 16543358 11600185 20414254

22396660	A genome-wide association study of nephrolithiasis in the Japanese population identifies novel susceptible Loci at 5q35.3, 7p14.3, and 13q14.1.	Nephrolithiasis is a common nephrologic disorder with complex etiology. To identify the genetic factor(s) for nephrolithiasis, we conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a total of 5,892 nephrolithiasis cases and 17,809 controls of Japanese origin. Here we found three novel loci for nephrolithiasis: RGS14-SLC34A1-PFN3-F12 on 5q35.3 (rs11746443; P = 8.51×10⁻¹², odds ratio (OR) = 1.19), INMT-FAM188B-AQP1 on 7p14.3 (rs1000597; P = 2.16×10⁻¹⁴, OR = 1.22), and DGKH on 13q14.1 (rs4142110; P = 4.62×10⁻⁹, OR = 1.14). Subsequent analyses in 21,842 Japanese subjects revealed the association of SNP rs11746443 with the reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 6.54×10⁻⁸), suggesting a crucial role for this variation in renal function. Our findings elucidated the significance of genetic variations for the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis.	 20139978 19940772 20558539 21738478 21161648 10571800 10720863 11168684 12324554 12824369 3329634 2674489 9335385 9468475 9560283 15297300 15671430 15698445 16200192 17463248 17701901 17982410 18408483 18398418 18348202 18817904 19339088 19417063 19561606 19358880 19879194 19321253 20383146

22387998	A genome-wide association study identifies two susceptibility loci for duodenal ulcer in the Japanese population.	Through a genome-wide association analysis with a total of 7,035 individuals with duodenal ulcer and 25,323 controls from Japan, we identified two susceptibility loci at the PSCA gene (encoding prostate stem cell antigen) at 8q24 and at the ABO blood group locus at 9q34. The C allele of rs2294008 at PSCA was associated with increased risk of duodenal ulcer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.84; P = 3.92 × 10(-33)) in a recessive model but was associated with decreased risk of gastric cancer (OR = 0.79; P = 6.79 × 10(-12)), as reported previously. The T allele of rs2294008 encodes a translation initiation codon upstream of the reported site and changes protein localization from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. rs505922 at ABO was also associated with duodenal ulcer in a recessive model (OR = 1.32; P = 1.15 × 10(-10)). Our findings demonstrate a role for genetic variants in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer.	 3989441 8016569 15273394 17982410 2788113 2464874 11511555 12718687 19843866 21306478 104072 13240206 2333095 18838214 3329634 21680535 18488030 8613015 20501618 8657240 16239542 14696402 15297300 16230414 8730266 20937632 21239051 17463248 19648920 12918114 10713670 1478671 16847081 19648918 20139978 17701901 3654985 20374648 3721287 9554675 8189011
22403646	A genome-wide association study identifies rs2000999 as a strong genetic determinant of circulating haptoglobin levels.	Haptoglobin is an acute phase inflammatory marker. Its main function is to bind hemoglobin released from erythrocytes to aid its elimination, and thereby haptoglobin prevents the generation of reactive oxygen species in the blood. Haptoglobin levels have been repeatedly associated with a variety of inflammation-linked infectious and non-infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, diabetes, carotid atherosclerosis, and acute myocardial infarction. However, a comprehensive genetic assessment of the inter-individual variability of circulating haptoglobin levels has not been conducted so far.We used a genome-wide association study initially conducted in 631 French children followed by a replication in three additional European sample sets and we identified a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2000999 located in the Haptoglobin gene (HP) as a strong genetic predictor of circulating Haptoglobin levels (P(overall) = 8.1 × 10(-59)), explaining 45.4% of its genetic variability (11.8% of Hp global variance). The functional relevance of rs2000999 was further demonstrated by its specific association with HP mRNA levels (β = 0.23 ± 0.08, P = 0.007). Finally, SNP rs2000999 was associated with decreased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 8,789 European children (P(total cholesterol) = 0.002 and P(LDL) = 0.0008).Given the central position of haptoglobin in many inflammation-related metabolic pathways, the relevance of rs2000999 genotyping when evaluating haptoglobin concentration should be further investigated in order to improve its diagnostic/therapeutic and/or prevention impact.	 15469638 12750308 952492 7246523 6751044 2987228 3061869 1855495 8349072 8524762 8557894 8831057 8836895 8855140 9074811 9246691 9463309 9662199 9804392 9971870 10217368 15662028 15811985 16630378 17305644 17378724 17701901 18440326 18480203 18451265 18601594 18486167 19060909 19275893 19567439 19496732 19457062 20066028 20064496 20521439 20686565 19657769 20843515 14600186 15102756 10778655 11012324 11138611 11389553 11564959 12194911 12792358 4337382
22399527	Genome-wide screen for metabolic syndrome susceptibility Loci reveals strong lipid gene contribution but no evidence for common genetic basis for clustering of metabolic syndrome traits.	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified several susceptibility loci for metabolic syndrome (MetS) component traits, but have had variable success in identifying susceptibility loci to the syndrome as an entity. We conducted a GWA study on MetS and its component traits in 4 Finnish cohorts consisting of 2637 MetS cases and 7927 controls, both free of diabetes, and followed the top loci in an independent sample with transcriptome and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomics data. Furthermore, we tested for loci associated with multiple MetS component traits using factor analysis, and built a genetic risk score for MetS.	 15836891 18445357 17624514 17384015 9851757 19715440 20694148 19424496 17727697 21386085 19502414 16182882 21129047 18853134 20406164 18454146 18758442 20233392 17332787 8079995 21058334 20037589 17701901 19959603 19060906 18678614 17404171 17416293 16806226 20017981 20081858 18008060 9267993
22399142	A genome-wide association study identifies novel susceptibility genetic variation for thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis.	Several lines of evidence have pointed out that genetic components have roles in thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TTPP). In this study, for the first time we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) in male hyperthyroid subjects in order to identify genetic loci conferring susceptibility to TTPP. We genotyped 78 Thai male TTPP cases and 74 Thai male hyperthyroid patients without hypokalemia as controls with Illumina Human-Hap610 Genotyping BeadChip. Among the SNPs analyzed in the GWAS, rs312729 at chromosome 17q revealed the lowest P-value for association (P=2.09 × 10(-7)). After fine mapping for linkage disequilibrium blocks surrounding the landmark SNP, we found a significant association of rs623011; located at 75 kb downstream of KCNJ2 on chromosome 17q, reached the GWAS significance after Bonferroni's adjustment (P=3.23 × 10(-8), odds ratio (OR)=6.72; 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.11-14.5). The result was confirmed in an independent cohort of samples consisting of 28 TTPP patients and 48 controls using the same clinical criteria diagnosis (replication analysis P=3.44 × 10(-5), OR=5.13; 95% CI=1.87-14.1; combined-analysis P=3.71 × 10(-12), OR=5.47; 95% CI=3.04-9.83).	
22423221	A meta-analysis and genome-wide association study of platelet count and mean platelet volume in african americans.	Several genetic variants associated with platelet count and mean platelet volume (MPV) were recently reported in people of European ancestry. In this meta-analysis of 7 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enrolling African Americans, our aim was to identify novel genetic variants associated with platelet count and MPV. For all cohorts, GWAS analysis was performed using additive models after adjusting for age, sex, and population stratification. For both platelet phenotypes, meta-analyses were conducted using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect models. Platelet aggregation assays in whole blood were performed in the participants of the GeneSTAR cohort. Genetic variants in ten independent regions were associated with platelet count (N = 16,388) with p<5×10(-8) of which 5 have not been associated with platelet count in previous GWAS. The novel genetic variants associated with platelet count were in the following regions (the most significant SNP, closest gene, and p-value): 6p22 (rs12526480, LRRC16A, p = 9.1×10(-9)), 7q11 (rs13236689, CD36, p = 2.8×10(-9)), 10q21 (rs7896518, JMJD1C, p = 2.3×10(-12)), 11q13 (rs477895, BAD, p = 4.9×10(-8)), and 20q13 (rs151361, SLMO2, p = 9.4×10(-9)). Three of these loci (10q21, 11q13, and 20q13) were replicated in European Americans (N = 14,909) and one (11q13) in Hispanic Americans (N = 3,462). For MPV (N = 4,531), genetic variants in 3 regions were significant at p<5×10(-8), two of which were also associated with platelet count. Previously reported regions that were also significant in this study were 6p21, 6q23, 7q22, 12q24, and 19p13 for platelet count and 7q22, 17q11, and 19p13 for MPV. The most significant SNP in 1 region was also associated with ADP-induced maximal platelet aggregation in whole blood (12q24). Thus through a meta-analysis of GWAS enrolling African Americans, we have identified 5 novel regions associated with platelet count of which 3 were replicated in other ethnic groups. In addition, we also found one region associated with platelet aggregation that may play a potential role in atherothrombosis.	 20823129 21104887 20942852 21253569 21283782 21153663 21347282 21478428 21909108 21909110 10723803 10744157 11921445 12149212 12586623 4537519 8229103 10449696 15566912 15767524 15705797 16054028 15955831 16246584 16434392 17074729 17382885 17353003 17170127 17437727 17417629 17488662 17663734 17701901 18077812 18179887 18195081 17900936 18435972 18510698 18940312 19084217 19110211 18849486 19221038 19228925 19471024 19503597 19641507 19429868 19847309 19820697 19853236 19936222 20040588 19691485 20139978 20574069 20526338 20616382 20530532 21058334 21129717
22412388	A genome-wide scan of Ashkenazi Jewish Crohn's disease suggests novel susceptibility loci.	Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association to date identified 71 CD-susceptibility loci in individuals of European ancestry. An important epidemiological feature of CD is that it is 2-4 times more prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent compared to non-Jewish Europeans (NJ). To explore genetic variation associated with CD in AJs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by combining raw genotype data across 10 AJ cohorts consisting of 907 cases and 2,345 controls in the discovery stage, followed up by a replication study in 971 cases and 2,124 controls. We confirmed genome-wide significant associations of 9 known CD loci in AJs and replicated 3 additional loci with strong signal (p<5×10⁻⁶). Novel signals detected among AJs were mapped to chromosomes 5q21.1 (rs7705924, combined p = 2×10⁻⁸; combined odds ratio OR = 1.48), 2p15 (rs6545946, p = 7×10⁻⁹; OR = 1.16), 8q21.11 (rs12677663, p = 2×10⁻⁸; OR = 1.15), 10q26.3 (rs10734105, p = 3×10⁻⁸; OR = 1.27), and 11q12.1 (rs11229030, p = 8×10⁻⁹; OR = 1.15), implicating biologically plausible candidate genes, including RPL7, CPAMD8, PRG2, and PRG3. In all, the 16 replicated and newly discovered loci, in addition to the three coding NOD2 variants, accounted for 11.2% of the total genetic variance for CD risk in the AJ population. This study demonstrates the complementary value of genetic studies in the Ashkenazim.	 10770291 21548950 10913121 11315092 11485571 11715044 12499305 12612865 14740294 15177561 2178530 2333511 1953909 1565101 8491401 7750987 9612272 10069410 16862161 17068223 17435756 17447842 17554300 17554261 17684544 17701901 17873877 17903301 17983810 18159056 18208327 18326623 18483404 18587394 18676988 19161619 19820697 19756366 19923578 19697356 19844264 20208533 19812545 20560205 20531471 20616382 21102463 10866211

22417934	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic loci associated with body mass index and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels during psychopharmacological treatment - a cross-sectional naturalistic study.	Metabolic and cardiovascular side effects are serious clinical problems related to psychopharmacological treatment, but the underlying mechanisms are mostly unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors during pharmacological therapy. Twelve indicators of metabolic side effects as well as cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed in a naturalistic sample of 594 patients of Norwegian ancestry. We analyzed interactions between gene variants and three categories of psychopharmacological agents based on their reported potential for side effects. For body mass index (BMI), two significantly associated loci were identified on 8q21.3. There were seven markers in one 30-kb region, and the strongest signal was rs7838490. In another locus 140kb away, six markers were significant, and rs6989402 obtained the strongest signal. Both of these loci are located upstream of the gene matrix metalloproteinase 16 (MMP16). For high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), marker rs11615274 on 12q21 was significant. The results highlight three genomic regions potentially harboring susceptibility genes for drug-induced metabolic side effects, identifying MMP16 as a candidate gene. This deserves to be replicated in additional populations to provide more evidence for molecular genetic mechanisms of side effects during psychopharmacological treatment.	
22419666	Genome wide study of maternal and parent-of-origin effects on the etiology of orofacial clefts.	We performed a genome wide association analysis of maternally-mediated genetic effects and parent-of-origin (POO) effects on risk of orofacial clefting (OC) using over 2,000 case-parent triads collected through an international cleft consortium. We used log-linear regression models to test individual SNPs. For SNPs with a P-value <10(-5) for maternal genotypic effects, we also applied a haplotype-based method, TRIMM, to extract potential information from clusters of correlated SNPs. None of the SNPs were significant at the genome wide level. Our results suggest neither maternal genome nor POO effects play major roles in the etiology of OC in our sample. This finding is consistent with previous genetic studies and recent population-based cohort studies in Norway and Denmark, which showed no apparent difference between mother-to-offspring and father-to-offspring recurrence of clefting. We, however, cannot completely rule out maternal genome or POO effects as risk factors because very small effects might not be detectable with our sample size, they may influence risk through interactions with environmental exposures or may act through a more complex network of interacting genes. Thus, the most promising SNPs identified by this study may still be worth further investigation.	 21331089 21319277 12163415 15185170 15317890 15386475 4823025 930925 8213835 9529360 9801020 15716346 15936012 16007597 17273975 17564963 18250102 18319078 18480962 18357615 18688869 18836445 19249007 19048631 19252488 19270707 19142206 19521098 19444471 19656524 19752161 20436469 20634891 10631165
22425255	A genome-wide search for genetic influences and biological pathways related to the brain's white matter integrity.	A genome-wide search for genetic variants influencing the brain's white matter integrity in old age was conducted in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936). At ∼73 years of age, members of the LBC1936 underwent diffusion MRI, from which 12 white matter tracts were segmented using quantitative tractography, and tract-averaged water diffusion parameters were determined (n = 668). A global measure of white matter tract integrity, g(FA), derived from principal components analysis of tract-averaged fractional anisotropy measurements, accounted for 38.6% of the individual differences across the 12 white matter tracts. A genome-wide search was performed with g(FA) on 535 individuals with 542,050 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). No single SNP association was genome-wide significant (all p > 5 × 10(-8)). There was genome-wide suggestive evidence for two SNPs, one in ADAMTS18 (p = 1.65 × 10(-6)), which is related to tumor suppression and hemostasis, and another in LOC388630 (p = 5.08 × 10(-6)), which is of unknown function. Although no gene passed correction for multiple comparisons in single gene-based testing, biological pathways analysis suggested evidence for an over-representation of neuronal transmission and cell adhesion pathways relating to g(FA).

22438815	Comprehensive research synopsis and systematic meta-analyses in Parkinson's disease genetics: The PDGene database.	More than 800 published genetic association studies have implicated dozens of potential risk loci in Parkinson's disease (PD). To facilitate the interpretation of these findings, we have created a dedicated online resource, PDGene, that comprehensively collects and meta-analyzes all published studies in the field. A systematic literature screen of -27,000 articles yielded 828 eligible articles from which relevant data were extracted. In addition, individual-level data from three publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were obtained and subjected to genotype imputation and analysis. Overall, we performed meta-analyses on more than seven million polymorphisms originating either from GWAS datasets and/or from smaller scale PD association studies. Meta-analyses on 147 SNPs were supplemented by unpublished GWAS data from up to 16,452 PD cases and 48,810 controls. Eleven loci showed genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)) association with disease risk: BST1, CCDC62/HIP1R, DGKQ/GAK, GBA, LRRK2, MAPT, MCCC1/LAMP3, PARK16, SNCA, STK39, and SYT11/RAB25. In addition, we identified novel evidence for genome-wide significant association with a polymorphism in ITGA8 (rs7077361, OR 0.88, P  =  1.3 × 10(-8)). All meta-analysis results are freely available on a dedicated online database (www.pdgene.org), which is cross-linked with a customized track on the UCSC Genome Browser. Our study provides an exhaustive and up-to-date summary of the status of PD genetics research that can be readily scaled to include the results of future large-scale genetics projects, including next-generation sequencing studies.	 18985386 19419854 19343804 21907011 18583979 16896109 16345038 7541634 3802833 21763482 19915575 17332845 17898028 17683088 19915576 21763483 16252231 20711177 19498075 20004761 17192785 17052657 17982457 22786590 21044948 20639541 21738487 21084426 20070850 21292315 19846850 16713924 21248740 18611956

22430674	Genome-wide haplotype association study identifies the FRMD4A gene as a risk locus for Alzheimer's disease.	Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have led to the discovery of nine new loci of genetic susceptibility in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the landscape of the AD genetic susceptibility is far away to be complete and in addition to single-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analyses as performed in conventional GWAS, complementary strategies need to be applied to overcome limitations inherent to this type of approaches. We performed a genome-wide haplotype association (GWHA) study in the EADI1 study (n=2025 AD cases and 5328 controls) by applying a sliding-windows approach. After exclusion of loci already known to be involved in AD (APOE, BIN1 and CR1), 91 regions with suggestive haplotype effects were identified. In a second step, we attempted to replicate the best suggestive haplotype associations in the GERAD1 consortium (2820 AD cases and 6356 controls) and observed that 9 of them showed nominal association. In a third step, we tested relevant haplotype associations in a combined analysis of five additional case-control studies (5093 AD cases and 4061 controls). We consistently replicated the association of a haplotype within FRMD4A on Chr.10p13 in all the data set analyzed (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: (1.43-1.96); P=1.1 × 10(-10)). We finally searched for association between SNPs within the FRMD4A locus and Aβ plasma concentrations in three independent non-demented populations (n=2579). We reported that polymorphisms were associated with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (best signal, P=5.4 × 10(-7)). In conclusion, combining both GWHA study and a conservative three-stage replication approach, we characterised FRMD4A as a new genetic risk factor of AD.	 21460841 21460840 21371880 21556001 21825135 11132093 21525986 16099744 11160418 11335065 12032543 12130773 12686588 15008795 14962947 6610841 2011243 8764620 16857570 16774684 17308338 17659844 17487883 17725986 17936506 17549762 18401021 19038212 19198611 19596566 19752451 19734902 19734903 20080746 20209079 20460622
22437554	Genome-wide association study identifies three common variants associated with serologic response to vitamin E supplementation in men.	Vitamin E inhibits lipid peroxidation in cell membranes, prevents oxidative damage to DNA by scavenging free radicals, and reduces carcinogen production. No study to our knowledge, however, has examined the association between genetic variants and response to long-term vitamin E supplementation. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of common variants associated with circulating α-tocopherol concentrations following 3 y of controlled supplementation. The study population included 2112 middle-aged, male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort who received a trial supplementation of α-tocopherol (50 mg/d) and had fasting serum α-tocopherol concentrations measured after 3 y. Serum concentrations were log-transformed for statistical analysis and general linear models adjusted for age, BMI, serum total cholesterol, and cancer case status. Associations with serum response to α-tocopherol supplementation achieved genome-wide significance for 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): rs964184 on 11q23.3 (P = 2.6 × 10(-12)) and rs2108622 on 19pter-p13.11 (P = 2.2 × 10(-7)), and approached genome-wide significance for one SNP, rs7834588 on 8q12.3 (P = 6.2 × 10(-7)). Combined, these SNP explain 3.4% of the residual variance in serum α-tocopherol concentrations during controlled vitamin E supplementation. A GWAS has identified 3 genetic variants at different loci that appear associated with serum concentrations after vitamin E supplementation in men. Identifying genetic variants that influence serum nutrient biochemical status (e.g., α-tocopherol) under supplementation conditions improves our understanding of the biological determinants of these nutritional exposures and their associations with cancer etiology.	 15184900 21878437 11074077 11837994 12453956 14704198 15006912 15105499 6327876 3084131 2159804 2166481 8364919 8205268 8736173 9200147 9481124 9523025 15741576 15769967 15814460 17060358 17234637 17693622 18193043 18433732 18667016 18776911 19060906 19066370 19185284 19190344 20160193 20363687 20418485 20686565 20688329 20696139 20981092 21228269 21273283 21729881 21990298 10782653
22419738	A genome-wide association study in the Japanese population confirms 9p21 and 14q23 as susceptibility loci for primary open angle glaucoma.	Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of leading causes of adult blindness worldwide. To identify genetic variants associated with susceptibility to POAG, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1394 cases and 6599 controls. Subsequently, we analyzed 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which showed suggestive association (P < 1 × 10(-4)) by GWAS, using an additional set of 1802 cases and 7212 controls. In addition to confirmation of the association of the chromosome 9p21 locus [rs1063192, P= 5.2 × 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 0.75], and 14q23 (rs10483727, P = 9.49 × 10(-8), OR = 0.79) with POAG in Caucasians reported recently, we identified a suggestive-associated locus on 2q21 (rs7588567, P = 3.89 × 10(-7), OR = 0.85). For these described SNPs, minor alleles are suspected to have a protective effect from the disease. An linkage disequilibrium block containing rs10483727 includes the SIX6 gene that was implicated to have a critical role in eye development, and genes in both represented loci (SIX6 on chromosome 14q23, and CDKN2A-CDKN2B on chromosome 9p21) are known to be expressed in human ocular tissues, including the retina. Our GWAS results should contribute to better insight into the genetic basis of POAG.	
22445761	Genome-wide association study of SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction in a Japanese cohort with major depression.	Sexual dysfunction is a major side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic factors contributing to the risk of SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction by testing 186 320 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in a cohort of 201 Japanese major depression patients including 36 with sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI (paroxetine or fluvoxamine) or SNRI (milnacipran). The Cochran-Armitage trend test showed that 11 SNPs, tightly clustered in a distinct region on chromosome 14q21.3, were associated with SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction at a genome-wide significance level after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, and the strongest SNP association was with rs1160351 (P=3.04 × 10(-7), risk ratio=2.92, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.79-4.76). These SNPs mapped to the intronic region of the MDGA2 gene. A Manhattan plot showed that the strong association peak remained in MDGA2 after adjustment for sex and age in a multivariable logistic regression analysis although P values increased slightly and became non-significant. Replication studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate this exploratory study, but our findings may provide insights into the genetic basis of sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI/SNRI.	
22446962	A genome-wide association study identifies three new risk loci for Kawasaki disease.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Kawasaki disease in Japanese subjects using data from 428 individuals with Kawasaki disease (cases) and 3,379 controls genotyped at 473,803 SNPs. We validated the association results in two independent replication panels totaling 754 cases and 947 controls. We observed significant associations in the FAM167A-BLK region at 8p22-23 (rs2254546, P = 8.2 × 10(-21)), in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21.3 (rs2857151, P = 4.6 × 10(-11)) and in the CD40 region at 20q13 (rs4813003, P = 4.8 × 10(-8)). We also replicated the association of a functional SNP of FCGR2A (rs1801274, P = 1.6 × 10(-6)) identified in a recently reported GWAS of Kawasaki disease. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease.	 19225526 11501945 18204098 6062087 21326860 18849075 22081228 20127135 18084290 19190534 2404338 17344890 21987091 18794853 19796918 21533171 19525955 21666691 21160486 19667185 19132087 15080268 19503088 19180478 20064465 20190274 16998491 19740902 12563087 16381912 20131239 7822795 17160344 21221998 20423928 20974990 20015095
22446963	Meta-analysis identifies nine new loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis in the Japanese population.	Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation. We report a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a Japanese population including 4,074 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (cases) and 16,891 controls, followed by a replication in 5,277 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 21,684 controls. Our study identified nine loci newly associated with rheumatoid arthritis at a threshold of P < 5.0 × 10(-8), including B3GNT2, ANXA3, CSF2, CD83, NFKBIE, ARID5B, PDE2A-ARAP1, PLD4 and PTPN2. ANXA3 was also associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (P = 0.0040), and B3GNT2 and ARID5B were associated with Graves' disease (P = 3.5 × 10(-4) and 2.9 × 10(-4), respectively). We conducted a multi-ancestry comparative analysis with a previous meta-analysis in individuals of European descent (5,539 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 20,169 controls). This provided evidence of shared genetic risks of rheumatoid arthritis between the populations.	 21505073 18794857 21738478 15838509 18408250 17982410 21383967 20453841 17982456 22291604 21211616 18794853 17804842 21115973 19950296 17804836 11179015 19898481 14608356 12833157 18852200 19503088 21452313 17554300 17437163 18794858 17873874 20453842
22446961	Two new susceptibility loci for Kawasaki disease identified through genome-wide association analysis.	To find new candidate loci predisposing individuals to Kawasaki disease, an acute vasculitis that affects children, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 622 individuals with Kawasaki disease (cases) and 1,107 controls in a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan, with replication in an independent Han Chinese sample of 261 cases and 550 controls. We report two new loci, one at BLK (encoding B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase) and one at CD40, that are associated with Kawasaki disease at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Our findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of immune activation and inflammation in Kawasaki disease pathogenesis.	 16282773 18204098 21326860 18982160 19282242 16862161 12111919 22081228 1537861 11230614 236368 18084290 19190534 20534021 10839798 15574639 17344890 19180486 18794853 7608542 16756465 8637903 19237439 1447658 19760064 19136631 8822996 19132087 11891296 19503088 16534213 16456024 15237263 19595612 12563087 20634952 12593727 9832593 2113446 15574600 17160344 21221998 18799149 16279844
22479419	Genome-wide association study of treatment refractory schizophrenia in Han Chinese.	We report the first genome-wide association study of a joint analysis using 795 Han Chinese individuals with treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS) and 806 controls. Three loci showed suggestive significant association with TRS were identified. These loci include: rs10218843 (P = 3.04 × 10(-7)) and rs11265461 (P = 1.94 × 10(-7)) are adjacent to signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1); rs4699030 (P = 1.94 × 10(-6)) and rs230529 (P = 1.74 × 10(-7)) are located in the gene nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1); and rs13049286 (P = 3.05 × 10(-5)) and rs3827219 (P = 1.66 × 10(-5)) fall in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (RIPK4). One isolated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs739617 (P = 3.87 × 10(-5)) was also identified to be associated with TRS. The -94delATTG allele (rs28362691) located in the promoter region of NFKB1 was identified by resequencing and was found to associate with TRS (P = 4.85 × 10(-6)). The promoter assay demonstrated that the -94delATTG allele had a significant lower promoter activity than the -94insATTG allele in the SH-SY5Y cells. This study suggests that rs28362691 in NFKB1 might be involved in the development of TRS.	 15313403 14613970 15356162 2199034 1740105 1639070 1423592 8101371 7909081 8018583 7961574 8678105 9012828 9091804 9529257 9690329 9895331 10212557 10490696 15539155 15601385 15749842 15752987 15916472 16402134 16534213 17202538 17522711 17720034 18031695 18005941 18198266 18359159 18282107 18551040 18923510 18615735 18677311 19058794 19363039 19571808 19571809 19571811 19844207 20185149 20818396 20699195 21593732 21682944 10706993 10972291 10948194 10813800 11743944 11791212 11931769 11950553 12023979 12145742 12364586 12851458 14532331 15329799
22452962	A genome-wide association study identifies a breast cancer risk variant in ERBB4 at 2q34: results from the Seoul Breast Cancer Study.	Although approximately 25 common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified to be independently associated with breast cancer risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the genetic risk variants reported to date only explain a small fraction of the heritability of breast cancer. Furthermore, GWAS-identified loci were primarily identified in women of European descent.	 17529974 17342955 17903305 18094435 18326623 18437204 18438407 19219042 19330027 19330030 19474294 19715440 20453838 20585626 20634204 20699374 21058334 21071540 21263130 20872241 21514219 21596841 21795501 21424380 21908515 11252954 11329055 11553815 12610533 9399875 15735025 16845089 17529967
22470424	A high-density genome-wide association screen of sporadic ALS in US veterans.	Following reports of an increased incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in U.S. veterans, we have conducted a high-density genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ALS outcome and survival time in a sample of U.S. veterans. We tested ∼1.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with ALS outcome in 442 incident Caucasian veteran cases diagnosed with definite or probable ALS and 348 Caucasian veteran controls. To increase power, we also included genotypes from 5909 publicly-available non-veteran controls in the analysis. In the survival analysis, we tested for association between SNPs and post-diagnosis survival time in 639 Caucasian veteran cases with definite or probable ALS. After this discovery phase, we performed follow-up genotyping of 299 SNPs in an independent replication sample of Caucasian veterans and non-veterans (ALS outcome: 183 cases and 961 controls; survival: 118 cases). Although no SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the discovery phase for either phenotype, three SNPs were statistically significant in the replication analysis of ALS outcome: rs6080539 (177 kb from PCSK2), rs7000234 (4 kb from ZNF704), and rs3113494 (13 kb from LOC100506746). Two SNPs located in genes that were implicated by previous GWA studies of ALS were marginally significant in the pooled analysis of discovery and replication samples: rs17174381 in DPP6 (p = 4.4×10(-4)) and rs6985069 near ELP3 (p = 4.8×10(-4)). Our results underscore the difficulty of identifying and convincingly replicating genetic associations with a rare and genetically heterogeneous disorder such as ALS, and suggest that common SNPs are unlikely to account for a substantial proportion of patients affected by this devastating disorder.	 11464847 20433412 14504316 14976155 5497881 3748267 7807156 7698505 9560156 15642900 16909025 17362836 17554300 17671248 17618154 17641152 17827064 18084291 20406759 20566859 20847462 20801717 20801718 20500116 21320987 19464757 21047878 21471184 21944778 21944779 21437630 20852312 18057069 18398418 18421218 18421219 18535397 18996918 18987618 19193627 19399866 19451621 19734901 19823194 19922117 19922125 19922138 20129626 19710046 14504315
22456796	A single-nucleotide polymorphism in ANK1 is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Japanese populations.	To identify a novel susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes, we performed an imputation-based, genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population using newly obtained imputed-genotype data for 2 229 890 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) estimated from previously reported, directly genotyped GWAS data in the same samples (stage 1: 4470 type 2 diabetes versus 3071 controls). We directly genotyped 43 new SNPs with P-values of <10(-4) in a part of stage-1 samples (2692 type 2 diabetes versus 3071 controls), and the associations of validated SNPs were evaluated in another 11 139 Japanese individuals (stage 2: 7605 type 2 diabetes versus 3534 controls). Combined meta-analysis using directly genotyped data for stages 1 and 2 revealed that rs515071 in ANK1 and rs7656416 near MGC21675 were associated with type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population at the genome-wide significant level (P < 5 × 10(-8)). The association of rs515071 was also observed in European GWAS data (combined P for all populations = 6.14 × 10(-10)). Rs7656416 was in linkage disequilibrium to rs6815464, which had recently been identified as a top signal in a meta-analysis of East Asian GWAS for type 2 diabetes (r(2) = 0.76 in stage 2). The association of rs7656416 with type 2 diabetes disappeared after conditioning on rs6815464. These results indicate that the ANK1 locus is a new, common susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes across different ethnic groups. The signal of association was weaker in the directly genotyped data, so the improvement in signal indicates the importance of imputation in this particular case.

22479191	Genome-wide association and functional follow-up reveals new loci for kidney function.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem with a genetic component. We performed genome-wide association studies in up to 130,600 European ancestry participants overall, and stratified for key CKD risk factors. We uncovered 6 new loci in association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the primary clinical measure of CKD, in or near MPPED2, DDX1, SLC47A1, CDK12, CASP9, and INO80. Morpholino knockdown of mpped2 and casp9 in zebrafish embryos revealed podocyte and tubular abnormalities with altered dextran clearance, suggesting a role for these genes in renal function. By providing new insights into genes that regulate renal function, these results could further our understanding of the pathogenesis of CKD.	 21909115 8666403 16102746 20502693 11315092 18974171 11979335 17873877 21289597 11904577 18510930 17953490 10075613 18344981 21931561 9806915 15664230 19004815 14970063 19128478 19834535 21307840 22155946 19654370 18193047 18462017 18295055 18586155 17986697 12883005 20686651 15562319 12958120 20383145 20616382 21378990 21150873 20383146 19644074 17873875 20222955 19430482 19222302 20417263 20634204 17699558 19788417 21602305 18348202 15625083 19361613 17873874 21355061 21129726 21289598 19966804
22479309	Genome-wide association study to identify common variants associated with brachial circumference: a meta-analysis of 14 cohorts.	Brachial circumference (BC), also known as upper arm or mid arm circumference, can be used as an indicator of muscle mass and fat tissue, which are distributed differently in men and women. Analysis of anthropometric measures of peripheral fat distribution such as BC could help in understanding the complex pathophysiology behind overweight and obesity. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic variants associated with BC through a large-scale genome-wide association scan (GWAS) meta-analysis. We used fixed-effects meta-analysis to synthesise summary results across 14 GWAS discovery and 4 replication cohorts comprising overall 22,376 individuals (12,031 women and 10,345 men) of European ancestry. Individual analyses were carried out for men, women, and combined across sexes using linear regression and an additive genetic model: adjusted for age and adjusted for age and BMI. We prioritised signals for follow-up in two-stages. We did not detect any signals reaching genome-wide significance. The FTO rs9939609 SNP showed nominal evidence for association (p<0.05) in the age-adjusted strata for men and across both sexes. In this first GWAS meta-analysis for BC to date, we have not identified any genome-wide significant signals and do not observe robust association of previously established obesity loci with BC. Large-scale collaborations will be necessary to achieve higher power to detect loci underlying BC.	 8477683 14639702 8651220 9098178 9887130 16077053 16641219 17123335 17254406 17434869 17572673 17701901 15277173 2921472 1938738 1570802 8429405 18502265 18830075 19079260 19079261 19234441 19584879 20509871 20698125 20816152 20955603 20935629 21274313 21731602 12512227 12958120 7889897
22479202	Novel loci for adiponectin levels and their influence on type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits: a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of 45,891 individuals.	Circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are highly heritable and are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and other metabolic traits. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in 39,883 individuals of European ancestry to identify genes associated with metabolic disease. We identified 8 novel loci associated with adiponectin levels and confirmed 2 previously reported loci (P = 4.5×10(-8)-1.2×10(-43)). Using a novel method to combine data across ethnicities (N = 4,232 African Americans, N = 1,776 Asians, and N = 29,347 Europeans), we identified two additional novel loci. Expression analyses of 436 human adipocyte samples revealed that mRNA levels of 18 genes at candidate regions were associated with adiponectin concentrations after accounting for multiple testing (p<3×10(-4)). We next developed a multi-SNP genotypic risk score to test the association of adiponectin decreasing risk alleles on metabolic traits and diseases using consortia-level meta-analytic data. This risk score was associated with increased risk of T2D (p = 4.3×10(-3), n = 22,044), increased triglycerides (p = 2.6×10(-14), n = 93,440), increased waist-to-hip ratio (p = 1.8×10(-5), n = 77,167), increased glucose two hours post oral glucose tolerance testing (p = 4.4×10(-3), n = 15,234), increased fasting insulin (p = 0.015, n = 48,238), but with lower in HDL-cholesterol concentrations (p = 4.5×10(-13), n = 96,748) and decreased BMI (p = 1.4×10(-4), n = 121,335). These findings identify novel genetic determinants of adiponectin levels, which, taken together, influence risk of T2D and markers of insulin resistance.	 20167083 20188786 20509871 20581827 20686565 17452330 17605308 17535986 17935668 17967414 18193043 18492747 18828732 18974833 18776141 19141678 19165155 19466213 19557161 19401414 19584347 19734900 19936222 20011104 20081858 20018283 20887962 20864672 20935629 20876611 20972250 21261639 21304890 21303902 21706003 22125221 11326751 11344187 11549668 12114044 12077138 12883005 12522134 12354786 12958120 14997420 15082700 15299019 15823385 16326714 16862161 16979396 16998510 17121786 17303804 17570946

22472876	A mega-analysis of genome-wide association studies for major depressive disorder.	Prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of major depressive disorder (MDD) have met with limited success. We sought to increase statistical power to detect disease loci by conducting a GWAS mega-analysis for MDD. In the MDD discovery phase, we analyzed more than 1.2 million autosomal and X chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 759 independent and unrelated subjects of recent European ancestry (9240 MDD cases and 9519 controls). In the MDD replication phase, we evaluated 554 SNPs in independent samples (6783 MDD cases and 50 695 controls). We also conducted a cross-disorder meta-analysis using 819 autosomal SNPs with P<0.0001 for either MDD or the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium bipolar disorder (BIP) mega-analysis (9238 MDD cases/8039 controls and 6998 BIP cases/7775 controls). No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the MDD discovery phase, the MDD replication phase or in pre-planned secondary analyses (by sex, recurrent MDD, recurrent early-onset MDD, age of onset, pre-pubertal onset MDD or typical-like MDD from a latent class analyses of the MDD criteria). In the MDD-bipolar cross-disorder analysis, 15 SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), and all were in a 248 kb interval of high LD on 3p21.1 (chr3:52 425 083-53 822 102, minimum P=5.9 × 10(-9) at rs2535629). Although this is the largest genome-wide analysis of MDD yet conducted, its high prevalence means that the sample is still underpowered to detect genetic effects typical for complex traits. Therefore, we were unable to identify robust and replicable findings. We discuss what this means for genetic research for MDD. The 3p21.1 MDD-BIP finding should be interpreted with caution as the most significant SNP did not replicate in MDD samples, and genotyping in independent samples will be needed to resolve its status.	 19065144 19292899 19339359 19416921 19482860 19474294 19531786 19571811 21199959 21263010 21697359 21482443 21896369 21926972 21926974 21924589 22001305 21042317 10891514 11007705 11315092 11565448 12063145 12063155 12707949 12813115 19736353 19847795 20029411 20081856 19918758 19107115 20453838 20562875 20581827 20516156 20732625 20673876 20811451 20881960 20935630 20972440 20981092 21104886 21102463 21217634 20038947 20125088 21282783 20167617 21521612 12869766 12884885 14601036 14662550 8629888 8656541 8966556 9366654 9766772 10064092 10401442 15263905 15767473 15961293 16203955 16731270 16300747 17254424 17554299 17472703 17726228 17136562 17943122 17854483 18366642 18348202 17938638 18852200 19002139 18691701 19200528
22488850	Genome-wide search for replicable risk gene regions in alcohol and nicotine co-dependence.	The present study searched for replicable risk genomic regions for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence using a genome-wide association strategy. The data contained a total of 3,143 subjects including 818 European-American (EA) cases with alcohol and nicotine co-dependence, 1,396 EA controls, 449 African-American (AA) cases, and 480 AA controls. We performed separate genome-wide association analyses in EAs and AAs and a meta-analysis to derive combined P-values, and calculated the genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) for each SNP. Regions with P < 5 × 10(-7) together with FDR < 0.05 in the meta-analysis were examined to detect all replicable risk SNPs across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis. These SNPs were followed with a series of functional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses. We found a unique genome-wide significant gene region--SH3BP5-NR2C2--that was enriched with 11 replicable risk SNPs for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence. The distributions of -log(P) values for all SNP-disease associations within this region were consistent across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis (0.315 ≤ r ≤ 0.868; 8.1 × 10(-52) ≤ P ≤ 3.6 × 10(-5)). In the meta-analysis, this region was the only association peak throughout chromosome 3 at P < 0.0001. All replicable risk markers available for eQTL analysis had nominal cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects on gene expression. The transcript expression of the genes in this region was regulated partly by several nicotine dependence (ND)-related genes and significantly correlated with transcript expression of many alcohol dependence- and ND-related genes. We concluded that the SH3BP5-NR2C2 region on Chromosome 3 might harbor causal loci for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence.	 20201924 20418889 21703634 22096494 21956439 11956970 12232773 12824337 15024690 8189735 15770103 16685648 16874522 17135278 17158188 17508996 17554300 17701901 17509535 18341651 17622222 18519826 18828811 19222302 19259974 19169923 16451628 20158304 20235792 20202923 20354512 20418888 21302341
22492993	C-reactive protein (CRP) promoter polymorphisms influence circulating CRP levels in a genome-wide association study of African Americans.	C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant protein produced primarily by the liver. Circulating CRP levels are influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors, including infection and obesity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an unbiased approach towards identifying loci influencing CRP levels. None of the six GWAS for CRP levels has been conducted in an African ancestry population. The present study aims to: (i) identify genetic variants that influence serum CRP in African Americans (AA) using a genome-wide association approach and replicate these findings in West Africans (WA), (ii) assess transferability of major signals for CRP reported in European ancestry populations (EA) to AA and (iii) use the weak linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure characteristic of African ancestry populations to fine-map the previously reported CRP locus. The discovery cohort comprised 837 unrelated AA, with the replication of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assessed in 486 WA. The association analysis was conducted with 2 366 856 genotyped and imputed SNPs under an additive genetic model with adjustment for appropriate covariates. Genome-wide and replication significances were set at P < 5 × 10(-8) and P < 0.05, respectively. Ten SNPs in (CRP pseudogene-1) CRPP1 and CRP genes were associated with serum CRP (P = 2.4 × 10(-09) to 4.3 × 10(-11)). All but one of the top-scoring SNPs associated with CRP in AA were successfully replicated in WA. CRP signals previously identified in EA samples were transferable to AAs, and we were able to fine-map this signal, reducing the region of interest from the 25 kb of LD around the locus in the HapMap CEU sample to only 8 kb in our AA sample.	 10595891 11164120 12958120 14988271 2461709 2464504 9077376 9359411 15897982 16250263 16002176 16550411 16713426 16862161 17101857 17327459 17554299 17868801 18237431 18439548 18439552 18805107 19095723 19095725 19503614 19567438 19609347 20027299 20395969 20694148 20616382 20935630 21300955 21196492 21294900 21188353 22085899 21647738
22493691	Novel associations for hypothyroidism include known autoimmune risk loci.	Hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid disorder, affecting about 5% of the general population. Here we present the current largest genome-wide association study of hypothyroidism, in 3,736 cases and 35,546 controls. Hypothyroidism was assessed via web-based questionnaires. We identify five genome-wide significant associations, three of which are well known to be involved in a large spectrum of autoimmune diseases: rs6679677 near PTPN22, rs3184504 in SH2B3, and rs2517532 in the HLA class I region (p-values 2.8·10(-13), 2.6·10(-12), and 1.3·10(-8), respectively). We also report associations with rs4915077 near VAV3 (p-value 7.5·10(-10)) and rs925489 near FOXE1 (p value 2.4·10(-19)). VAV3 is involved in immune function, and FOXE1 and PTPN22 have previously been associated with hypothyroidism. Although the HLA class I region and SH2B3 have previously been linked with a number of autoimmune diseases, this is the first report of their association with thyroid disease. The VAV3 association is also novel. We also show suggestive evidence of association for hypothyroidism with a SNP in the HLA class II region (independent of the other HLA association) as well as SNPs in CAPZB, PDE8B, and CTLA4. CAPZB and PDE8B have been linked to TSH levels and CTLA4 to a variety of autoimmune diseases. These results suggest heterogeneity in the genetic etiology of hypothyroidism, implicating genes involved in both autoimmune disorders and thyroid function. Using a genetic risk profile score based on the top association from each of the five genome-wide significant regions in our study, the relative risk between the highest and lowest deciles of genetic risk is 2.0.	 16760194 17133608 17554260 17632545 18028494 18081880 18514160 18587394 18779568 18852199 19197348 19302045 19198613 19730683 19648290 20041220 20363978 20453517 20560212 20585627 20604685 20508602 20442750 20634204 20826269 19430483 21307958 21436304 21565293 21738487 21852963 21841780 21981779 22029983 17952073 11288988 12930761 14623913 15504986 1676351 9398726 9784418 10523675 15531553 15719322 15789306 15863666 16007166 16352685 16968949
22482804	Combined analysis of genome-wide association studies for Crohn disease and psoriasis identifies seven shared susceptibility loci.	Psoriasis (PS) and Crohn disease (CD) have been shown to be epidemiologically, pathologically, and therapeutically connected, but little is known about their shared genetic causes. We performed meta-analyses of five published genome-wide association studies on PS (2,529 cases and 4,955 controls) and CD (2,142 cases and 5,505 controls), followed up 20 loci that showed strongest evidence for shared disease association and, furthermore, tested cross-disease associations for previously reported PS and CD risk alleles in additional 6,115 PS cases, 4,073 CD cases, and 10,100 controls. We identified seven susceptibility loci outside the human leukocyte antigen region (9p24 near JAK2, 10q22 at ZMIZ1, 11q13 near PRDX5, 16p13 near SOCS1, 17q21 at STAT3, 19p13 near FUT2, and 22q11 at YDJC) shared between PS and CD with genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) and confirmed four already established PS and CD risk loci (IL23R, IL12B, REL, and TYK2). Three of the shared loci are also genome-wide significantly associated with PS alone (10q22 at ZMIZ1, p(rs1250544) = 3.53 × 10(-8), 11q13 near PRDX5, p(rs694739) = 3.71 × 10(-09), 22q11 at YDJC, p(rs181359) = 8.02 × 10(-10)). In addition, we identified one susceptibility locus for CD (16p13 near SOCS1, p(rs4780355) = 4.99 × 10(-8)). Refinement of association signals identified shared genome-wide significant associations for exonic SNPs at 10q22 (ZMIZ1) and in silico expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that the associations at ZMIZ1 and near SOCS1 have a potential functional effect on gene expression. Our results show the usefulness of joint analyses of clinically distinct immune-mediated diseases and enlarge the map of shared genetic risk loci.	 17658397 21300624 17728769 17873877 18438405 18219280 18587394 18852200 18723019 19169254 19169255 19200528 19440360 19557189 18976050 19915574 19903540 10837055 10910765 11315092 11535550 11687797 12437126 12789169 14872505 15157825 15358699 15381238 7066192 8304761 9202125 9735374 15537905 16032514 16143122 16280321 16490960 16862161 16777850 17068223 17236132 17435760 17554300 17437504 20039379 20176734 20811451 20852385 20953186 20953187 20953188 20953189 20953190 20981092 21102463 21298027 21364948 21383967 21677747 21852963 17701901
22484627	A genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies new childhood  obesity loci.	Multiple genetic variants have been associated with adult obesity and a few with severe obesity in childhood; however, less progress has been made in establishing genetic influences on common early-onset obesity. We performed a North American, Australian and European collaborative meta-analysis of 14 studies consisting of 5,530 cases (≥95th percentile of body mass index (BMI)) and 8,318 controls (<50th percentile of BMI) of European ancestry. Taking forward the eight newly discovered signals yielding association with P < 5 × 10(-6) in nine independent data sets (2,818 cases and 4,083 controls), we observed two loci that yielded genome-wide significant combined P values near OLFM4 at 13q14 (rs9568856; P = 1.82 × 10(-9); odds ratio (OR) = 1.22) and within HOXB5 at 17q21 (rs9299; P = 3.54 × 10(-9); OR = 1.14). Both loci continued to show association when two extreme childhood obesity cohorts were included (2,214 cases and 2,674 controls). These two loci also yielded directionally consistent associations in a previous meta-analysis of adult BMI(1).	 19478790 20421936 20543949 20534456 18830786 11916765 19818289 12950074 15837955 17434869 18443890 20935630 20724581 12795448
22491018	Genome-wide association analysis implicates the involvement of eight loci with response to tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease affecting the joints. A heterogeneous response to available therapies demonstrates the need to identify those patients likely to benefit from a particular therapy. Our objective was to identify genetic factors associated with response to tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor, recently approved for treating RA. We report the first genome-wide association study on the response to tocilizumab in 1683 subjects with RA from six clinical studies. Putative associations were identified with eight loci, previously unrecognized as linked to the IL-6 pathway or associated with RA risk. This study suggests that it is unlikely that a major genetic determinant of response exists, and it illustrates the complexity of performing genome-wide association scans in clinical trials.

Circulating cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) is a useful indicator of cell death, and it can also be used to predict outcomes in various clinical disorders. Several innate immune mechanisms are known to be involved in eliminating DNA and chromatin-related material as part of the inhibition of potentially harmful autoimmune responses. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the clearance of circulating cf-DNA is currently unclear.	 20098460 18263651 18875018 17893976 17658951 21277292 22167588 17454749 17108224 19890330 8648125 17846035 10836148 15819697 19715440 10444277 15777743 11239235 20529971 19414484 10926886 17516210 10772627 17764847 15297300 17478602 15749864 20233392 11708489 9915961 8557992 21303947 21058334 6609032 18288107 17701901 21189867 16126188 19389676 10748067 7565971 18480185
22504419	Common variants at 12q15 and 12q24 are associated with infant head circumference.	To identify genetic variants associated with head circumference in infancy, we performed a meta-analysis of seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (N = 10,768 individuals of European ancestry enrolled in pregnancy and/or birth cohorts) and followed up three lead signals in six replication studies (combined N = 19,089). rs7980687 on chromosome 12q24 (P = 8.1 × 10(-9)) and rs1042725 on chromosome 12q15 (P = 2.8 × 10(-10)) were robustly associated with head circumference in infancy. Although these loci have previously been associated with adult height, their effects on infant head circumference were largely independent of height (P = 3.8 × 10(-7) for rs7980687 and P = 1.3 × 10(-7) for rs1042725 after adjustment for infant height). A third signal, rs11655470 on chromosome 17q21, showed suggestive evidence of association with head circumference (P = 3.9 × 10(-6)). SNPs correlated to the 17q21 signal have shown genome-wide association with adult intracranial volume, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that a common genetic variant in this region might link early brain growth with neurological disease in later life.	 19915575 19801982 20032050 19931588 20485568 20502693 20930301 20881960 20707707 21292315 22504418 10709729 10938106 11118825 11315092 12958120 14570040 14645144 14966169 15030402 15093150 1274898 8287794 7651535 8660127 8885239 15593017 16524956 16829198 17015539 17060066 17308053 18348183 17239994 18462017 18629877 18846210 19001166 18543312 19215732 20031568 18948254 19633095
22504417	Identification of common variants associated with human hippocampal and intracranial volumes.	Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major depression and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 × 10(-16)) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 × 10(-12)). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 × 10(-7)).	 9545414 10352148 15724142 16077740 21217833 21397060 20517342 21352927 21565292 21572988 20585324 21784356 21502949 21814201 21926972 21926974 21848658 22504421 16496310 17209804 17415783 19070572 19200528 19222302 19261882 19162198 19477152 19345287 19474294 19409535 19786105 19682030 20233392 20060826 20522523 20616382 20176115 20634204 20881960 20162602 10618008 10716738 17572673 17717601 17924335 18004397 18193045 18391951 18391952 18177358 17765485 18675918 18958166 11153720 11293691 11315092 11818967 11832223 12194864 12377157 12499305 15355855 15488422 15501092 15514393 9067838
22504418	Common variants at 6q22 and 17q21 are associated with intracranial volume.	During aging, intracranial volume remains unchanged and represents maximally attained brain size, while various interacting biological phenomena lead to brain volume loss. Consequently, intracranial volume and brain volume in late life reflect different genetic influences. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,175 community-dwelling elderly persons did not reveal any associations at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for brain volume. In contrast, intracranial volume was significantly associated with two loci: rs4273712 (P = 3.4 × 10(-11)), a known height-associated locus on chromosome 6q22, and rs9915547 (P = 1.5 × 10(-12)), localized to the inversion on chromosome 17q21. We replicated the associations of these loci with intracranial volume in a separate sample of 1,752 elderly persons (P = 1.1 × 10(-3) for 6q22 and 1.2 × 10(-3) for 17q21). Furthermore, we also found suggestive associations of the 17q21 locus with head circumference in 10,768 children (mean age of 14.5 months). Our data identify two loci associated with head size, with the inversion at 17q21 also likely to be involved in attaining maximal brain size.	 15654335 15653178 15866152 16906164 17015539 18157829 17239994 18628315 19369658 19165922 18543312 20031568 20157246 20116045 20032050 20460622 20881960 22504419 15813938 9626291 10842357 12815504 14645144 14966169 15030402 15143299
22504421	Common variants at 12q14 and 12q24 are associated with hippocampal volume.	Aging is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume that are accelerated by Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of <4.0 × 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 × 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 × 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 × 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 × 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.	 20573900 16362079 20534741 20616382 20127416 19079132 19161620 19477153 19617854 19734902 19734903 20031568 20377889 20460622 21209886 21312223 21383047 21391232 21460840 21460841 21572988 21593202 21327095 20409609 10588446 11811670 12427887 12453673 12477704 12925848 14595538 15226462 15208641 2902740 16987729 17982457 18474741 18462017 18466898 18846210 18761411 2329376 8784137 9130713 10075695 10430233 16002470 16216937 16243436 20414817
22504420	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 56 bone mineral density loci and reveals 14 loci associated with risk of fracture.	Bone mineral density (BMD) is the most widely used predictor of fracture risk. We performed the largest meta-analysis to date on lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, including 17 genome-wide association studies and 32,961 individuals of European and east Asian ancestry. We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P < 5 × 10(-4), Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P < 5 × 10(-8), including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1). These findings shed light on the genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying BMD variation and fracture susceptibility.	 16723389 16481635 17144789 17109061 17572673 17323110 17676998 17873874 17943122 18349089 18344981 18348202 18382763 18455228 18445777 18485052 19079262 19373277 19369657 19557189 19715440 19700477 19841454 19801982 19838192 19808636 20096396 21878516 20233392 20220756 20502693 19654370 21533022 21524248 21407268 21798870 21998597 19922823 20548944 20647212 20876667 20431112 20881960 20949110 21283786 11179006 11207362 11731797 11855950 12050122 14584886 7870860 10527181 15940371 17137849
22494929	Meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies identifies four genetic loci associated with thyroid function.	Thyroid hormones play key roles in cellular growth, development and metabolism. Although there is a strong genetic influence on thyroid hormone levels, the genes involved are widely unknown. The levels of circulating thyroid hormones are tightly regulated by thyrotropin (TSH), which also represents the most important diagnostic marker for thyroid function. Therefore, in order to identify genetic loci associated with TSH levels, we performed a discovery meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies including two cohorts from Germany, KORA (n = 1287) and SHIP (n = 2449), resulting in a total sample size of 3736. Four genetic loci at 5q13.3, 1p36, 16q23 and 4q31 were associated with serum TSH levels. The lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms of these four loci were located within PDE8B encoding phosphodiesterase 8B, upstream of CAPZB that encodes the β-subunit of the barbed-end F-actin-binding protein, in a former 'gene desert' that was recently demonstrated to encode a functional gene (LOC440389) associated with thyroid volume, and upstream of NR3C2 encoding the mineralocorticoid receptor. The latter association for the first time suggests the modulation of thyroid function by mineral corticoids. All four loci were replicated in three additional cohorts: the HUNT study from Norway (n = 1487) and the two German studies CARLA (CARLA, n = 1357) and SHIP-TREND (n = 883). Together, these four quantitative trait loci accounted for ∼3.3% of the variance in TSH serum levels. These results contribute to our understanding of genetic factors and physiological mechanisms mediating thyroid function.	
22508271	Fasting glucose GWAS candidate region analysis across ethnic groups in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).	Genetic variants associated with fasting glucose in European ancestry populations are increasingly well understood. However, the nature of the associations between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fasting glucose in other racial and ethnic groups is unclear. We sought to examine regions previously identified to be associated with fasting glucose in Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across multiple ethnicities in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Nondiabetic MESA participants with fasting glucose measured at the baseline exam and with GWAS genotyping were included; 2,349 Caucasians, 664 individuals of Chinese descent, 1,366 African Americans, and 1,171 Hispanics. Genotype data were generated from the Affymetrix 6.0 array and imputation in IMPUTE. Fasting glucose was regressed on SNP dosage data in each ethnic group adjusting for age, gender, MESA study center, and ethnic-specific principal components. SNPs from the three gene regions with the strongest associations to fasting glucose in previous Caucasian GWAS (MTNR1B / GCK / G6PC2) were examined in depth. There was limited power to replicate associations in other ethnic groups due to smaller allele frequencies and limited sample size; SNP associations may also have differed across ethnic groups due to differing linkage disequilibrium patterns with causal variants. rs10830963 in MTNR1B and rs4607517 in GCK demonstrated consistent magnitude and direction of association with fasting glucose across ethnic groups, although the associations were often not nominally significant. In conclusion, certain SNPs in MTNR1B and GCK demonstrate consistent effects across four racial and ethnic groups, narrowing the putative region for these causal variants.	 20536959 20668700 20616382 20805255 21188353 21701235 11867360 12397006 14671192 14685227 16862161 17186458 17391554 17194218 17703236 18451265 18521185 19060907 19060909 19082990 19073768 19241057 19373277 19543373 19651812 19937311 20081858 20029179
22524403	CHRNB3 is more strongly associated with Fagerström test for cigarette dependence-based nicotine dependence than cigarettes per day: phenotype definition changes genome-wide association studies results.	Nicotine dependence is a highly heritable disorder associated with severe medical morbidity and mortality. Recent meta-analyses have found novel genetic loci associated with cigarettes per day (CPD), a proxy for nicotine dependence. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of phenotype definition (i.e., CPD versus Fagerström test for cigarette dependence (FTCD) score as a measure of nicotine dependence) on genome-wide association studies of nicotine dependence.	 17701901 20718045 18193043 18193045 20700436 19500157 10576299 10923994 1932883 9819066 15543147 15833575 16314871 16539894 16862161 17135278 17158188 18055561 18227835 18256235 18385739 18385676 18618000 18957677 19029397 18704094 19706762 19698703 19760673 20418888 20418889 18065163
22532574	Identification of a novel percent mammographic density locus at 12q24.	Percent mammographic density adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI) is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer and has a heritable component that remains largely unidentified. We performed a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of percent mammographic density to identify novel genetic loci associated with this trait. In stage 1, we combined three GWASs of percent density comprised of 1241 women from studies at the Mayo Clinic and identified the top 48 loci (99 single nucleotide polymorphisms). We attempted replication of these loci in 7018 women from seven additional studies (stage 2). The meta-analysis of stage 1 and 2 data identified a novel locus, rs1265507 on 12q24, associated with percent density, adjusting for age and BMI (P = 4.43 × 10(-8)). We refined the 12q24 locus with 459 additional variants (stage 3) in a combined analysis of all three stages (n = 10 377) and confirmed that rs1265507 has the strongest association in the 12q24 region (P = 1.03 × 10(-8)). Rs1265507 is located between the genes TBX5 and TBX3, which are members of the phylogenetically conserved T-box gene family and encode transcription factors involved in developmental regulation. Understanding the mechanism underlying this association will provide insight into the genetics of breast tissue composition.	 20453838 20616382 10977110 12239257 15084230 8988165 9106643 9207801 9865433 15551535 16775176 16933995 17529973 17572673 18245468 18846210 19543373 19715440 20634204 20702402 21058334 20802524 21278746 22039763 22267197 17701901
22542470	Genome-wide association study of antibody response to smallpox vaccine.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of antibody levels in a multi-ethnic group of 1071 healthy smallpox vaccine recipients. In Caucasians, the most prominent association was found with promoter SNP rs10489759 in the LOC647132 pseudogene on chromosome 1 (p=7.77×10(-8)). In African-Americans, we identified eight genetic loci at p<5×10(-7). The SNP association with the lowest p-value (rs10508727, p=1.05×10(-10)) was in the Mohawk homeobox (MKX) gene on chromosome 10. Other candidate genes included LOC388460, GPR158, ZHX2, SPIRE1, GREM2, CSMD1, and RUNX1. In Hispanics, the top six associations between genetic variants and antibody levels had p-values less than 5×10(-7), with p=1.78×10(-10) for the strongest statistical association (promoter SNP rs12256830 in the PCDH15 gene). In addition, SNP rs4748153 in the immune response gene PRKCQ (protein kinase C, theta) was significantly associated with neutralizing antibody levels (p=2.51×10(-8)). Additional SNP associations in Hispanics (p≤3.40×10(-7)) were mapped to the KIF6/LOC100131899, CYP2C9, and ANKLE2/GOLGA3 genes. This study has identified candidate SNPs that may be important in regulating humoral immunity to smallpox vaccination. Replication studies, as well as studies elucidating the functional consequences of contributing genes and polymorphisms, are underway.	 11315092 20668219 12617510 12824210 12870127 12741956 8294877 7935454 10367824 15716906 15822186 16862161 17036314 17186465 17307972 17554300 17570108 17971814 18222355 18510970 18454680 18463160 20538994 21216289 21592983 21742843 22011202 19200827 19609347 19472401 19535540 19816713 20160197 20498044 11747823
22541561	A genome-wide association study reveals that variants within the HLA region are associated with risk for nonobstructive azoospermia.	A genome-wide association study of Han Chinese subjects was conducted to identify genetic susceptibility loci for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). In the discovery stage, 802 azoospermia cases and 1,863 controls were screened for genetic variants in the genome. Promising SNPs were subsequently confirmed in two independent sets of subjects: 818 azoospermia cases and 1,755 controls from northern China, and 606 azoospermia cases and 958 controls from central and southern China. We detected variants at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions that were independently associated with NOA (HLA-DRA, rs3129878, p(combine) = 3.70 × 10(-16), odds ratio [OR] = 1.37; C6orf10 and BTNL2, rs498422, p(combine) = 2.43 × 10(-12), OR = 1.42).

22570617	Common variants at 9p21 and 8q22 are associated with increased susceptibility to optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma.	Optic nerve degeneration caused by glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Patients affected by the normal-pressure form of glaucoma are more likely to harbor risk alleles for glaucoma-related optic nerve disease. We have performed a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association studies for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) followed by a normal-pressure glaucoma (NPG, defined by intraocular pressure (IOP) less than 22 mmHg) subgroup analysis. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed the most significant associations were tested for association with a second form of glaucoma, exfoliation-syndrome glaucoma. The overall meta-analysis of the GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR dataset results (3,146 cases and 3,487 controls) identified significant associations between two loci and POAG: the CDKN2BAS region on 9p21 (rs2157719 [G], OR = 0.69 [95%CI 0.63-0.75], p = 1.86×10⁻¹⁸), and the SIX1/SIX6 region on chromosome 14q23 (rs10483727 [A], OR = 1.32 [95%CI 1.21-1.43], p = 3.87×10⁻¹¹). In sub-group analysis two loci were significantly associated with NPG: 9p21 containing the CDKN2BAS gene (rs2157719 [G], OR = 0.58 [95% CI 0.50-0.67], p = 1.17×10⁻¹²) and a probable regulatory region on 8q22 (rs284489 [G], OR = 0.62 [95% CI 0.53-0.72], p = 8.88×10⁻¹⁰). Both NPG loci were also nominally associated with a second type of glaucoma, exfoliation syndrome glaucoma (rs2157719 [G], OR = 0.59 [95% CI 0.41-0.87], p = 0.004 and rs284489 [G], OR = 0.76 [95% CI 0.54-1.06], p = 0.021), suggesting that these loci might contribute more generally to optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma. Because both loci influence transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, we performed a genomic pathway analysis that showed an association between the TGF-beta pathway and NPG (permuted p = 0.009). These results suggest that neuro-protective therapies targeting TGF-beta signaling could be effective for multiple forms of glaucoma.	 11158794 21447600 17229557 21212179 18452762 20395239 20811162 17571346 9683145 20548946 20101282 21532571 16488940 15881652 18421074 19361779 21765929 20386740 19031438 22116958 21546528 16078232 11404479 21383504 21593627 21151960 20375339 19715440 21139683 21307088 21279722 8078588 16938560 21873608 20858511 20347935 21855671 20363506 21398277 20091798 20616382 22266513 21908583 8425829 22058429 17690259 21031560 21427129 12809483 20457974 20335623 21058334 16043855 21282571 20835238 17701901 20520743 21307941 21633235 16219726 22828004 21562585 19933162 17591886 12767908 21379331 19305407 20702827
22538805	Genome-wide association identifies the T gene as a novel asthma pharmacogenetic locus.	To date, most studies aimed at discovering genetic factors influencing treatment response in asthma have focused on biologic candidate genes.

22558069	Association of common variants in TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13, and ANXA3 with serum levels of non-albumin protein and immunoglobulin isotypes in Japanese.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on levels of serum total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), and non-albumin protein (NAP). We analyzed SNPs on autosomal chromosomes using data from 9,103 Japanese individuals, followed by a replication study of 1,600 additional individuals. We confirmed the previously- reported association of GCKR on chromosome 2p23.3 with serum ALB (rs1260326, P(meta) = 3.1 × 10(-9)), and additionally identified the significant genome-wide association of rs4985726 in TNFRSF13B on 17p11.2 with both TP and NAP (P(meta) = 1.2 × 10(-14) and 7.1 × 10(-24), respectively). For NAP, rs3803800 and rs11552708 in TNFSF13 on 17p13.1 (P(meta) = 7.2 × 10(-15) and 7.5 × 10(-10), respectively) as well as rs10007186 on 4q21.2 near ANXA3 (P(meta) = 1.3 × 10(-9)) also indicated significant associations. Interestingly, TNFRSF13B and TNFSF13 encode a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and its ligand, which together constitute an important receptor-ligand axis for B-cell homeostasis and immunoglobulin production. Furthermore, three SNPs, rs4985726, rs3803800, and rs11552708 in TNFRSF13B and TNFSF13, were indicated to be associated with serum levels of IgG (P<2.3 × 10(-3)) and IgM (P<0.018), while rs3803800 and rs11552708 were associated with IgA (P<0.013). Rs10007186 in 4q21.2 was associated with serum levels of IgA (P = 0.036), IgM (P = 0.019), and IgE (P = 4.9 × 10(-4)). Our results should add interesting knowledge about the regulation of major serum components.	 18439548 19209234 19503597 19417063 20139978 20354512 21738478 11917092 12413530 12730512 14988498 9497492 9550422 9743536 15630136 15829241 16007086 16914324 17119122 17701901 17982410 18464913 18514565 18846228 18678614 19060910 11571266
22558097	A genome-wide association study of total bilirubin and cholelithiasis risk in sickle cell anemia.	Serum bilirubin levels have been associated with polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 promoter in normal populations and in patients with hemolytic anemias, including sickle cell anemia. When hemolysis occurs circulating heme increases, leading to elevated bilirubin levels and an increased incidence of cholelithiasis. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bilirubin levels and cholelithiasis risk in a discovery cohort of 1,117 sickle cell anemia patients. We found 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with total bilirubin levels at the genome-wide significance level (p value <5 × 10(-8)). SNPs in UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A8 and UGT1A10, different isoforms within the UGT1A locus, were identified (most significant rs887829, p = 9.08 × 10(-25)). All of these associations were validated in 4 independent sets of sickle cell anemia patients. We tested the association of the 15 SNPs with cholelithiasis in the discovery cohort and found a significant association (most significant p value 1.15 × 10(-4)). These results confirm that the UGT1A region is the major regulator of bilirubin metabolism in African Americans with sickle cell anemia, similar to what is observed in other ethnicities.	 11843828 21527519 12173031 12426562 12604413 12672732 12677174 12732365 12806614 12816916 7114401 1624972 7565971 9535849 9858792 15388579 15710570 16089348 16044312 16265433 16291595 16628735 16844493 11230743 11257278 11443474 11677206 16862161 17000907 17084951 17347060 17593033 17850628 17903293 18343383 18375480 18461136 18503403 18392554 18823864 18756540 18790042 19364970 19414484 19419973 20029952 20193274 20233392 19932645 20639394 20709051 21058334 20837016 21309756 21353662 21538282 11878580
22544366	Meta-analysis identifies six new susceptibility loci for atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation is a highly prevalent arrhythmia and a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and death. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry, including 6,707 with and 52,426 without atrial fibrillation. Six new atrial fibrillation susceptibility loci were identified and replicated in an additional sample of individuals of European ancestry, including 5,381 subjects with and 10,030 subjects without atrial fibrillation (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Four of the loci identified in Europeans were further replicated in silico in a GWAS of Japanese individuals, including 843 individuals with and 3,350 individuals without atrial fibrillation. The identified loci implicate candidate genes that encode transcription factors related to cardiopulmonary development, cardiac-expressed ion channels and cell signaling molecules.	 17982011 17761684 18923542 18974171 19141561 19584346 19597491 19597492 20062060 20062063 20173747 20215401 20733104 21076174 10664157 11842093 12126934 12177436 12750403 15117820 9070470 16407510 16908781 17254821 17603472 17873874 18222980
22544364	A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for Wilms tumor.	Wilms tumor is the most common renal malignancy of childhood. To identify common variants that confer susceptibility to Wilms tumor, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 757 individuals with Wilms tumor (cases) and 1,879 controls. We evaluated ten SNPs in regions significantly associated at P < 5 × 10(-5) in two independent replication series from the UK (769 cases and 2,814 controls) and the United States (719 cases and 1,037 controls). We identified clear significant associations at 2p24 (rs3755132, P = 1.03 × 10(-14); rs807624, P = 1.32 × 10(-14)) and 11q14 (rs790356, P = 4.25 × 10(-15)). Both regions contain genes that are plausibly related to Wilms tumorigenesis. We also identified candidate association signals at 5q14, 22q12 and Xp22.	 20571064 10884224 15483024 2175212 7731693 8755482 16224025 16700047 16690728 17175381 17898773 18027087 18710941 18836444 19029932

22570627	Common genetic determinants of intraocular pressure and primary open-angle glaucoma.	Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a highly heritable risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma and is the only target for current glaucoma therapy. The genetic factors which determine IOP are largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study for IOP in 11,972 participants from 4 independent population-based studies in The Netherlands. We replicated our findings in 7,482 participants from 4 additional cohorts from the UK, Australia, Canada, and the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 2/Blue Mountains Eye Study. IOP was significantly associated with rs11656696, located in GAS7 at 17p13.1 (p=1.4×10(-8)), and with rs7555523, located in TMCO1 at 1q24.1 (p=1.6×10(-8)). In a meta-analysis of 4 case-control studies (total N = 1,432 glaucoma cases), both variants also showed evidence for association with glaucoma (p=2.4×10(-2) for rs11656696 and p=9.1×10(-4) for rs7555523). GAS7 and TMCO1 are highly expressed in the ciliary body and trabecular meshwork as well as in the lamina cribrosa, optic nerve, and retina. Both genes functionally interact with known glaucoma disease genes. These data suggest that we have identified two clinically relevant genes involved in IOP regulation.	 19470466 19625618 19420341 19805132 19038621 18974171 19151388 19379482 20111673 19449125 19875670 20485516 20548946 20237253 19430479 19430483 20835238 21532571 20018682 10767336 10801388 11795944 11834836 11914555 12049575 12939305 14516799 14597044 14691154 15031169 15137056 15054401 8366922 8188062 19536175 19959812 19628742 19696167 9005853 9627643 9736752 10196380 15640920 15671282 15722304 15677485 15948147 15921747 15939473 15919228 16186354 16186355 16518310 16606871 16723468 16862071 16877390 17210855 17343850 17384015 17652737 17924335 17955331 18060068 18200594 18274669 18653607 18455446
22570697	Genome-wide association study of multiple sclerosis confirms a novel locus at 5p13.1.	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive and disabling neurological condition affecting young adults in the world today. From a genetic point of view, MS is a complex disorder resulting from the combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. We aimed to identify previously unidentified loci conducting a new GWAS of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in a sample of 296 MS cases and 801 controls from the Spanish population. Meta-analysis of our data in combination with previous GWAS was done. A total of 17 GWAS-significant SNPs, corresponding to three different loci were identified:HLA, IL2RA, and 5p13.1. All three have been previously reported as GWAS-significant. We confirmed our observation in 5p13.1 for rs9292777 using two additional independent Spanish samples to make a total of 4912 MS cases and 7498 controls (ORpooled = 0.84; 95%CI: 0.80-0.89; p = 1.36 × 10-9). This SNP differs from the one reported within this locus in a recent GWAS. Although it is unclear whether both signals are tapping the same genetic association, it seems clear that this locus plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MS.	 17660530 20944657 17873877 18542080 18974171 21833088 19010793 19022862 19525953 19644074 19775910 20453840 20502693 20500880 20566843 21058334 21102463 11456302 11524377 11603614 12045153 4128558 6847134 16862161 17252545 17447842 17554300 17194218 17701901 21297633 17873874
22554406	Family-based genome-wide association study of frontal θ oscillations identifies potassium channel gene KCNJ6.	Event-related oscillations (EROs) represent highly heritable neuroelectric correlates of cognitive processes that manifest deficits in alcoholics and in offspring at high risk to develop alcoholism. Theta ERO to targets in the visual oddball task has been shown to be an endophenotype for alcoholism. A family-based genome-wide association study was performed for the frontal theta ERO phenotype using 634 583 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 1560 family members from 117 families densely affected by alcohol use disorders, recruited in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism. Genome-wide significant association was found with several SNPs on chromosome 21 in KCNJ6 (a potassium inward rectifier channel; KIR3.2/GIRK2), with the most significant SNP at P = 4.7 × 10(-10)). The same SNPs were also associated with EROs from central and parietal electrodes, but with less significance, suggesting that the association is frontally focused. One imputed synonymous SNP in exon four, highly correlated with our top three SNPs, was significantly associated with the frontal theta ERO phenotype. These results suggest KCNJ6 or its product GIRK2 account for some of the variations in frontal theta band oscillations. GIRK2 receptor activation contributes to slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials that modulate neuronal excitability, and therefore influence neuronal networks.	 21040841 9331358 21971461 16862161 18602904 15372034 11163901 10221750 16150631 7624485 12354627 12097489 18955071 10923994 9159640 7927323 20201924 8644716 8189735 21234875 18698588 20943350 8353611 19309316 19220591 17129626 10025584 3989713 12963675 7529682 19561601 8929423 18616934 19200528 9579105 18618593 15451410 20962238 22017986 11489606 11718888 1202204 21300945 21307845 16149083 15826840 20927044 17982586 18634760 9603606 9634505 16823639 17135278 18625208 20220551 10908597 21184583 17701901 20557431 16213472 16926113 12606066 20942817 16843012 15583116 15218136 17314302 11163900 10474063 15210286 20828426 10615721
22556244	Melanesian blond hair is caused by an amino acid change in TYRP1.	Naturally blond hair is rare in humans and found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania. Here, we identify an arginine-to-cysteine change at a highly conserved residue in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) as a major determinant of blond hair in Solomon Islanders. This missense mutation is predicted to affect catalytic activity of TYRP1 and causes blond hair through a recessive mode of inheritance. The mutation is at a frequency of 26% in the Solomon Islands, is absent outside of Oceania, represents a strong common genetic effect on a complex human phenotype, and highlights the importance of examining genetic associations worldwide.	 11127900 21771715 12140685 14551921 1303241 8601447 8651291 9345097 9585436 16396172 16219788 16374866 16923821 17999355 17952075 18208337 18488028 18771588 19297406 19667188 19659755 20178767 20354512 20445093 20418488 21378987 20978532 21940856 21944045 11954565

These include OCA2-HERC2 (combined P = 3.80 × 10(-8)), MC1R (P = 1.82 × 10(-13)), a region near TYR (P = 1.57 × 10(-13)), IFIH1 (P = 4.91 × 10(-15)), CD80 (P = 3.78 × 10(-10)), CLNK (P = 1.56 × 10(-8)), BACH2 (P = 2.53 × 10(-8)), SLA (P = 1.58 × 10(-8)), CASP7 (P = 3.56 × 10(-8)), CD44 (P = 1.78 × 10(-9)), IKZF4 (P = 2.75 × 10(-14)), SH2B3 (P = 3.54 × 10(-18)) and TOB2 (P = 6.81 × 10(-10)). Most vitiligo susceptibility loci encode immunoregulatory proteins or melanocyte components that likely mediate immune targeting and the relationships among vitiligo, melanoma, and eye, skin and hair coloration.	 20526340 19909366 18252222 17250545 18650849 18198356 18978792 17304515 16862161 21331226 15541653 17952075 21926416 20190752 7545666 22402439 20596022 19696312 19782763 19120474 18311140 16625202 21437871 12917167 20508602 19073967 18840781 12753387 16699517 21102463 21085187 15889046 15297300 21723852 14679087 3468804 17535987 10949928 18172690 17504820 11279502 19648290 21058334 15242677 20959028 11719435 17236130 17701901 8627164 20668468 18285833 21167468 8421497 21749400 831622 19838195 20410501 18252221 21045058

22566498	Genomic association analysis identifies multiple loci influencing antihypertensive response to an angiotensin II receptor blocker.	To identify genes influencing blood pressure response to an angiotensin II receptor blocker, single nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association analysis of the response to candesartan were validated by opposite direction associations with the response to a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. We sampled 198 white and 193 blacks with primary hypertension from opposite tertiles of the race-sex-specific distributions of age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure response to candesartan. There were 285 polymorphisms associated with the response to candesartan at P<10(-4) in whites. A total of 273 of the 285 polymorphisms, which were available for analysis in a separate sample of 196 whites, validated for opposite direction associations with the response to hydrochlorothiazide (Fisher χ(2) 1-sided P=0.02). Among the 273 polymorphisms, those in the chromosome 11q21 region were the most significantly associated with response to candesartan in whites (eg, rs11020821 near FUT4, P=8.98 × 10(-7)), had the strongest opposite direction associations with response to hydrochlorothiazide (eg, rs3758785 in GPR83, P=7.10 × 10(-3)), and had the same direction associations with response to candesartan in the 193 blacks (eg, rs16924603 near FUT4, P=1.52 × 10(-2)). Also notable among the 273 polymorphisms was rs11649420 on chromosome 16 in the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel subunit SCNN1G involved in mediating renal sodium reabsorption and maintaining blood pressure when the renin-angiotensin system is inhibited by candesartan. These results support the use of genomewide association analyses to identify novel genes predictive of opposite direction associations with blood pressure responses to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin and renal sodium transport systems.	 10527851 9777817 15683583 15942450 16080804 16172412 17531119 17903302 18091745 20725057 20798254 21171650 21309757 21269061 21938070 15543147 8801636 11060465 11204288 11593098 11849460 11991710 12022239 12065207 12359989 12544508 18398418 18591461 18650507 20725055 12623934 14553962 14504849 4371298 2857912 3049337 7550319
22566624	Genome-wide association and functional studies identify the DOT1L gene to be involved in cartilage thickness and hip osteoarthritis.	Hip osteoarthritis (HOA) is one of the most disabling and common joint disorders with a large genetic component that is, however, still ill-defined. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in osteoarthritis (OA) and specifically in HOA have yielded only few loci, which is partly explained by heterogeneity in the OA definition. Therefore, we here focused on radiographically measured joint-space width (JSW), a proxy for cartilage thickness and an important underlying intermediate trait for HOA. In a GWAS of 6,523 individuals on hip-JSW, we identified the G allele of rs12982744 on chromosome 19p13.3 to be associated with a 5% larger JSW (P = 4.8 × 10(-10)). The association was replicated in 4,442 individuals from three United Kingdom cohorts with an overall meta-analysis P value of 1.1 × 10(-11). The SNP was also strongly associated with a 12% reduced risk for HOA (P = 1 × 10(-4)). The SNP is located in the DOT1L gene, which is an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase, recently identified as a potentially dedicated enzyme for Wnt target-gene activation in leukemia. Immunohistochemical staining of the DOT1L protein in mouse limbs supports a role for DOT1L in chondrogenic differentiation and adult articular cartilage. DOT1L is also expressed in OA articular chondrocytes. Silencing of Dot1l inhibited chondrogenesis in vitro. Dot1l knockdown reduces proteoglycan and collagen content, and mineralization during chondrogenesis. In the ATDC5 chondrogenesis model system, DOT1L interacts with TCF and Wnt signaling. These data are a further step to better understand the role of Wnt-signaling during chondrogenesis and cartilage homeostasis. DOT1L may represent a therapeutic target for OA.	 10817550 19543373 11048620 11239392 11846608 14698640 14962953 14872406 2201423 7763102 8589725 9755194 9783760 15371351 17384641 17517696 17704066 18455228 18787701 19266077 19136083 19181678 18625619 19700477 19029166 19054821 20112360 20230194 20203130 20495570 20881960 21103407 20798234 21068099 21289070 21059398 21871595 19479880 10913065
22566634	The genetic architecture of economic and political preferences.	Preferences are fundamental building blocks in all models of economic and political behavior. We study a new sample of comprehensively genotyped subjects with data on economic and political preferences and educational attainment. We use dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to estimate the proportion of variation in these traits explained by common SNPs and to conduct genome-wide association study (GWAS) and prediction analyses. The pattern of results is consistent with findings for other complex traits. First, the estimated fraction of phenotypic variation that could, in principle, be explained by dense SNP arrays is around one-half of the narrow heritability estimated using twin and family samples. The molecular-genetic-based heritability estimates, therefore, partially corroborate evidence of significant heritability from behavior genetic studies. Second, our analyses suggest that these traits have a polygenic architecture, with the heritable variation explained by many genes with small effects. Our results suggest that most published genetic association studies with economic and political traits are dramatically underpowered, which implies a high false discovery rate. These results convey a cautionary message for whether, how, and how soon molecular genetic data can contribute to, and potentially transform, research in social science. We propose some constructive responses to the inferential challenges posed by the small explanatory power of individual SNPs.	 20418890 11315092 21928046 17266119 20562875 22223662 19412359 19217678 22344220 21890791 21552263 22427719 21845928 20183907 20881960 18349094 21612000 18398418 21376301 16565746 17032067 23012269 21173776 3459179 21142928 23482589 19580554 21826061 17551261 7425434 22832902 21307931 19812666 4857324 18443579 21407268 21226974 11682798 21167468 19571811 19210185 20346758 12689998
22589742	Genome-wide association of pericardial fat identifies a unique locus for ectopic fat.	Pericardial fat is a localized fat depot associated with coronary artery calcium and myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that genetic loci would be associated with pericardial fat independent of other body fat depots. Pericardial fat was quantified in 5,487 individuals of European ancestry from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Genotyping was performed using standard arrays and imputed to ~2.5 million Hapmap SNPs. Each study performed a genome-wide association analysis of pericardial fat adjusted for age, sex, weight, and height. A weighted z-score meta-analysis was conducted, and validation was obtained in an additional 3,602 multi-ethnic individuals from the MESA study. We identified a genome-wide significant signal in our primary meta-analysis at rs10198628 near TRIB2 (MAF 0.49, p = 2.7 × 10(-08)). This SNP was not associated with visceral fat (p = 0.17) or body mass index (p = 0.38), although we observed direction-consistent, nominal significance with visceral fat adjusted for BMI (p = 0.01) in the Framingham Heart Study. Our findings were robust among African ancestry (n = 1,442, p = 0.001), Hispanic (n = 1,399, p = 0.004), and Chinese (n = 761, p = 0.007) participants from the MESA study, with a combined p-value of 5.4E-14. We observed TRIB2 gene expression in the pericardial fat of mice. rs10198628 near TRIB2 is associated with pericardial fat but not measures of generalized or visceral adiposity, reinforcing the concept that there are unique genetic underpinnings to ectopic fat distribution.	 20502693 12355400 18367736 17873877 17372189 20123228 16862161 7812414 21706003 18212276 20937770 17576771 21653610 18344981 16054046 21947291 18497449 18591397 19128478 16154575 19654370 18193047 18462017 12397006 12883005 19136488 21399661 20616382 20935630 20935629 21378990 16953256 18535554 9545414 19644074 17873875 16024563 19222302 17576866 20410507 18952906 15592488 16195477 21602305 19289634 18348202 19571212 19361613 21828341 17873874 1773700 21129726 19543373 19966804 21423719 14819398 20522600
22589738	Genome-wide association for abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose reveals a novel locus for visceral fat in women.	Body fat distribution, particularly centralized obesity, is associated with metabolic risk above and beyond total adiposity. We performed genome-wide association of abdominal adipose depots quantified using computed tomography (CT) to uncover novel loci for body fat distribution among participants of European ancestry. Subcutaneous and visceral fat were quantified in 5,560 women and 4,997 men from 4 population-based studies. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using standard arrays and imputed to ~2.5 million Hapmap SNPs. Each study performed a genome-wide association analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), VAT adjusted for body mass index, and VAT/SAT ratio (a metric of the propensity to store fat viscerally as compared to subcutaneously) in the overall sample and in women and men separately. A weighted z-score meta-analysis was conducted. For the VAT/SAT ratio, our most significant p-value was rs11118316 at LYPLAL1 gene (p = 3.1 × 10E-09), previously identified in association with waist-hip ratio. For SAT, the most significant SNP was in the FTO gene (p = 5.9 × 10E-08). Given the known gender differences in body fat distribution, we performed sex-specific analyses. Our most significant finding was for VAT in women, rs1659258 near THNSL2 (p = 1.6 × 10-08), but not men (p = 0.75). Validation of this SNP in the GIANT consortium data demonstrated a similar sex-specific pattern, with observed significance in women (p = 0.006) but not men (p = 0.24) for BMI and waist circumference (p = 0.04 [women], p = 0.49 [men]). Finally, we interrogated our data for the 14 recently published loci for body fat distribution (measured by waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI); associations were observed at 7 of these loci. In contrast, we observed associations at only 7/32 loci previously identified in association with BMI; the majority of overlap was observed with SAT. Genome-wide association for visceral and subcutaneous fat revealed a SNP for VAT in women. More refined phenotypes for body composition and fat distribution can detect new loci not previously uncovered in large-scale GWAS of anthropometric traits.	 21228245 18974276 20502693 17873877 17372189 16862161 15618373 8630661 7812414 8419667 6437507 21706003 18212276 10595643 19197254 1669488 2882231 18344981 10857936 19128478 21299892 9098178 19557197 9622340 19654370 18193047 10902782 15111512 18462017 20686565 17609260 21123445 8275203 20616382 21397319 20935630 20935629 18839131 14514631 8941472 16953256 17709633 8651220 9569171 19005195 9846779 20065971 9545414 11607880 19644074 17873875 6426576 8491156 19222302 17576866 11534030 8621015 7771450 21602305 18348202 19571212 19361613 17873874 1400882 11397704 10189485 21129726 19966804 21423719 14819398 11441231 21674055
22581228	A genome-wide approach accounting for body mass index identifies genetic variants influencing fasting glycemic traits and insulin resistance.	Recent genome-wide association studies have described many loci implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology and β-cell dysfunction but have contributed little to the understanding of the genetic basis of insulin resistance. We hypothesized that genes implicated in insulin resistance pathways might be uncovered by accounting for differences in body mass index (BMI) and potential interactions between BMI and genetic variants. We applied a joint meta-analysis approach to test associations with fasting insulin and glucose on a genome-wide scale. We present six previously unknown loci associated with fasting insulin at P < 5 × 10(-8) in combined discovery and follow-up analyses of 52 studies comprising up to 96,496 non-diabetic individuals. Risk variants were associated with higher triglyceride and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, suggesting a role for these loci in insulin resistance pathways. The discovery of these loci will aid further characterization of the role of insulin resistance in T2D pathophysiology.	 20864672 20839289 20724581 20935629 20935630 18462017 18504548 18498634 18426862 18604207 19056611 19543373 19557161 19715440 19734900 19759537 19924153 19956259 20031564 19820914 20081857 20081858 20233392 20360734 20581827 20686565 20881960 20981092 21091714 21058334 20703240 20858683 21181894 21304890 21300955 21336532 21589913 21873549 9326926 9609109 9822378 9887102 16246733 16415888 16468122 10988299 11337480 11343120 11804590 12045153 12111919 12598536 12771153 12970316 14512015 14764823 15057233 15046636 15154973 3899825 2646917 7479769 8666140 8717357 16823477 17167471 17056740 17283440 17293876 17213274 17495182 17572673 17634449 17673620 17549752 17846126
22584459	Possible association of CUX1 gene polymorphisms with antidepressant response in major depressive disorder.	Association between response to antidepressant treatment and genetic polymorphisms was examined in two independent Japanese samples of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Genome-wide approach using the Illumina Human CNV370-quad Bead Chip was utilized in the analysis of the 92 MDD patients in the first sample. In all, 11 non-intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms with uncorrected allelic P-value <0.0001 were selected for the subsequent association analyses in the second sample of 136 MDD patients. Difference in allele distribution between responders and nonresponders were found in the second-stage sample for rs365836 and rs201522 of the CUX1 gene (P=0.005 and 0.004, respectively). The allelic P-values for rs365836 and rs201522 in both samples combined were 0.0000023 and 0.0000040, respectively. Our results provide the first evidence that polymorphisms of the CUX1 gene may be associated with response to antidepressant treatment in Japanese patients with MDD.

22832960	A genome-wide meta-analysis of association studies of Cloninger's Temperament Scales.	Temperament has a strongly heritable component, yet multiple independent genome-wide studies have failed to identify significant genetic associations. We have assembled the largest sample to date of persons with genome-wide genotype data, who have been assessed with Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory. Sum scores for novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence and persistence have been measured in over 11,000 persons collected in four different cohorts. Our study had >80% power to identify genome-wide significant loci (P<1.25 × 10(-8), with correction for testing four scales) accounting for ≥0.4% of the phenotypic variance in temperament scales. Using meta-analysis techniques, gene-based tests and pathway analysis we have tested over 1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association to each of the four temperament dimensions. We did not discover any SNPs, genes, or pathways to be significantly related to the four temperament dimensions, after correcting for multiple testing. Less than 1% of the variability in any temperament dimension appears to be accounted for by a risk score derived from the SNPs showing strongest association to the temperament dimensions. Elucidation of genetic loci significantly influencing temperament and personality will require potentially very large samples, and/or a more refined phenotype. Item response theory methodology may be a way to incorporate data from cohorts assessed with multiple personality instruments, and might be a method by which a large sample of a more refined phenotype could be acquired.	 11315092 21173776 12668349 15233716 15318029 4911003 3809156 3579504 2036203 8250684 8189351 8558406 9674977 15738498 16251536 16273321 16442638 16862161 17096117 17284500 17534709 17701901 17924335 18378874 18263651 19060910 18546120 19539821 19748081 20233392 20598278 20691247 19430479 20940738 20881960 21058334 12399947
22832961	Genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease.	In addition to apolipoprotein E (APOE), recent large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified nine other genes/loci (CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7) for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, the genetic effect attributable to known loci is about 50%, indicating that additional risk genes for LOAD remain to be identified. In this study, we have used a new GWAS data set from the University of Pittsburgh (1291 cases and 938 controls) to examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and also performed a meta-analysis utilizing the top 1% GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P<0.01 along with four independent data sets (2727 cases and 3336 controls) for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci. The new GWAS data were generated on the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip and imputed at ~2.5 million markers. As expected, several markers in the APOE regions showed genome-wide significant associations in the Pittsburg sample. While we observed nominal significant associations (P<0.05) either within or adjacent to five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1), significant signals were observed 69-180 kb outside of the remaining four genes (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1). Meta-analysis on the top 1% SNPs revealed a suggestive novel association in the PPP1R3B gene (top SNP rs3848140 with P = 3.05E-07). The association of this SNP with AD risk was consistent in all five samples with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 2.43. This is a potential candidate gene for AD as this is expressed in the brain and is involved in lipid metabolism. These findings need to be confirmed in additional samples.	 20451872 21460841 19136949 17317784 11252006 17474819 18976728 16461860 20864672 20209083 22323736 20686565 20887790 19118814 19734902 12958120 2810583 21702018 21460840 19734903 20451875 20460622 7544443 17701901 20042704 17998437 18823527 7772075 17553421
22610502	Genome-wide analysis of polymorphisms associated with cytokine responses in smallpox vaccine recipients.	The role that genetics play in response to infection or disease is becoming increasingly clear as we learn more about immunogenetics and host-pathogen interactions. Here we report a genome-wide analysis of the effects of host genetic variation on cytokine responses to vaccinia virus stimulation in smallpox vaccine recipients. Our data show that vaccinia stimulation of immune individuals results in secretion of inflammatory and Th1 cytokines. We identified multiple SNPs significantly associated with variations in cytokine secretion. These SNPs are found in genes with known immune function, as well as in genes encoding for proteins involved in signal transduction, cytoskeleton, membrane channels and ion transport, as well as others with no previously identified connection to immune responses. The large number of significant SNP associations implies that cytokine secretion in response to vaccinia virus is a complex process controlled by multiple genes and gene families. Follow-up studies to replicate these findings and then pursue mechanistic studies will provide a greater understanding of how genetic variation influences vaccine responses.	 21958369 21742843 1350676 8363277 7758109 7608155 8616890 8699112 8794356 9314355 10211965 10458613 10482239 15564041 15712014 16286015 16546102 16574867 16581827 16862161 17186465 17336617 17382889 10570190 10605032 10769064 10835412 11124948 11878931 11923489 12388820 12446452 12856218 12941906 12925846 13129976 14607890 15184506 15220000 2685955 2557615 17785829 17889291 18204446 18429179 18465770 18615110 19180478 19038260 19225526 19369349 19524427 19535540 19644876 19729181 20109744 19796918 20116071 21242513 21163947 20861858 2219722
22832964	Genome-wide meta-analyses of smoking behaviors in African Americans.	The identification and exploration of genetic loci that influence smoking behaviors have been conducted primarily in populations of the European ancestry. Here we report results of the first genome-wide association study meta-analysis of smoking behavior in African Americans in the Study of Tobacco in Minority Populations Genetics Consortium (n = 32,389). We identified one non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2036527[A]) on chromosome 15q25.1 associated with smoking quantity (cigarettes per day), which exceeded genome-wide significance (β = 0.040, s.e. = 0.007, P = 1.84 × 10(-8)). This variant is present in the 5'-distal enhancer region of the CHRNA5 gene and defines the primary index signal reported in studies of the European ancestry. No other SNP reached genome-wide significance for smoking initiation (SI, ever vs never smoking), age of SI, or smoking cessation (SC, former vs current smoking). Informative associations that approached genome-wide significance included three modestly correlated variants, at 15q25.1 within PSMA4, CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 for smoking quantity, which are associated with a second signal previously reported in studies in European ancestry populations, and a signal represented by three SNPs in the SPOCK2 gene on chr10q22.1. The association at 15q25.1 confirms this region as an important susceptibility locus for smoking quantity in men and women of African ancestry. Larger studies will be needed to validate the suggestive loci that did not reach genome-wide significance and further elucidate the contribution of genetic variation to disparities in cigarette consumption, SC and smoking-attributable disease between African Americans and European Americans.	 11002906 20395969 12796232 14678060 14704198 15048647 15188804 15500307 7198250 6543277 2392895 9489045 16228001 21338875 21330593 21278726 20517342 21814258 21546441 21836138 21764527 16436765 16532393 16611469 16685642 16862161 16960812 17047687 16847025 17393944 17161559 17564960 17194218 17786212 17924348 17943122 18385738 18385739 18385676 18852200 19008790 18850115 19200528 20418888 20418889 20418890 20584212 20700147 12492752 19279237 19300303 19543373 19715440 19706762 19812666 19896728 20123949 10617315
22633400	Genome-wide association study identifies candidate genes for male fertility traits in humans.	Despite the fact that hundreds of genes are known to affect fertility in animal models, relatively little is known about genes that influence natural fertility in humans. To broadly survey genes contributing to variation in male fertility, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of two fertility traits (family size and birth rate) in 269 married men who are members of a founder population of European descent that proscribes contraception and has large family sizes. Associations between ∼250,000 autosomal SNPs and the fertility traits were examined. A total of 41 SNPs with p ≤ 1 × 10(-4) for either trait were taken forward to a validation study of 123 ethnically diverse men from Chicago who had previously undergone semen analyses. Nine (22%) of the SNPs associated with reduced fertility in the GWAS were also associated with one or more of the ten measures of reduced sperm quantity and/or function, yielding 27 associations with p values < 0.05 and seven with p values < 0.01 in the validation study. On the basis of 5,000 permutations of our data, the probabilities of observing this many or more small p values were 0.0014 and 5.6 × 10(-4), respectively. Among the nine associated loci, outstanding candidates for male fertility genes include USP8, an essential deubiquitinating enzyme that has a role in acrosome assembly; UBD and EPSTI1, which have potential roles in innate immunity; and LRRC32, which encodes a latent transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor on regulatory T cells. We suggest that mutations in these genes that are more severe may account for some of the unexplained infertility (or subfertility) in the general population.	 20130268 20418328 20532200 21184853 21382200 21212097 22460724 10712219 11102707 11111860 11549697 11880950 11897813 11991720 12360237 12475548 12479614 12552574 12558529 12609522 12721954 12721957 15672592 16129933 16466526 16472941 16769699 16929659 17071710 17452457 17688597 17868458 12778326 14535856 15066457 15149402 15136966 5473413 5507462 2985059 3104098 1729895 9512225 9634505 9844029 9915962 10213317 10411917 14167587 15371359 18311719 18403759 18574467 18989307 18791147 19124843 18789839 19488966 19640321 19651619 19811461 19750484 19808075 19822755 19959714 19941288
22628157	Genome-wide association study of neurocognitive impairment and dementia in HIV-infected adults.	The neuropathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is unclear. Candidate gene studies have implicated genetic susceptibility loci within immune-related genes; however, these have not been reliably validated. Here, we employed genome-wide association (GWA) methods to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci associated with HAND, and validate susceptibility loci implicated in prior candidate gene studies. Data from 1,287 participants enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 1985 and 2010 were used. Genotyping was conducted with Illumina 1M, 1MDuo, or 550K platform. Linear mixed models determined subject-specific slopes for change over time in processing speed and executive functioning, considering all visits including baseline and the most recent study visit. Covariates modeled as fixed effects included: time since the first visit, depression severity, nadir CD4+ T-cell count, hepatitis C co-infection, substance use, and antiretroviral medication regimen. Prevalence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) was also examined as neurocognitive phenotypes in a case-control analysis. No genetic susceptibility loci were associated with decline in processing speed or executive functioning among almost 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly genotyped or imputed. No association between the SNPs and HAD or NCI were found. Previously reported associations between specific genetic susceptibility loci, HIV-associated NCI, and HAD were not validated. In this first GWAS of HAND, no novel or previously identified genetic susceptibility loci were associated with any of the phenotypes examined. Due to the relatively small sample size, future collaborative efforts that incorporate this dataset may still yield important findings.	 18668226 15075493 19840555 11315092 9484360 18297762 19462243 18264751 18195140 16862161 19951441 10219738 12824792 10438379 9771753 19656122 19115126 20299964 18808989 17943122 20097875 16868439 16448974 18179394 9100666 17721099 20413850 21221856 13880724 15075495 8839616 15686610 21184197 18681187 9188909 19424802 12374865 15579274 16249037 15579296 18240059 2046917 15075502 15579298 3729308 16682686 15608521 18240062 22347417 21229435 10714569 16036806 20404173 19468837 15851720 11564589 14751002 17226745 20149939 19661443 20233392 16549972 20175693 1766784 21058334 15579287 18562290 19697136 11838534 16055767 10575135 14624371 12394784 17924348 21543606 21803164 11506397 18631256 20460622 21135382 17701901 15370374 20442634 20725607 17641165 15579206 17065128 21174240 21132329 11867661 9266156 16260385 17550370 2405289 15624762 14982742 10931369 17914061 8290553
22634755	Common variation near CDKN1A, POLD3 and SHROOM2 influences colorectal cancer risk.	We performed a meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies to identify common variants influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk comprising 8,682 cases and 9,649 controls. Replication analysis was performed in case-control sets totaling 21,096 cases and 19,555 controls. We identified three new CRC risk loci at 6p21 (rs1321311, near CDKN1A; P = 1.14 × 10(-10)), 11q13.4 (rs3824999, intronic to POLD3; P = 3.65 × 10(-10)) and Xp22.2 (rs5934683, near SHROOM2; P = 7.30 × 10(-10)) This brings the number of independent loci associated with CRC risk to 20 and provides further insight into the genetic architecture of inherited susceptibility to CRC.	 12111919 12029063 8956794 9002677 9823339 15543147 15937084 16124854 16224025 15879497 16381825 16362079 16987870 17200375 1325301 10891514 17289997 17148480 17384679 17586828 17850631 17934461 18084292 18372901 18372905 18441336 19011631 19307499 19440234 19644074 20062063 20028993 19434079 20972440 20952405 21304890 21248203 21655089 17701901
22637743	Genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis for asbestos exposure in lung cancer susceptibility.	Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted genome-wide gene-environment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was 2.17×10(-6), which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90×10(-5)). Interestingly, most of the other significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that  the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.	 19239902 15272419 16199517 19474294 20849352 10592173 20018080 21085203 19022827 20460509 18453631 18385676 20716278 18978787 21072972 16798876 15573121 17966091 18420450 19223589 19924704 18364247 20581827 19584899 21182195 17166401 21102463 11720745 20442747 17764616 20598278 20435672 19767753 12111688 20377990 20053841 20068227 17554300 19812666 14998741 19304273 19822075 17701901 18757527 11048730 10802651 20634813 18641646 16723503 17350453
22666496	Genome-wide study of gene variants associated with differential cardiovascular event reduction by pravastatin therapy.	Statin therapy reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), however, the person-to-person variability in response to statin therapy is not well understood. We have investigated the effect of genetic variation on the reduction of CHD events by pravastatin. First, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 682 CHD cases from the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial and 383 CHD cases from the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), two randomized, placebo-controlled studies of pravastatin. In a combined case-only analysis, 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with differential CHD event reduction by pravastatin according to genotype (P<0.0001), and these SNPs were analyzed in a second stage that included cases as well as non-cases from CARE and WOSCOPS and patients from the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk/PHArmacogenomic study of Statins in the Elderly at risk for cardiovascular disease (PROSPER/PHASE), a randomized placebo controlled study of pravastatin in the elderly. We found that one of these SNPs (rs13279522) was associated with differential CHD event reduction by pravastatin therapy in all 3 studies: P = 0.002 in CARE, P = 0.01 in WOSCOPS, P = 0.002 in PROSPER/PHASE. In a combined analysis of CARE, WOSCOPS, and PROSPER/PHASE, the hazard ratio for CHD when comparing pravastatin with placebo decreased by a factor of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.75) for each extra copy of the minor allele (P = 4.8 × 10(-7)). This SNP is located in DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 5B (DNAJC5B) and merits investigation in additional randomized studies of pravastatin and other statins.	 7566020 15273956 15811254 16175505 16214597 16103896 16952052 16550210 17701901 18068482 18222353 18222355 18332269 20031551 20031582 20173735 20403483 20453918 20499929 20215968 21458191 21493817 22216121 12457784 12956868 15199031 8801446
22658931	A genome-wide association study of host genetic determinants of the antibody response to Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed.	Several lines of evidence have supported a host genetic contribution to vaccine response, but genome-wide assessments for specific determinants have been sparse. Here we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of protective antigen-specific antibody (AbPA) responses among 726 European-Americans who received Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) as part of a clinical trial. After quality control, 736,996 SNPs were tested for association with the AbPA response to 3 or 4 AVA vaccinations given over a 6-month period. No SNP achieved the threshold of genome-wide significance (p=5 × 10(-8)), but suggestive associations (p<1 × 10(-5)) were observed for SNPs in or near the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), in the promoter region of SPSB1, and adjacent to MEX3C. Multivariable regression modeling suggested that much of the association signal within the MHC corresponded to previously identified HLA DR-DQ haplotypes involving component HLA-DRB1 alleles of *15:01, *01:01, or *01:02. We estimated the proportion of additive genetic variance explained by common SNP variation for the AbPA response after the 6 month vaccination. This analysis indicated a significant, albeit imprecisely estimated, contribution of variation tagged by common polymorphisms (p=0.032).

22648509	PKNOX2 is associated with formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies.	Formal thought disorder (FTD), or disorganized speech, is one of the central signs of schizophrenia; however, little is known about the etiology of FTD. To identify new genetic loci associated with FTD, we conducted the first genome-wide association meta-analysis of two datasets of 835 cases of FTD and 2,694 controls with 729,454 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Logistic regression analysis of FTD as a binary trait, adjusted for age and sex, was performed using PLINK. For meta-analysis of two datasets, the fixed-effect model in PLINK was applied. Through meta-analysis we identified 61 SNPs associated with FTD with p < 10(-4). The most significant association with FTD was observed with rs1783925 (p = 4.4 × 10(-7)) within PKNOX2 gene at 11q24.2 while the second interesting locus was rs2277644 (p = 1.18 × 10(-5)) within MYH13 at 17p13. Haplotype analyses of PKNOX2 and MYH13 loci further supported the associations with FTD. The third locus was PHF2 at 9q22.31 (the top SNP was rs12238738 with p = 2.08 × 10(-5)) while the fourth locus was GPC6 at 13q32 (the top SNP was rs17196161 with p = 3.12 × 10(-5)). In conclusion, we identified four new loci (PKNOX2, MYH13, PHF2, and GPC6) associated with FTD. These findings offer the potential for new insights into the pathogenesis of FTD and schizophrenia.	 19571809 16862161 16581030 19481194 19632097 19414483 18023149 18830724 20485477 20161689 20649982 19150704 19567891 16618939 21663442 18987363 11153540 20634892 21703634 11549286 11972344 20159339 15297300 10480909 18198266 19251251 20202923 12003444 19367784 17554300 17701901 20200835 7499477 19345090 4038986 19538905 19716272 18450176 21298047 10051327 9435762 16936715 20889312 10388558
22693455	Stratifying type 2 diabetes cases by BMI identifies genetic risk variants in LAMA1 and enrichment for risk variants in lean compared to obese cases.	Common diseases such as type 2 diabetes are phenotypically heterogeneous. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but patients vary appreciably in body mass index. We hypothesized that the genetic predisposition to the disease may be different in lean (BMI<25 Kg/m²) compared to obese cases (BMI≥30 Kg/m²). We performed two case-control genome-wide studies using two accepted cut-offs for defining individuals as overweight or obese. We used 2,112 lean type 2 diabetes cases (BMI<25 kg/m²) or 4,123 obese cases (BMI≥30 kg/m²), and 54,412 un-stratified controls. Replication was performed in 2,881 lean cases or 8,702 obese cases, and 18,957 un-stratified controls. To assess the effects of known signals, we tested the individual and combined effects of SNPs representing 36 type 2 diabetes loci. After combining data from discovery and replication datasets, we identified two signals not previously reported in Europeans. A variant (rs8090011) in the LAMA1 gene was associated with type 2 diabetes in lean cases (P = 8.4×10⁻⁹, OR = 1.13 [95% CI 1.09-1.18]), and this association was stronger than that in obese cases (P = 0.04, OR = 1.03 [95% CI 1.00-1.06]). A variant in HMG20A--previously identified in South Asians but not Europeans--was associated with type 2 diabetes in obese cases (P = 1.3×10⁻⁸, OR = 1.11 [95% CI 1.07-1.15]), although this association was not significantly stronger than that in lean cases (P = 0.02, OR = 1.09 [95% CI 1.02-1.17]). For 36 known type 2 diabetes loci, 29 had a larger odds ratio in the lean compared to obese (binomial P = 0.0002). In the lean analysis, we observed a weighted per-risk allele OR = 1.13 [95% CI 1.10-1.17], P = 3.2×10⁻¹⁴. This was larger than the same model fitted in the obese analysis where the OR = 1.06 [95% CI 1.05-1.08], P = 2.2×10⁻¹⁶. This study provides evidence that stratification of type 2 diabetes cases by BMI may help identify additional risk variants and that lean cases may have a stronger genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.	 21874001 20502693 20858683 20818381 11553521 10884429 17873877 18498634 19060908 20372150 20862305 18239663 20418489 15480796 18344981 16885550 19128478 21308769 19654370 18193047 21565292 18462017 19060907 20581827 19056611 20935630 21484216 21637794 10102687 9892237 15913604 19933169 16537450 12882917 19644074 17873875 19222302 9836521 21602305 11471545 19361613 21186350 17873874 21226949 21129726 20081857 20174558 19966804 20081858
22693459	Six novel susceptibility Loci for early-onset androgenetic alopecia and their unexpected association with common diseases.	Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a highly heritable condition and the most common form of hair loss in humans. Susceptibility loci have been described on the X chromosome and chromosome 20, but these loci explain a minority of its heritable variance. We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of seven genome-wide association studies for early-onset AGA in 12,806 individuals of European ancestry. While replicating the two AGA loci on the X chromosome and chromosome 20, six novel susceptibility loci reached genome-wide significance (p = 2.62×10⁻⁹-1.01×10⁻¹²). Unexpectedly, we identified a risk allele at 17q21.31 that was recently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) at a genome-wide significant level. We then tested the association between early-onset AGA and the risk of PD in a cross-sectional analysis of 568 PD cases and 7,664 controls. Early-onset AGA cases had significantly increased odds of subsequent PD (OR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.55, p = 8.9×10⁻³). Further, the AGA susceptibility alleles at the 17q21.31 locus are on the H1 haplotype, which is under negative selection in Europeans and has been linked to decreased fertility. Combining the risk alleles of six novel and two established susceptibility loci, we created a genotype risk score and tested its association with AGA in an additional sample. Individuals in the highest risk quartile of a genotype score had an approximately six-fold increased risk of early-onset AGA [odds ratio (OR) = 5.78, p = 1.4×10⁻⁸⁸]. Our results highlight unexpected associations between early-onset AGA, Parkinson's disease, and decreased fertility, providing important insights into the pathophysiology of these conditions.	 10577638 14499208 11533236 12050096 12058088 12590135 12777365 12790784 14585162 14576337 14974761 15036687 15082523 15293277 15365985 3992076 7849715 9920059 14819896 15654335 15824176 15761122 16467259 16494531 16434451 16713924 16001449 16983374 17136762 17572673 17694086 17721441 17943122 17885209 18172174 18849991 18849994 19680443 19837873 19915575 19837719 20070850 20206591 20385334 20562874 20509871 20609350 20711177 21058334 20943813 20561779 21044948 21292315 21378988 21151173 21471458 21541972 21602798 21738487 21324955 21610748 10624470
22675492	Genome-wide association study of circulating estradiol, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin in postmenopausal women.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk. Discovering additional variants has become difficult, as power to detect variants of weaker effect with present sample sizes is limited. An alternative approach is to look for variants associated with quantitative traits that in turn affect disease risk. As exposure to high circulating estradiol and testosterone, and low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels is implicated in breast cancer etiology, we conducted GWAS analyses of plasma estradiol, testosterone, and SHBG to identify new susceptibility alleles. Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and Sisters in Breast Cancer Screening data were used to carry out primary meta-analyses among ~1600 postmenopausal women who were not taking postmenopausal hormones at blood draw. We observed a genome-wide significant association between SHBG levels and rs727428 (joint β = -0.126; joint P = 2.09 × 10(-16)), downstream of the SHBG gene. No genome-wide significant associations were observed with estradiol or testosterone levels. Among variants that were suggestively associated with estradiol (P<10(-5)), several were located at the CYP19A1 gene locus. Overall results were similar in secondary meta-analyses that included ~900 NHS current postmenopausal hormone users. No variant associated with estradiol, testosterone, or SHBG at P<10(-5) was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk among CGEMS participants. Our results suggest that the small magnitude of difference in hormone levels associated with common genetic variants is likely insufficient to detectably contribute to breast cancer risk.	 10720042 21998597 11250676 11705483 11897502 11959894 11984562 12185669 12928347 14710223 15199113 3815384 3605058 2626050 1496995 8547832 8656904 9731736 15557796 15601642 15634719 16322344 16278609 16862161 16917136 17113977 17325027 17529973 17924335 18464913 18637490 19064566 19190634 19715440 19657112 19850695 20233392 20616382 20634197 20881960 21058334 21102462 21177793 21263130 20872241 21752884 10891514
22664479	A genome-wide association study for irinotecan-related severe toxicities in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.	The identification of patients who are at high risk for irinotecan-related severe diarrhea and neutropenia is clinically important. We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for novel susceptibility genes for irinotecan-related severe toxicities, such as diarrhea and neutropenia, in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with irinotecan chemotherapy. The GWAS putatively identified 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with grade 3 diarrhea (G3D) and 32 SNPs associated with grade 4 neutropenia (G4N). In the replication series, the SNPs rs1517114 (C8orf34), rs1661167 (FLJ41856) and rs2745761 (PLCB1) were confirmed as being associated with G3D, whereas rs11128347 (PDZRN3) and rs11979430 and rs7779029 (SEMAC3) were confirmed as being associated with G4N. The final imputation analysis of our GWAS and replication study showed significant overlaps of association signals within these novel variants. This GWAS screen, along with subsequent validation and imputation analysis, identified novel SNPs associated with irinotecan-related severe toxicities.

22673963	Genome-wide association analysis of circulating vitamin D levels in children with asthma.	Vitamin D deficiency is becoming more apparent in many populations. Genetic factors may play a role in the maintenance of vitamin D levels. The objective of this study was to perform a genome-wide analysis (GWAS) of vitamin D levels, including replication of prior GWAS results. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in serum collected at the time of enrollment and at year 4 in 572 Caucasian children with asthma, who were part of a multi-center clinical trial, the Childhood Asthma Management Program. Replication was performed in a second cohort of 592 asthmatics from Costa Rica and a third cohort of 516 Puerto Rican asthmatics. In addition, we attempted replication of three SNPs that were previously identified in a large GWAS of Caucasian individuals. The setting included data from a clinical trial of childhood asthmatics and two cohorts of asthmatics recruited for genetic studies of asthma. The main outcome measure was circulating 25(OH)D levels. The 25(OH)D levels at the two time-points were only modestly correlated with each other (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.33) in the CAMP population. We identified SNPs that were nominally associated with 25(OH)D levels at two time-points in CAMP, and replicated four SNPs in the Costa Rican cohort: rs11002969, rs163221, rs1678849, and rs4864976. However, these SNPs were not significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels in a third population of Puerto Rican asthmatics. We were able to replicate the SNP with the strongest effect, previously reported in a large GWAS: rs2282679 (GC), and we were able to replicate another SNP, rs10741657 (CYP2R1), to a lesser degree. We were able to replicate two of three prior significant findings in a GWAS of 25(OH)D levels. Other SNPs may be additionally associated with 25(OH)D levels in certain populations.	 12083399 11705562 14730601 15282199 4053351 11204437 19179486 11940068 12081833 8448871 8725743 10027502 10027578 15282200 15585791 15663557 15671234 15651992 15689596 15868450 15872338 16236494 16319673 16529140 16546242 16618499 16766240 16862161 19455578 20043259 20418485 20538327 20541252 20600896 20943799 16896046 16926610 17218096 17561245 17606032 17701901 17701908 17607662 17919705 18199729 18689381 18593774 18030310 14594776
22685421	Genetic variants on chromosome 1q41 influence ocular axial length and high myopia.	As one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness, myopia poses a significant public health burden in Asia. The primary determinant of myopia is an elongated ocular axial length (AL). Here we report a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies on AL conducted in 1,860 Chinese adults, 929 Chinese children, and 2,155 Malay adults. We identified a genetic locus on chromosome 1q41 harboring the zinc-finger 11B pseudogene ZC3H11B showing genome-wide significant association with AL variation (rs4373767, β = -0.16 mm per minor allele, P(meta) =2.69 × 10(-10)). The minor C allele of rs4373767 was also observed to significantly associate with decreased susceptibility to high myopia (per-allele odds ratio (OR) =0.75, 95% CI: 0.68-0.84, P(meta) =4.38 × 10(-7)) in 1,118 highly myopic cases and 5,433 controls. ZC3H11B and two neighboring genes SLC30A10 and LYPLAL1 were expressed in the human neural retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and sclera. In an experimental myopia mouse model, we observed significant alterations to gene and protein expression in the retina and sclera of the unilateral induced myopic eyes for the murine genes ZC3H11A, SLC30A10, and LYPLAL1. This supports the likely role of genetic variants at chromosome 1q41 in influencing AL variation and high myopia.	 21085122 21098505 21095009 21307088 21490949 21541268 21640322 21505071 21695231 21436269 21571680 21807933 21802130 22144915 22150586 12657582 12852489 14527633 15037570 15127929 15154973 15343149 15355597 2853512 8751114 8876223 9021311 10412059 15611866 16101943 16234459 16380590 16138117 16638989 16862161 17197510 17210856 17365815 17701901 17898312 17609260 18289630 18326752 17964656 18408192 18682727 18552384 18852205 18486221 18814308 19365037 19433716 19557161 19779542 19859063 10547847 10937558 10939619 11032785 11179890 11240307 11318236 11328732 11734523 11773038 11952477 19995197 20079928 20577206 20697004 20697017 20835236 20835239 20851442 20935629
22683712	Genome-wide association analysis identifies susceptibility loci for migraine without aura.	Migraine without aura is the most common form of migraine, characterized by recurrent disabling headache and associated autonomic symptoms. To identify common genetic variants associated with this migraine type, we analyzed genome-wide association data of 2,326 clinic-based German and Dutch individuals with migraine without aura and 4,580 population-matched controls. We selected SNPs from 12 loci with 2 or more SNPs associated with P values of <1 × 10(-5) for replication testing in 2,508 individuals with migraine without aura and 2,652 controls. SNPs at two of these loci showed convincing replication: at 1q22 (in MEF2D; replication P = 4.9 × 10(-4); combined P = 7.06 × 10(-11)) and at 3p24 (near TGFBR2; replication P = 1.0 × 10(-4); combined P = 1.17 × 10(-9)). In addition, SNPs at the PHACTR1 and ASTN2 loci showed suggestive evidence of replication (P = 0.01; combined P = 3.20 × 10(-8) and P = 0.02; combined P = 3.86 × 10(-8), respectively). We also replicated associations at two previously reported migraine loci in or near TRPM8 and LRP1. This study identifies the first susceptibility loci for migraine without aura, thereby expanding our knowledge of this debilitating neurological disorder.	 19052139 9013788 19285472 19543373 19689607 11554907 11807151 12111919 14747499 15107502 15456862 3802833 1977102 1310899 8098663 8792035 10433257 10449117 16484497 16643310 16920620 16885183 17381554 17701901 17727472 17786212 17873874 17943122 18025393 18034688 18621663 18626063 19109909 19644074 19812688 20434996 20464611 20573900 20509871 20811451 20802479 21304890 21511950 21666692 21798305 22033344 19198609
22688191	Genome-wide association study in a Swedish population yields support for greater CNV and MHC involvement in schizophrenia compared with bipolar disorder.	Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable psychiatric disorders with overlapping susceptibility loci and symptomatology. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these disorders in a large Swedish sample. We report a new and independent case-control analysis of 1507 SCZ cases, 836 BD cases and 2093 controls. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) achieved significance in these new samples; however, combining new and previously reported SCZ samples (2111 SCZ and 2535 controls) revealed a genome-wide significant association in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (rs886424, P=4.54 × 10(-8)). Imputation using multiple reference panels and meta-analysis with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ results underscored the broad, significant association in the MHC region in the full SCZ sample. We evaluated the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in these subjects. As in prior reports, deletions were enriched in SCZ, but not BD cases compared with controls. Singleton deletions were more frequent in both case groups compared with controls (SCZ: P=0.003, BD: P=0.013), whereas the largest CNVs (>500 kb) were significantly enriched only in SCZ cases (P=0.0035). Two CNVs with previously reported SCZ associations were also overrepresented in this SCZ sample: 16p11.2 duplications (P=0.0035) and 22q11 deletions (P=0.03). These results reinforce prior reports of significant MHC and CNV associations in SCZ, but not BD.	 19150704 18776909 19114987 19488044 19571808 19571809 19571811 19426162 19736351 19855392 19883952 20118450 19954751 20368508 19914906 20502679 20811451 20799338 21055719 21148380 20959866 20157312 21317889 21285140 21353194 21206513 21734685 21791550 21926972 21838734 21946175 22006681 22513993 12395142 14601036 15110730 3053193 15916472 16316898 17122850 17701901 17924348 17486107 18184952 18348202 18369103 18668038 18711365
22700719	Common variation at 6p21.31 (BAK1) influences the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	We performed a meta-analysis of 3 genome-wide association studies to identify additional common variants influencing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk. The discovery phase was composed of genome-wide association study data from 1121 cases and 3745 controls. Replication analysis was performed in 861 cases and 2033 controls. We identified a novel CLL risk locus at 6p21.33 (rs210142; intronic to the BAK1 gene, BCL2 antagonist killer 1; P = 9.47 × 10(-16)). A strong relationship between risk genotype and reduced BAK1 expression was shown in lymphoblastoid cell lines. This finding provides additional support for polygenic inheritance to CLL and provides further insight into the biologic basis of disease development.	 12111919 21554262 15161669 295090 7715730 10477713 16055554 17701901 17895893 18056423 18579814 18715499 18758461 19351886 20062064 20639881 21304890 21131588 14962897

22694956	Genome-wide association study of age-related macular degeneration identifies associated variants in the TNXB-FKBPL-NOTCH4 region of chromosome 6p21.3.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual loss in Western populations. Susceptibility is influenced by age, environmental and genetic factors. Known genetic risk loci do not account for all the heritability. We therefore carried out a genome-wide association study of AMD in the UK population with 893 cases of advanced AMD and 2199 controls. This showed an association with the well-established AMD risk loci ARMS2 (age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2)-HTRA1 (HtrA serine peptidase 1) (P =2.7 × 10(-72)), CFH (complement factor H) (P =2.3 × 10(-47)), C2 (complement component 2)-CFB (complement factor B) (P =5.2 × 10(-9)), C3 (complement component 3) (P =2.2 × 10(-3)) and CFI (P =3.6 × 10(-3)) and with more recently reported risk loci at VEGFA (P =1.2 × 10(-3)) and LIPC (hepatic lipase) (P =0.04). Using a replication sample of 1411 advanced AMD cases and 1431 examined controls, we confirmed a novel association between AMD and single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 6p21.3 at TNXB (tenascin XB)-FKBPL (FK506 binding protein like) [rs12153855/rs9391734; discovery P =4.3 × 10(-7), replication P =3.0 × 10(-4), combined P =1.3 × 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-1.6] and the neighbouring gene NOTCH4 (Notch 4) (rs2071277; discovery P =3.2 × 10(-8), replication P =3.8 × 10(-5), combined P =2.0 × 10(-11), OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2-1.4). These associations remained significant in conditional analyses which included the adjacent C2-CFB locus. TNXB, FKBPL and NOTCH4 are all plausible AMD susceptibility genes, but further research will be needed to identify the causal variants and determine whether any of these genes are involved in the pathogenesis of AMD.	 17554300 11925569 14717632 7604360 15533827 15761120 15761121 15761122 15870199 16080115 16174643 16331473 16518403 16936732 17259973 20177130 19965817 20471686 19430480 20847749 20861866 21144031 21167468 21220632 21364036 21252205 16155052 21428958 21228388 21609220 21394116 21297263 21828089 21665990 22022419 21882290 21989362 17634448 17701901 17767156 18398418 18463380 18550876 18685559 18806297 19255449 19405847 19966805 20089348 20385819 20385826 11315092 11704028 11725972 21868123
22703881	Genetic associations for activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, their gene expression profiles, and risk of coronary artery disease.	Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) are clinical tests commonly used to screen for coagulation-factor deficiencies. One genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been reported previously for aPTT, but no GWAS has been reported for PT. We conducted a GWAS and meta-analysis to identify genetic loci for aPTT and PT. The GWAS for aPTT was conducted in 9,240 individuals of European ancestry from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and the GWAS for PT was conducted in 2,583 participants from the Genetic Study of Three Population Microisolates in South Tyrol (MICROS) and the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936. Replication was assessed in 1,041 to 3,467 individuals. For aPTT, previously reported associations with KNG1, HRG, F11, F12, and ABO were confirmed. A second independent association in ABO was identified and replicated (rs8176704, p = 4.26 × 10(-24)). Pooling the ARIC and replication data yielded two additional loci in F5 (rs6028, p = 3.22 × 10(-9)) and AGBL1 (rs2469184, p = 3.61 × 10(-8)). For PT, significant associations were identified and confirmed in F7 (rs561241, p = 3.71 × 10(-56)) and PROCR/EDEM2 (rs2295888, p = 5.25 × 10(-13)). Assessment of existing gene expression and coronary artery disease (CAD) databases identified associations of five of the GWAS loci with altered gene expression and two with CAD. In summary, eight genetic loci that account for ∼29% of the variance in aPTT and two loci that account for ∼14% of the variance in PT were detected and supported by functional data.	 9414276 21829388 15869579 16114812 15921688 16634742 17284699 17393014 17327234 17384015 17597995 17550581 17701901 17723119 17924335 18053258 18328308 18349091 18462017 19715440 19696402 19583818 20231535 20303064 20502693 20598278 20616382 20539911 20923989 20833654 10747348 10938027 11057869 11038326 11734674 14629454 14656739 2646917 8034238 7805216 9111133 18249579 18797129 18784653 18680534 18940858 19273244 19278955 21058334 20802025 21378990 21270443 21637794 21602305 15748207
22719876	Genetic polymorphisms of the human PNPLA3 gene are strongly associated with severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Japanese.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a broad range of liver pathologies from simple steatosis to cirrhosis and fibrosis, in which a subtype accompanying hepatocyte degeneration and fibrosis is classified as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH accounts for approximately 10-30% of NAFLD and causes a higher frequency of liver-related death, and its progression of NASH has been considered to be complex involving multiple genetic factors interacting with the environment and lifestyle.	 21737970 21623852 10348825 11315092 7382552 8335202 9516397 10484010 15297300 16401483 16862161 17701901 18843018 18820647 18688846 19738004 20034933 20335584 20858492 21199527 21423719 21320639 21381068 21505073 21700865 21176169

22726844	A common variant in SLC8A1 is associated with the duration of the electrocardiographic QT interval.	Prolongation of the electrocardiographic QT interval, a measure of cardiac repolarization, predisposes one to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Since NOS1AP, a regulator of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, was discovered in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as a novel target that modulates cardiac repolarization, several loci have been linked to the QT interval in studies (QTGEN and QTSCD) of European descendents. However, there has been no GWAS of the QT interval in Asian populations. We conducted a GWAS with regard to the QT interval in Korea Association Resource (KARE [n = 6,805]) cohorts. Replication studies in independent populations of Korean (n = 4,686) and Japanese (n = 2,687) groups validated the association between a SNP, rs13017846, which maps to near SLC8A1 (sodium/calcium exchanger 1 precursor, overall p = 8.0 × 10(-14)), and the QT interval. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs13017846 varies widely between ethnicities-0.053 in Europeans (HapMap CEU [Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe from the Centre d'Étude du Polymorphisme Humain collection] samples) versus 0.080 in Africans (HapMap YRI [Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria] samples)-whereas a MAF of 0.500 has been reported in Asians (HapMap HCB [Han Chinese in Beijing, China] and JPT [Japanese in Tokyo, Japan] samples). This might explain why this locus has not been identified in Europeans in previous studies.	 16993419 12436197 17786212 1519533 19243007 11239413 1914093 15851319 15078854 16648850 8239250 16267090 19305409 10967099 18031506 11083730 19396169 20642543 19305408
22745674	Genome-wide association study in a Lebanese cohort confirms PHACTR1 as a major determinant of coronary artery stenosis.	The manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD) follows a well-choreographed series of events that includes damage of arterial endothelial cells and deposition of lipids in the sub-endothelial layers. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of multiple populations with distinctive genetic and lifestyle backgrounds are a crucial step in understanding global CAD pathophysiology. In this study, we report a GWAS on the genetic basis of arterial stenosis as measured by cardiac catheterization in a Lebanese population. The locus of the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1) showed association with coronary stenosis in a discovery experiment with genome wide data in 1,949 individuals (rs9349379, OR = 1.37, p = 1.57×10(-5)). The association was replicated in an additional 2,547 individuals (OR = 1.31, p = 8.85×10(-6)), leading to genome-wide significant association in a combined analysis (OR = 1.34, p = 8.02×10(-10)). Results from this GWAS support a central role of PHACTR1 in CAD susceptibility irrespective of lifestyle and ethnic divergences. This association provides a plausible component for understanding molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of stenosis in cardiac vessels and a potential drug target against CAD.	 15983262 15640973 16087188 16330695 15985286 16862161 17211010 16839566 17478681 17466957 17634449 18193043 18288184 18974171 19198609 20691447 20935630 20962429 20660145 21142536 21226609 21378988 21378990 22216278 11855950 12763760 15364185 3940442 8127331 9040041 9231280 16175706
22737229	Genome-wide association study confirming association of HLA-DP with protection against chronic hepatitis B and viral clearance in Japanese and Korean.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to serious liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, about 85-90% of infected individuals become inactive carriers with sustained biochemical remission and very low risk of LC or HCC. To identify host genetic factors contributing to HBV clearance, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and replication analysis using samples from HBV carriers and spontaneously HBV-resolved Japanese and Korean individuals. Association analysis in the Japanese and Korean data identified the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes with P(meta) = 1.89×10⁻¹² for rs3077 and P(meta) = 9.69×10⁻¹⁰ for rs9277542. We also found that the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes were significantly associated with protective effects against chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japanese, Korean and other Asian populations, including Chinese and Thai individuals (P(meta) = 4.40×10⁻¹⁹ for rs3077 and P(meta) = 1.28×10⁻¹⁵ for rs9277542). These results suggest that the associations between the HLA-DP locus and the protective effects against persistent HBV infection and with clearance of HBV were replicated widely in East Asian populations; however, there are no reports of GWAS in Caucasian or African populations. Based on the GWAS in this study, there were no significant SNPs associated with HCC development. To clarify the pathogenesis of CHB and the mechanisms of HBV clearance, further studies are necessary, including functional analyses of the HLA-DP molecule.	 18695938 20068345 21402545 21750111 12124470 7898524 22105689 21423260 17359929 22253840 19349983 21274863 21904616 17393513 21408128 18814241 1285514 541683 18803882 1534885 21070536 15915462
23505185	A variant in the LRRFIP1 gene is associated with adiposity and inflammation.	Inflammation is an important factor linking abdominal obesity with insulin resistance and related cardiometabolic risk. A genome-wide association study of adiposity-related traits performed in the Quebec Family Study (QFS) revealed that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the LRRFIP1 gene (rs11680012) was associated with abdominal adiposity (P = 4.6 × 10(-6)).	
22744181	Bivariate genome-wide association study suggests that the DARC gene influences lean body mass and age at menarche.	Lean body mass (LBM) and age at menarche (AAM) are two important complex traits for human health. The aim of this study was to identify pleiotropic genes for both traits using a powerful bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS). Two studies, a discovery study and a replication study, were performed. In the discovery study, 909622 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 801 unrelated female Han Chinese subjects using the Affymetrix human genome-wide SNP array 6.0 platform. Then, a bivariate GWAS was performed to identify the SNPs that may be important for LBM and AAM. In the replication study, significant findings from the discovery study were validated in 1692 unrelated Caucasian female subjects. One SNP rs3027009 that was bivariately associated with left arm lean mass and AAM in the discovery samples (P=7.26×10(-6)) and in the replication samples (P=0.005) was identified. The SNP is located at the upstream of DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) gene, suggesting that DARC may play an important role in regulating the metabolisms of both LBM and AAM.

22699663	Genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.	Pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases, including chronic periodontitis. To date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study among 1,020 white participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. We examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) colonization. Genotyping was performed on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform. Imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on HapMap II-CEU, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold of p < 5 × 10(-8)). We detected no genome-wide significant signals. However, 13 loci, including KCNK1, FBXO38, UHRF2, IL33, RUNX2, TRPS1, CAMTA1, and VAMP3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 × 10(-6)) of association. All associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for Aa, had the same effect direction in a second sample of 123 African-American participants. None of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. Investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.	 20514045 20860759 22271008 10914791 11073323 11701471 11593451 12013340 2646917 1313107 7833043 9495612 15642056 15297300 15699278 15716906 16930307 17452560 17943116 18062113 18256235 18946007 19485767 20233392 20634204 20681812 21565393
22751097	Genome-wide association study in Han Chinese identifies four new susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease.	We performed a meta-analysis of 2 genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease comprising 1,515 cases and 5,019 controls followed by replication studies in 15,460 cases and 11,472 controls, all of Chinese Han ancestry. We identify four new loci for coronary artery disease that reached the threshold of genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). These loci mapped in or near TTC32-WDR35, GUCY1A3, C6orf10-BTNL2 and ATP2B1. We also replicated four loci previously identified in European populations (in or near PHACTR1, TCF21, CDKN2A-CDKN2B and C12orf51). These findings provide new insights into pathways contributing to the susceptibility for coronary artery disease in the Chinese Han population.	 10987628 17554300 17478681 17634449 17194218 17701901 18193644 19034521 19198609 19198610 19715440 19820697 19882345 20686565 20616382 19430479 19430483 20662065 21058334 21160056 21378986 21378990 21326295 21606405 21572416 21875899 21909109 21909115 21971053 11315092 12168954 14685227 15497498 8822996 13974778 15735647 15836888 16162883 16862161 17478679

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis worldwide and is a major cause of pain and disability in elderly people. The health economic burden of osteoarthritis is increasing commensurate with obesity prevalence and longevity. Osteoarthritis has a strong genetic component but the success of previous genetic studies has been restricted due to insufficient sample sizes and phenotype heterogeneity.	 11073507 11697796 21907813 12898521 15156188 15308512 8662561 9182762 9250761 10227293 10227294 15766999 15910695 16012751 16079159 17000755 17384641 17434869 17554300 18299287 18951797 19153142 19479880 19958398 20008919 20112360 20060954 20170770 20573900 20807643 20499385 21079645 21068099 20870806 21177295 17966093 21871595

22760553	Genome-wide pharmacogenomic study of citalopram-induced side effects in STAR*D.	Affecting about 1 in 12 Americans annually, depression is a leading cause of the global disease burden. While a range of effective antidepressants are now available, failure and relapse rates remain substantial, with intolerable side effect burden the most commonly cited reason for discontinuation. Thus, understanding individual differences in susceptibility to antidepressant therapy side effects will be essential to optimize depression treatment. Here we perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic variation influencing susceptibility to citalopram-induced side effects. The analysis sample consisted of 1762 depression patients, successfully genotyped for 421K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR(*)D) study. Outcomes included five indicators of citalopram side effects: general side effect burden, overall tolerability, sexual side effects, dizziness and vision/hearing side effects. Two SNPs met our genome-wide significance criterion (q<0.1), ensuring that, on average, only 10% of significant findings are false discoveries. In total, 12 additional SNPs demonstrated suggestive associations (q<0.5). The top finding was rs17135437, an intronic SNP within EMID2, mediating the effects of citalopram on vision/hearing side effects (P=3.27 × 10(-8), q=0.026). The second genome-wide significant finding, representing a haplotype spanning ∼30 kb and eight genotyped SNPs in a gene desert on chromosome 13, was associated with general side effect burden (P=3.22 × 10(-7), q=0.096). Suggestive findings were also found for SNPs at LAMA1, AOX2P, EGFLAM, FHIT and RTP2. Although our findings require replication and functional validation, this study demonstrates the potential of GWAS to discover genes and pathways that potentially mediate adverse effects of antidepressant medications.	 16390886 15789306 19212876 20800603 16862161 12551730 16713569 21351276 17463249 18199864 19355968 15834813 15939839 7682012 15061154 20921969 7168798 1363418 16429123 16344560 18982004 19282985 19727342 18988837 12883005 19118814 9635230 18404147 19030899 19846067 9789202 18641643 20021359 21172166 19672032 12721631 9829013 20628086 16633137 16728903 8595806 12221002 20195266 19875103 18519826 21107309 7811843 20876614 9403953 16013901 20634204 9622046 17701901 17470669 21307941 22298480 5097136 2645849 20619826 19721433 12234237 11918502 21086123 10549684 15121641 18930379 20047055
22792071	WNT16 influences bone mineral density, cortical bone thickness, bone strength, and osteoporotic fracture risk.	We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with cortical bone thickness (CBT) and bone mineral density (BMD) by performing two separate genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses for CBT in 3 cohorts comprising 5,878 European subjects and for BMD in 5 cohorts comprising 5,672 individuals. We then assessed selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for osteoporotic fracture in 2,023 cases and 3,740 controls. Association with CBT and forearm BMD was tested for ∼2.5 million SNPs in each cohort separately, and results were meta-analyzed using fixed effect meta-analysis. We identified a missense SNP (Thr>Ile; rs2707466) located in the WNT16 gene (7q31), associated with CBT (effect size of -0.11 standard deviations [SD] per C allele, P = 6.2 × 10(-9)). This SNP, as well as another nonsynonymous SNP rs2908004 (Gly>Arg), also had genome-wide significant association with forearm BMD (-0.14 SD per C allele, P = 2.3 × 10(-12), and -0.16 SD per G allele, P = 1.2 × 10(-15), respectively). Four genome-wide significant SNPs arising from BMD meta-analysis were tested for association with forearm fracture. SNP rs7776725 in FAM3C, a gene adjacent to WNT16, was associated with a genome-wide significant increased risk of forearm fracture (OR = 1.33, P = 7.3 × 10(-9)), with genome-wide suggestive signals from the two missense variants in WNT16 (rs2908004: OR = 1.22, P = 4.9 × 10(-6) and rs2707466: OR = 1.22, P = 7.2 × 10(-6)). We next generated a homozygous mouse with targeted disruption of Wnt16. Female Wnt16(-/-) mice had 27% (P<0.001) thinner cortical bones at the femur midshaft, and bone strength measures were reduced between 43%-61% (6.5 × 10(-13)<P<5.9 × 10(-4)) at both femur and tibia, compared with their wild-type littermates. Natural variation in humans and targeted disruption in mice demonstrate that WNT16 is an important determinant of CBT, BMD, bone strength, and risk of fracture.	 14660243 14969401 14740151 15371327 4795916 17242321 16939402 17444815 17539738 17903296 18349094 18455228 18445777 18263651 19079262 19016592 19396169 19543373 19700477 19841454 19801982 19808636 20031566 20072603 8506892 8619384 15523071 15619671 15365697 15940376 16007330 16157825 16598372 16475872 17144789 20059962 20233392 20472174 20375209 20509871 21124946 21124974 20464545 21533022 21473947 21654806 21565789 21867596 22159821 18021006 10980570 11095169 11237119 11719191 11780939 11855950 12015390
22763476	Genome-wide linkage and association scans for pulse pressure in Chinese twins.	Elevated pulse pressure (PP) is associated with cardiovascular disorders and mortality in various populations. The genetic influence on PP has been confirmed by heritability estimates using related individuals. Recently, efforts have been made by mapping genes that are linked to the phenotype. We report the results of our gene mapping studies conducted in the Chinese population in mainland China. The genome-wide linkage and association scans were carried out on 63 middle-aged dizygotic twin pairs using high-density markers. The linkage analysis identified three significant linkage peaks (all with a single point P<1e(-05)) on chromosome 11 (LOD core 4.06 at 30.5 cM), chromosome 12 (LOD score 3.97 at 100.7 cM) and chromosome 18 (LOD score 4.01 at 70.7 cM), with the last two peaks closely overlapping with linkage peaks reported by two American studies. Multiple regions with suggestive linkages were identified, with many of the peaks overlapping with published linkage regions. The genome-wide association analysis detected a suggestive association on chromosome 4 (rs17031508, P<8.34e(-08)) located within a wide region of suggestive linkage. Our results provide some evidence for genetic linkages and associations with PP in the Chinese population. Further investigation is warranted to replicate the findings and to explore the susceptibility loci or genes for PP.	
22792070	Meta-analysis of genome-wide scans for total body BMD in children and adults reveals allelic heterogeneity and age-specific effects at the WNT16 locus.	To identify genetic loci influencing bone accrual, we performed a genome-wide association scan for total-body bone mineral density (TB-BMD) variation in 2,660 children of different ethnicities. We discovered variants in 7q31.31 associated with BMD measurements, with the lowest P = 4.1 × 10(-11) observed for rs917727 with minor allele frequency of 0.37. We sought replication for all SNPs located ± 500 kb from rs917727 in 11,052 additional individuals from five independent studies including children and adults, together with de novo genotyping of rs3801387 (in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs917727) in 1,014 mothers of children from the discovery cohort. The top signal mapping in the surroundings of WNT16 was replicated across studies with a meta-analysis P = 2.6 × 10(-31) and an effect size explaining between 0.6%-1.8% of TB-BMD variance. Conditional analyses on this signal revealed a secondary signal for total body BMD (P = 1.42 × 10(-10)) for rs4609139 and mapping to C7orf58. We also examined the genomic region for association with skull BMD to test if the associations were independent of skeletal loading. We identified two signals influencing skull BMD variation, including rs917727 (P = 1.9 × 10(-16)) and rs7801723 (P = 8.9 × 10(-28)), also mapping to C7orf58 (r(2) = 0.50 with rs4609139). Wnt16 knockout (KO) mice with reduced total body BMD and gene expression profiles in human bone biopsies support a role of C7orf58 and WNT16 on the BMD phenotypes observed at the human population level. In summary, we detected two independent signals influencing total body and skull BMD variation in children and adults, thus demonstrating the presence of allelic heterogeneity at the WNT16 locus. One of the skull BMD signals mapping to C7orf58 is mostly driven by children, suggesting temporal determination on peak bone mass acquisition. Our life-course approach postulates that these genetic effects influencing peak bone mass accrual may impact the risk of osteoporosis later in life.	 21798870 21757498 11735756 12160727 21656266 22159821 11061556 11095990 11237119 12929944 15940376 16007330 16670761 18438861 18445777 18633664 18988698 19181680 19396169 19715440 19524639 19753111 19700477 19801982 19453261 20027296 19922823 20562875 20967563 21654806 21877163 11241160
22792221	Common variants on chromosome 9p21 are associated with normal tension glaucoma.	Although intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most definitive cause of glaucoma, a subtype of open angle glaucoma (OAG) termed normal tension glaucoma (NTG), which occurs in spite of normal IOP, accounts for a large part of glaucoma cases, especially in Japan. To find common genetic variants contributing to NTG in Japanese patients, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We performed the first screening for 531,009 autosomal SNPs with a discovery cohort of 286 cases and 557 controls, and then a second screening for the top 30 suggestive loci in an independent cohort of 183 cases and 514 controls. Our findings identified a significantly associated SNP; rs523096 [combined p-value = 7.40× 10(-8), odds ratio (OR)= 2.00 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.55-2.58] located 10 kbp upstream of CDKN2B on chromosome 9p21. Moreover, analysis of another independent case-control set successfully replicated the results of the screening studies (combined values of all 3 stages p = 4.96 × 10(-11), OR= 2.13 with 95% CI 1.69-2.68). The SNPs near rs523096 were recently reported to be associated with OAG associated with elevated IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the predominant subtype of glaucoma in Caucasian populations. Our results revealed that the 9p21 locus is also associated with NTG in Japanese. In addition, we identified SNPs more strongly associated with NTG.	 9003345 9258226 9267600 9402827 9497264 9780094 9804136 9869795 10396201 15557444 15297300 15789306 16125544 15834611 16148883 16462187 16488940 16723461 16778644 16885925 16921403 17055429 17188046 17359929 19625618 20173736 20386740 18586872 18803882 19233171 19578366 19578367 12049574 12073024 12029063 12185121 12379839 12523884 12578784 11133713 12671471 12770963 14551537 14597044 20548946 20363506 20601957 20835238 20862607 21151960 20956613 21398277 21427129 21532571 21269703 21508110 20708611 21034224 22011818 22428042 10653426 10734239 10853929 11024415 11094181 11283614 11529911 11834836 17654117 17701901 18176561 15350316 15377555 7458737 7260018 7295129 4019101 3737131 2056646 1765290 1521811 1427132 1454314 8435391 8435394 8299973 8078588 7977577 7657539 8764798 8976695
22792082	Genome-wide association analysis in asthma subjects identifies SPATS2L as a novel bronchodilator response gene.	Bronchodilator response (BDR) is an important asthma phenotype that measures reversibility of airway obstruction by comparing lung function (i.e. FEV(1)) before and after the administration of a short-acting β(2)-agonist, the most common rescue medications used for the treatment of asthma. BDR also serves as a test of β(2)-agonist efficacy. BDR is a complex trait that is partly under genetic control. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BDR, quantified as percent change in baseline FEV(1) after administration of a β(2)-agonist, was performed with 1,644 non-Hispanic white asthmatic subjects from six drug clinical trials: CAMP, LOCCS, LODO, a medication trial conducted by Sepracor, CARE, and ACRN. Data for 469,884 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to measure the association of SNPs with BDR using a linear regression model, while adjusting for age, sex, and height. Replication of primary P-values was attempted in 501 white subjects from SARP and 550 white subjects from DAG. Experimental evidence supporting the top gene was obtained via siRNA knockdown and Western blotting analyses. The lowest overall combined P-value was 9.7E-07 for SNP rs295137, near the SPATS2L gene. Among subjects in the primary analysis, those with rs295137 TT genotype had a median BDR of 16.0 (IQR = [6.2, 32.4]), while those with CC or TC genotypes had a median BDR of 10.9 (IQR = [5.0, 22.2]). SPATS2L mRNA knockdown resulted in increased β(2)-adrenergic receptor levels. Our results suggest that SPATS2L may be an important regulator of β(2)-adrenergic receptor down-regulation and that there is promise in gaining a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of differential response to β(2)-agonists through GWAS.	 12444029 10984540 14516725 14610472 14597484 14960456 15157730 15500895 2645779 1952453 8519373 7623883 10027502 15879435 16862161 16925834 17001289 17141853 16998094 17291857 17507702 17701901 18193043 18303970 18408560 18617639 18848350 19005571 19300499 19059887 19729670 20124949 20300088 20339536 20422032 20515836 20410506 20647212 11069822 11318835 20634204 20860503 21804549 21991891 11359637 10903223 10950895 12464936
22673310	Genome-wide association study identifies common variants at TNFRSF13B associated with IgG level in a healthy Chinese male population.	IgG has a crucial role in humoral immune response. Serum IgG level is mainly determined under genetic control. To explore the genetic influence on serum IgG levels, a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in a healthy Chinese population of 3495 men, including 1999 unrelated subjects in the first stage and 1496 independent individuals in the second stage. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in TNFRSF13B on 17p11.2 or nearby were significantly associated with IgG level: rs4792800 in the intron (combined P-value=1.45 × 10(-12)), rs12603708 in the intron (combined P-value=1.82 × 10(-8)) and rs3751987 at ~65 kb downstream of the 5'-UTR region of TNFRSF13B (combined P-value=3.67 × 10(-9)). Additionally, smoking was identified to be associated with IgG level in both stages (P<0.001), but there was no significant interaction between smoking and the identified SNPs (P>0.05). The strong association between variants at TNFRSF13B and IgG level may be helpful to further explore the biological mechanism by which the serum IgG is affected by transmembrane activator, calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor encoded by TNFRSF13B.	
22773346	Linkage and association of successful aging to the 6q25 region in large Amish kindreds.	Successful aging (SA) is a multidimensional phenotype involving living to older age with high physical function, preserved cognition, and continued social engagement. Several domains underlying SA are heritable, and identifying health-promoting polymorphisms and their interactions with the environment could provide important information regarding the health of older adults. In the present study, we examined 263 cognitively intact Amish individuals age 80 and older (74 SA and 189 "normally aged") all of whom are part of a single 13-generation pedigree. A genome-wide association study of 630,309 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed and analyzed for linkage using multipoint analyses and for association using the modified quasi-likelihood score test. There was evidence for linkage on 6q25-27 near the fragile site FRA6E region with a dominant model maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD score = 3.2. The 1-LOD-down support interval for this linkage contained one SNP for which there was regionally significant evidence of association (rs205990, p = 2.36 × 10(-5)). This marker survived interval-wide Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and was located between the genes QKI and PDE10A. Other areas of chromosome 6q25-q27 (including the FRA6E region) contained several SNPs associated with SA (minimum p = 2.89 × 10(-6)). These findings suggest potentially novel genes in the 6q25-q27 region linked and associated with SA in the Amish; however, these findings should be verified in an independent replication cohort.	 21418511 15236771 22101883 10719763 10812327 11032786 11162685 5918309 5349366 137366 6601609 6418786 6234800 3611032 3249773 8169338 8651641 9279031 15677572 15888337 15985536 16078048 16407577 16389594 16478568 17668381 17210144 17701901 17903295 17989245 18514160 18301450 18776909 19158193 19793722 19837933 19367585 20008481 20304771 20708717 20923867 20881262 21355834 21668908 21388494 11731797 12030885 12060785 12888984 15050300 21740922
22780124	Genome-wide association study of a quantitative disordered gambling trait.	Disordered gambling is a moderately heritable trait, but the underlying genetic basis is largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for disordered gambling using a quantitative factor score in 1312 twins from 894 Australian families. Association was conducted for 2 381 914 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the family-based association test in Merlin followed by gene and pathway enrichment analyses. Although no SNP reached genome-wide significance, six achieved P-values < 1 × 10(-5) with variants in three genes (MT1X, ATXN1 and VLDLR) implicated in disordered gambling. Secondary case-control analyses found two SNPs on chromosome 9 (rs1106076 and rs12305135 near VLDLR) and rs10812227 near FZD10 on chromosome 12 to be significantly associated with lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition pathological gambling and South Oaks Gambling Screen classified probable pathological gambling status. Furthermore, several addiction-related pathways were enriched for SNPs associated with disordered gambling. Finally, gene-based analysis of 24 candidate genes for dopamine agonist-induced gambling in individuals with Parkinson's disease suggested an enrichment of SNPs associated with disordered gambling. We report the first GWAS of disordered gambling. While further replication is required, the identification of susceptibility loci and biological pathways will be important in characterizing the biological mechanisms that underpin disordered gambling.	 21477226 21253885 21529783 21897848 10801388 17053810 17158188 17261317 17357068 17701901 17445781 17924335 17948030 17936586 18179280 18300295 19210181 19249271 19268276 18957430 19265028 19188921 19686516 19442458 11553044 12065639 15217328 15306638 3631315 7868187 7792345 9926543 16278489 16595738 19803770 19896111 20083479 20167757 19914604 20491072 20530012 20201926 20598278 20477910 20811658 20721537 20814781 21443290
22791750	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci association with fasting insulin and insulin resistance in African Americans.	Insulin resistance (IR) is a key determinant of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other metabolic disorders. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) was designed to shed light on the genetic basis of fasting insulin (FI) and IR in 927 non-diabetic African Americans. 5 396 838 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for associations with FI or IR with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension status and first two principal components. Genotyped SNPs (n = 12) with P < 5 × 10(-6) in African Americans were carried forward for de novo genotyping in 570 non-diabetic West Africans. We replicated SNPs in or near SC4MOL and TCERG1L in West Africans. The meta-analysis of 1497 African Americans and West Africans yielded genome-wide significant associations for SNPs in the SC4MOL gene: rs17046216 (P = 1.7 × 10(-8) and 2.9 × 10(-8) for FI and IR, respectively); and near the TCERG1L gene with rs7077836 as the top scoring (P = 7.5 × 10(-9) and 4.9 × 10(-10) for FI and IR, respectively). In silico replication in the MAGIC study (n = 37 037) showed weak but significant association (adjusted P-value of 0.0097) for rs34602777 in the MYO5A gene. In addition, we replicated previous GWAS findings for IR and FI in Europeans for GCKR, and for variants in four T2D loci (FTO, IRS1, KLF14 and PPARG) which exert their action via IR. In summary, variants in/near SC4MOL, and TCERG1L were associated with FI and IR in this cohort of African Americans and were replicated in West Africans. SC4MOL is under-expressed in an animal model of T2D and plays a key role in lipid biosynthesis, with implications for the regulation of energy metabolism, obesity and dyslipidemia. TCERG1L is associated with plasma adiponectin, a key modulator of obesity, inflammation, IR and diabetes.	 1881419 16862161 20018283 18660489 19609347 12196442 18194136 11164120 20581827 18776908 12864871 15494731 17394647 21047519 12667960 9545414 8079995 21058334 17515613 17701901 18348202 10702157 21188353 15788565 21490949 16731824 19918757 8370335 12037405 12933562 20081858 3899825
22807686	GWAS identifies novel susceptibility loci on 6p21.32 and 21q21.3 for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified KIF1B as susceptibility locus for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To further identify novel susceptibility loci associated with HBV-related HCC and replicate the previously reported association, we performed a large three-stage GWAS in the Han Chinese population. 523,663 autosomal SNPs in 1,538 HBV-positive HCC patients and 1,465 chronic HBV carriers were genotyped for the discovery stage. Top candidate SNPs were genotyped in the initial validation samples of 2,112 HBV-positive HCC cases and 2,208 HBV carriers and then in the second validation samples of 1,021 cases and 1,491 HBV carriers. We discovered two novel associations at rs9272105 (HLA-DQA1/DRB1) on 6p21.32 (OR = 1.30, P = 1.13×10⁻¹⁹) and rs455804 (GRIK1) on 21q21.3 (OR = 0.84, P = 1.86×10⁻⁸), which were further replicated in the fourth independent sample of 1,298 cases and 1,026 controls (rs9272105: OR = 1.25, P = 1.71×10⁻⁴; rs455804: OR = 0.84, P = 6.92×10⁻³). We also revealed the associations of HLA-DRB1*0405 and 0901*0602, which could partially account for the association at rs9272105. The association at rs455804 implicates GRIK1 as a novel susceptibility gene for HBV-related HCC, suggesting the involvement of glutamate signaling in the development of HBV-related HCC.	 16862161 21750111 21725309 21681448 17257320 21314952 19824040 21192095 18821214 10904089 21480342 19349983 21378340 17186951 15297300 15661683 16998491 21656577 18761557 20676096 17701901 21296855 21172035 21167853 9169913 21207374 21633537 19543373 20521253 21034965 21499248 15915462
22788528	Genetic associations with C-reactive protein level and white blood cell count in the KARE study.	C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) have been utilized as critical markers contributing to acute and chronic inflammation. Genome-wide associations were examined to identify nucleotide sequence variants associated with the two markers using 8842 individuals in the Korean Association REsource (KARE) study. A total of six and three nucleotide variants turned out to be associated with CRP and WBC (P < 1.42 × 10(-7) ), and they were mutually exclusive. The only common variant associated with CRP was rs2393791 within hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) gene [minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.478]. The only common variant associated with WBC [MAF = 0.468] was rs8078723, an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism located between proteasome 26S subunits non-ATPase 3 (PSMD3) and colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3) in chromosome 17. The 2 variants were also associated with other inflammation-related phenotypes (P < 0.05), and each phenotype was associated with the variant rs2393791 or with the variant rs8078723. We suggested that HNF1A gene was associated with CRP, and the region including PSMD3 and CSF3 genes was associated with WBC. The two inflammatory markers appeared to have distinct genetic components. Not only the functions of these two markers but also the functions of the corresponding genetic components might be largely complementary in determining inflammation process.	
22797724	A genome-wide association study identifies two new susceptibility loci for lung adenocarcinoma in the Japanese population.	Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of lung cancer, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. To identify genetic factors influencing risk of lung adenocarcinoma, we conducted a genome-wide association study and two validation studies in the Japanese population comprising a total of 6,029 individuals with lung adenocarcinoma (cases) and 13,535 controls. We confirmed two previously reported risk loci, 5p15.33 (rs2853677, P(combined) = 2.8 × 10(-40), odds ratio (OR) = 1.41) and 3q28 (rs10937405, P(combined) = 6.9 × 10(-17), OR = 1.25), and identified two new susceptibility loci, 17q24.3 (rs7216064, P(combined) = 7.4 × 10(-11), OR = 1.20) and 6p21.3 (rs3817963, P(combined) = 2.7 × 10(-10), OR = 1.18). These data provide further evidence supporting a role for genetic susceptibility in the development of lung adenocarcinoma.	 20871597 21654818 21297633 16862161 21596426 17982410 18385676 18978787 20061363 17572673 3329634 18978790 17882278 18385738 18817904 19915573 21804548 18437052 15052270 20876614 20634204 17701901 21725308 21610222 17290066 19654303 19836008 20410501
22797727	Meta-analysis identifies multiple loci associated with kidney function-related traits in east Asian populations.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD), impairment of kidney function, is a serious public health problem, and the assessment of genetic factors influencing kidney function has substantial clinical relevance. Here, we report a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for kidney function-related traits, including 71,149 east Asian individuals from 18 studies in 11 population-, hospital- or family-based cohorts, conducted as part of the Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network (AGEN). Our meta-analysis identified 17 loci newly associated with kidney function-related traits, including the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, uric acid and serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine levels (eGFRcrea) (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)). We further examined these loci with in silico replication in individuals of European ancestry from the KidneyGen, CKDGen and GUGC consortia, including a combined total of ∼110,347 individuals. We identify pleiotropic associations among these loci with kidney function-related traits and risk of CKD. These findings provide new insights into the genetics of kidney function.	 20884846 18327256 21572416 21738478 21909109 21909115 22084405 22344219 22344221 22446963 10553908 11904577 11961011 15024629 15339995 3516645 21196492 20383146 20383145 20139978 19525927 19503597 19430482 20700443 20686651 9286595 16470690 16869982 16998491 17982410 20416999 18327257 18852200

22829776	A genome-wide association meta-analysis of circulating sex hormone-binding globulin reveals multiple Loci implicated in sex steroid hormone regulation.	Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a glycoprotein responsible for the transport and biologic availability of sex steroid hormones, primarily testosterone and estradiol. SHBG has been associated with chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and with hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast and prostate cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 21,791 individuals from 10 epidemiologic studies and validated these findings in 7,046 individuals in an additional six studies. We identified twelve genomic regions (SNPs) associated with circulating SHBG concentrations. Loci near the identified SNPs included SHBG (rs12150660, 17p13.1, p = 1.8 × 10(-106)), PRMT6 (rs17496332, 1p13.3, p = 1.4 × 10(-11)), GCKR (rs780093, 2p23.3, p = 2.2 × 10(-16)), ZBTB10 (rs440837, 8q21.13, p = 3.4 × 10(-09)), JMJD1C (rs7910927, 10q21.3, p = 6.1 × 10(-35)), SLCO1B1 (rs4149056, 12p12.1, p = 1.9 × 10(-08)), NR2F2 (rs8023580, 15q26.2, p = 8.3 × 10(-12)), ZNF652 (rs2411984, 17q21.32, p = 3.5 × 10(-14)), TDGF3 (rs1573036, Xq22.3, p = 4.1 × 10(-14)), LHCGR (rs10454142, 2p16.3, p = 1.3 × 10(-07)), BAIAP2L1 (rs3779195, 7q21.3, p = 2.7 × 10(-08)), and UGT2B15 (rs293428, 4q13.2, p = 5.5 × 10(-06)). These genes encompass multiple biologic pathways, including hepatic function, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and T2D, androgen and estrogen receptor function, epigenetic effects, and the biology of sex steroid hormone-responsive cancers including breast and prostate cancer. We found evidence of sex-differentiated genetic influences on SHBG. In a sex-specific GWAS, the loci 4q13.2-UGT2B15 was significant in men only (men p = 2.5 × 10(-08), women p = 0.66, heterogeneity p = 0.003). Additionally, three loci showed strong sex-differentiated effects: 17p13.1-SHBG and Xq22.3-TDGF3 were stronger in men, whereas 8q21.12-ZBTB10 was stronger in women. Conditional analyses identified additional signals at the SHBG gene that together almost double the proportion of variance explained at the locus. Using an independent study of 1,129 individuals, all SNPs identified in the overall or sex-differentiated or conditional analyses explained ~15.6% and ~8.4% of the genetic variation of SHBG concentrations in men and women, respectively. The evidence for sex-differentiated effects and allelic heterogeneity highlight the importance of considering these features when estimating complex trait variance.	 22001757 21643755 22197933 21630414 10946891 10973253 11159353 11159850 11279518 11476353 11473114 20668700 20574426 20837016 14671199 14764814 15475248 2824266 2544998 1846101 2002058 8372597 7523453 7776974 7651477 8798412 9285688 9295060 9388499 9852068 10358072 15666817 15788499 16143106 16966434 17430976 17568789 17848572 17698910 17992261 17989996 18464913 18650507 21114848 21151128 21071687 21071704 20625834 21156786 21391472 21236713 19937311 20081858 20116376 21569451 21674002 21613632 12884081 18678614 19064566 19073768 19241058 19179433 19336534 19533084 19572376 19657112 19936222 19933169 20204290 20047962 20219888 20382698 20352598 20375256 21752884 21678463 21998597
22814818	Population-based meta-analysis in Caucasians confirms association with COL5A1 and ZNF469 but not COL8A2 with central corneal thickness.	Central corneal thickness (CCT) has become an endophenotype of major interest for the genetically complex disorder glaucoma. CCT has a high heritability, and thin CCT is an independent risk factor for the diagnosis and progression of open-angle glaucoma. Genome-wide association studies thus provide genetic loci associated with CCT and potentially related to open-angle glaucoma. The distribution of CCT and prevalence of glaucoma in population-based studies have demonstrated ethnic differences suggesting ethnic-dependent variations in the genetic determinants of CCT. We conducted a genome-wide association study in Caucasians (n = 3,931) from the Gutenberg Health Study (Germany) followed by replication of 30 genome-wide significant SNPs or SNPs of interest (P < 10(-5)) in the Rotterdam Study (The Netherlands, n = 1,418). In a combined analysis, we confirmed quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 9q34 and 16q24 for association with CCT. On chromosome 16q24, the locus is located in an intergenic region near the ZNF469 gene (top SNP: rs9938149, P = 1.45 × 10(-12)). ZNF469 missense mutation is involved in a syndrome with very thin cornea (brittle cornea syndrome). The second locus on chromosome 9q34 represents the intergenic region between the RXRA and COL5A1 gene (top SNP: rs3132306, P = 2.71 × 10(-10)). Collagen type 5 determines the diameter of the corneal collagen fibrils. In our Caucasian population-based GWA study, we reinforce the involvement of collagen-related genes influencing CCT in Caucasians. We could not confirm the collagen type 8 locus on chromosome 1 as reported in Asian studies.	 14597030 20237253 20719862 19661234 16751036 9535620 8535602 21139683 21984434 16488940 19714363 19556215 20847697 17070596 17572673 12049575 19184301 16492673 15640920 21602731 21877163 20502693 19700477 20485516 21098505 22144904 18452888 16431952 3346334 11006506 16422223 20634204 17701901 21730848 20851442 21282999 11006503 17628686 22159420

Approximately 60%-80% of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have concurrent ulcerative colitis (UC). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in PSC have detected a number of susceptibility loci that also show associations in UC and other immune-mediated diseases. We aimed to systematically compare genetic associations in PSC with genotype data in UC patients with the aim of detecting new susceptibility loci for PSC. We performed combined analyses of GWAS for PSC and UC comprising 392 PSC cases, 987 UC cases, and 2,977 controls and followed up top association signals in an additional 1,012 PSC cases, 4,444 UC cases, and 11,659 controls. We discovered novel genome-wide significant associations with PSC at 2q37 [rs3749171 at G-protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35); P = 3.0 × 10(-9) in the overall study population, combined odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.39 (1.24-1.55)] and at 18q21 [rs1452787 at transcription factor 4 (TCF4); P = 2.61 × 10(-8) , OR (95% CI) = 0.75 (0.68-0.83)]. In addition, several suggestive PSC associations were detected. The GPR35 rs3749171 is a missense single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a shift from threonine to methionine. Structural modeling showed that rs3749171 is located in the third transmembrane helix of GPR35 and could possibly alter efficiency of signaling through the GPR35 receptor.	
22823124	The genetic aetiology of cannabis use initiation: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and a SNP-based heritability estimation.	While initiation of cannabis use is around 40% heritable, not much is known about the underlying genetic aetiology. Here, we meta-analysed two genome-wide association studies of initiation of cannabis use with > 10 000 individuals. None of the genetic variants reached genome-wide significance. We also performed a gene-based association test, which also revealed no significant effects of individual genes. Finally, we estimated that only approximately 6% of the variation in cannabis initiation is due to common genetic variants. Future genetic studies using larger sample sizes and different methodologies (including sequencing) might provide more insight in the complex genetic aetiology of cannabis use.	 12499305 23025612 17924335 19335651 19732865 19896111 20402985 20562875 20598278 21058334 21167468 21668797 21826061 21507154 22832902 17254428
22843503	Genome-wide association analysis identifies TYW3/CRYZ and NDST4 loci associated with circulating resistin levels.	Resistin is a polypeptide hormone that was reported to be associated with insulin resistance, inflammation and risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study on circulating resistin levels in individuals of European ancestry drawn from the two independent studies: the Nurses' Health Study (n = 1590) and the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (n = 1658). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the GWA analysis were replicated in an independent cohort of Europeans: the Gargano Family Study (n = 659). We confirmed the association with a previously known locus, the RETN gene (19p13.2), and identified two novel loci near the TYW3/CRYZ gene (1p31) and the NDST4 gene (4q25), associated with resistin levels at a genome-wide significant level, best represented by SNP rs3931020 (P = 6.37 × 10(-12)) and SNP rs13144478 (P = 6.19 × 10(-18)), respectively. Gene expression quantitative trait loci analyses showed a significant cis association between the SNP rs3931020 and CRYZ gene expression levels (P = 3.68 × 10(-7)). We also found that both of these two SNPs were significantly associated with resistin gene (RETN) mRNA levels in white blood cells from 68 subjects with type 2 diabetes (both P = 0.02). In addition, the resistin-rising allele of the TYW3/CRYZ SNP rs3931020, but not the NDST4 SNP rs13144478, showed a consistent association with increased coronary heart disease risk [odds ratio = 1.18 (95% CI, 1.03-1.34); P = 0.01]. Our results suggest that genetic variants in TYW3/CRYZ and NDST4 loci may be involved in the regulation of circulating resistin levels. More studies are needed to verify the associations of the SNP rs13144478 with NDST4 gene expression and resistin-related disease.	 19882136 19372460 19761474 20150558 20233392 20147318 20167575 20103721 20418489 20935630 21187261 21378990 21700879 21880673 11201732 11087757 11209052 12504108 14550293 14557464 14671216 14687894 14715842 14740159 15111497 8088825 9065374 15710760 16087164 16286524 16249281 16642040 16670163 16822679 17384338 17497241 17706624 17873877 18464913 18753313 19074981 19245965 20081858

22843504	Individual common variants exert weak effects on the risk for autism spectrum disorders.	While it is apparent that rare variation can play an important role in the genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the contribution of common variation to the risk of developing ASD is less clear. To produce a more comprehensive picture, we report Stage 2 of the Autism Genome Project genome-wide association study, adding 1301 ASD families and bringing the total to 2705 families analysed (Stages 1 and 2). In addition to evaluating the association of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we also sought evidence that common variants, en masse, might affect the risk. Despite genotyping over a million SNPs covering the genome, no single SNP shows significant association with ASD or selected phenotypes at a genome-wide level. The SNP that achieves the smallest P-value from secondary analyses is rs1718101. It falls in CNTNAP2, a gene previously implicated in susceptibility for ASD. This SNP also shows modest association with age of word/phrase acquisition in ASD subjects, of interest because features of language development are also associated with other variation in CNTNAP2. In contrast, allele scores derived from the transmission of common alleles to Stage 1 cases significantly predict case status in the independent Stage 2 sample. Despite being significant, the variance explained by these allele scores was small (Vm< 1%). Based on results from individual SNPs and their en masse effect on risk, as inferred from the allele score results, it is reasonable to conclude that common variants affect the risk for ASD but their individual effects are modest.	 21129364 19404257 21484201 21827697 22503632 17363630 19455578 20972252 18179893 15022205 21082657 20862653 19755429 17322880 21981781 19812673 21996756 21247446 19582487 18252227 17173049 19456320 2745388 21279722 22591576 22209245 19896112 11452361 20963441 18987363 20308993 17372818 7814313 20502679 22495306 21078308 22495311 22495309 12669065 20468056 19302947 19404256 18632090 22031302 22542183 21455290 20663923 17701901 11855955 18179894 21826059 18923514 20162629 21703496 21658581 11055368 18179895 18252225 21522181 19571811 18156158 21656903 18184952 16400609 20531469 22463983
22864923	Genome-wide association study identifies TNFSF13 as a susceptibility gene for IgA in a South Chinese population in smokers.	IgA is an important factor in our immune system. There are many diseases associated with it, such as IgA nephropathy, IgA deficiency, and so on. In order to describe the relationship between the genes and the IgA level, we performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA with 1,999 healthy Chinese men in the first stage and replicated on an independent Chinese sample with 1,496 subjects in the second stage. Association between each SNP with IgA was estimated by multivariate linear regression analysis conditioned on age and smoke. Haplotype analysis for the block around the top SNP was performed. In the first stage, one genomic locus was identified to be significantly associated with IgA. The loci is TNFSF13 (17p13.1; rs3803800; P = 6.26 × 10(-8)). In smoke-specific analysis, rs3803800 was approximately significantly associated with IgA levels in smokers (P = 3.96 × 10(-7)), while no association was observed in nonsmokers (P = 2.28 × 10(-1)). In addition, we performed the haplotype analysis on chromosome 17 with the SNPs around rs3803800. Although the total P value for the haplotype did not acquire significant difference, three haplotypes (TGAG, CACG, and CACA) reached significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, TNFSF13 could be a susceptible gene which was discovered having relationship with serum IgA level, and smoke might be a factor infecting the IgA level.	 16862161 16105688 15081523 7414242 18362943 17899538 17539718 22387304 4204534 22291608 15379977 19521068 4215824 19077279 20031604 18005364 19258388 21502573 12730512 21353261 20595679 21399633 12154359 18483500 17701901 14700539 17261616 15327382 11791212 22197929 14988498 8674189 7042142 18256354

We have conducted the first meta-analyses for nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) using data from the two largest genome-wide association studies published to date. We confirmed associations with all previously identified loci and identified six additional susceptibility regions (1p36, 2p21, 3p11.1, 8q21.3, 13q31.1 and 15q22). Analysis of phenotypic variability identified the first specific genetic risk factor for NSCLP (nonsyndromic cleft lip plus palate) (rs8001641; P(NSCLP) = 6.51 × 10(-11); homozygote relative risk = 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-3.16).	 8631261 21885341 17576140 17693063 17889454 17928214 18836445 19142206 19583827 20023658 19752161 20436469 20613842 21195053 16327884
22863731	Genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis at 17q24.3.	Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a potentially life-threatening complication of thyrotoxicosis. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a replication study with a total of 123 southern Chinese with TPP (cases) and 1,170 healthy controls and identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q24.3 near KCNJ2 (rs312691: odds ratio (OR) = 3.3; P(meta-analysis) = 1.8 × 10(-14)). All subjects with TPP also had Graves' disease, and subsequent TPP versus Graves' disease comparison confirmed that the association at 17q24.3 was specific to TPP. The area under the curve (AUC) of rs312691 genotype for risk prediction of TPP in subjects with Graves' disease was 0.73. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis identified SNPs in the region flanking rs312691 (±10 kb) that could potentially affect KCNJ2 expression (P = 0.0001). Our study has identified a susceptibility locus associated with TPP and provides insight into the causes of TPP.	 21209095 16608889 8080508 11060447 3287615 21304890 7063747 20086079 21047793 19944401 15297300 21058334 21281576 20634204 17701901 20074522 22399142 4106724 20702402 12148092

22890011	Genome-wide association study indicates variants associated with insulin signaling and inflammation mediate lipoprotein responses to fenofibrate.	A shift towards overall larger very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and smaller low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) diameters occurs in insulin resistance (IR), which reflects shifts in the distribution of the subfraction concentrations. Fenofibrate, indicated for hypertriglyceridemia, simultaneously reduces IR and shifts in lipoprotein diameter. Individual responses to fenofibrate vary, and we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic differences that could contribute to such differences.	 14568895 12540621 3120587 1556953 1326420 8647346 9409247 9555943 10383407 15543343 16759305 16896940 16978372 17110242 17407596 16765964 16911813 18042717 18242616 18776909 19103817 19023279 19502494 19715440 19936222 20461355 20686565 20634204 20729559 21058334 21854610 22156577 22547144 10634964 10802651 10837306 10978261 11053704 11289345 11342537 11722952 11874962 11893366 11996956 12215067 12515254 15380456
22886559	Genome-wide association study of glioma and meta-analysis.	Gliomas account for approximately 80 % of all primary malignant brain tumors and, despite improvements in clinical care over the last 20 years, remain among the most lethal tumors, underscoring the need for gaining new insights that could translate into clinical advances. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified seven new susceptibility regions. We conducted a new independent GWAS of glioma using 1,856 cases and 4,955 controls (from 14 cohort studies, 3 case-control studies, and 1 population-based case-only study) and found evidence of strong replication for three of the seven previously reported associations at 20q13.33 (RTEL), 5p15.33 (TERT), and 9p21.3 (CDKN2BAS), and consistent association signals for the remaining four at 7p11.2 (EGFR both loci), 8q24.21 (CCDC26) and 11q23.3 (PHLDB1). The direction and magnitude of the signal were consistent for samples from cohort and case-control studies, but the strength of the association was more pronounced for loci rs6010620 (20q,13.33; RTEL) and rs2736100 (5p15.33, TERT) in cohort studies despite the smaller number of cases in this group, likely due to relatively more higher grade tumors being captured in the cohort studies. We further examined the 85 most promising single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified in our study in three replication sets (5,015 cases and 11,601 controls), but no new markers reached genome-wide significance. Our findings suggest that larger studies focusing on novel approaches as well as specific tumor subtypes or subgroups will be required to identify additional common susceptibility loci for glioma risk.	 21531791 18798534 16862161 12800203 20847058 21742680 19356978 19578367 16530701 18596976 17964021 19578366 23095881 17529973 20399149 9098174 17401363 18784791 18772890 19228619 20462933 21946351 21356187 18006942 20562874 19836008 21454908 21203894
22885925	Genome-wide association study identifies eight new risk loci for polycystic ovary syndrome.	Following a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS 1) including 744 cases and 895 controls, we analyzed genome-wide association data from a new cohort of Han Chinese (GWAS 2) with 1,510 polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) cases and 2,016 controls. We followed up significantly associated signals identified in the combined results of GWAS 1 and 2 in a total of 8,226 cases and 7,578 controls. In addition to confirming the three loci we previously reported, we identify eight new PCOS association signals at P < 5 × 10(-8): 9q22.32, 11q22.1, 12q13.2, 12q14.3, 16q12.1, 19p13.3, 20q13.2 and a second independent signal at 2p16.3 (the FSHR gene). These PCOS association signals show evidence of enrichment for candidate genes related to insulin signaling, sexual hormone function and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Other candidate genes were related to calcium signaling and endocytosis. Our findings provide new insight and direction for discovering the biological mechanisms of PCOS.	 18981052 12356937 20668683 18198356 16630814 18603647 7606786 18978792 16862161 22499345 1968373 21829393 12520017 19557161 15498182 16772151 19715440 20596022 17572673 20581827 20932654 2168397 11844363 8528241 19466215 17554260 17767157 19430480 10333916 12477518 19956108 15740637 15608231 21058334 17554300 14711538 12697058 20015972 2460770 20634204 17701901 18372903 18158288 22037555 16203743 21151128 9466569 19543373 9847135 19811236

Here, we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TS in 1285 cases and 4964 ancestry-matched controls of European ancestry, including two European-derived population isolates, Ashkenazi Jews from North America and Israel and French Canadians from Quebec, Canada. In a primary meta-analysis of GWAS data from these European ancestry samples, no markers achieved a genome-wide threshold of significance (P<5 × 10(-8)); the top signal was found in rs7868992 on chromosome 9q32 within COL27A1 (P=1.85 × 10(-6)). A secondary analysis including an additional 211 cases and 285 controls from two closely related Latin American population isolates from the Central Valley of Costa Rica and Antioquia, Colombia also identified rs7868992 as the top signal (P=3.6 × 10(-7) for the combined sample of 1496 cases and 5249 controls following imputation with 1000 Genomes data). This study lays the groundwork for the eventual identification of common TS susceptibility variants in larger cohorts and helps to provide a more complete understanding of the full genetic architecture of this disorder.	 18573651 17304708 18413575 20351724 12601469 21484868 18668038 16862161 17977614 22344220 12809671 20445167 21520241 12714037 22036172 18300295 16582909 18940377 16536354 19913658 22169095 8215958 20616382 21304891 18698576 12875049 20485568 16224024 19571808 16536348 22083730 20595579 18369456 22036171 17701901 21826059 10972415 18348202 18243582 20215007 20427753 11024295 20981092 20955924 11202129 20020485 19543373 20154673 17158188
22889921	Genome-wide association study of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, debilitating neuropsychiatric illness with complex genetic etiology. The International OCD Foundation Genetics Collaborative (IOCDF-GC) is a multi-national collaboration established to discover the genetic variation predisposing to OCD. A set of individuals affected with DSM-IV OCD, a subset of their parents, and unselected controls, were genotyped with several different Illumina SNP microarrays. After extensive data cleaning, 1465 cases, 5557 ancestry-matched controls and 400 complete trios remained, with a common set of 469,410 autosomal and 9657 X-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Ancestry-stratified case-control association analyses were conducted for three genetically-defined subpopulations and combined in two meta-analyses, with and without the trio-based analysis. In the case-control analysis, the lowest two P-values were located within DLGAP1 (P=2.49 × 10(-6) and P=3.44 × 10(-6)), a member of the neuronal postsynaptic density complex. In the trio analysis, rs6131295, near BTBD3, exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold with a P-value=3.84 × 10(-8). However, when trios were meta-analyzed with the case-control samples, the P-value for this variant was 3.62 × 10(-5), losing genome-wide significance. Although no SNPs were identified to be associated with OCD at a genome-wide significant level in the combined trio-case-control sample, a significant enrichment of methylation QTLs (P<0.001) and frontal lobe expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (P=0.001) was observed within the top-ranked SNPs (P<0.01) from the trio-case-control analysis, suggesting these top signals may have a broad role in gene expression in the brain, and possibly in the etiology of OCD.	 17894418 19096451 20369019 15272418 22083728 20379614 3953865 19822783 13125550 16418238 19339359 18286588 19759535 16255080 19990606 15652477 19349310 19992565 19051237 12045153 20376697 7829526 18300295 16755275 6665096 21176025 18725912 21646580 20616382 12116192 21295225 19065146 20485568 19691954 22024159 16212834 17170002 17161383 19457049 17544380 16818867 17701901 3264144 17329475 22513993 20981092 14337420 20442332 21963369 18648523 17713528 20976279 12414123 21691774 16381938 19933162 8010383 19543373 17283288 20410850 6034395 18565990 17120193 16818866
22895189	Genome-wide association study indicates two novel resistance loci for severe malaria.	Malaria causes approximately one million fatalities per year, mostly among African children. Although highlighted by the strong protective effect of the sickle-cell trait, the full impact of human genetics on resistance to the disease remains largely unexplored. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are designed to unravel relevant genetic variants comprehensively; however, in malaria, as in other infectious diseases, these studies have been only partly successful. Here we identify two previously unknown loci associated with severe falciparum malaria in patients and controls from Ghana, West Africa. We applied the GWA approach to the diverse clinical syndromes of severe falciparum malaria, thereby targeting human genetic variants influencing any step in the complex pathogenesis of the disease. One of the loci was identified on chromosome 1q32 within the ATP2B4 gene, which encodes the main calcium pump of erythrocytes, the host cells of the pathogenic stage of malaria parasites. The second was indicated by an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 16q22.2, possibly linked to a neighbouring gene encoding the tight-junction protein MARVELD3. The protein is expressed on endothelial cells and might therefore have a role in microvascular damage caused by endothelial adherence of parasitized erythrocytes. We also confirmed previous reports on protective effects of the sickle-cell trait and blood group O. Our findings underline the potential of the GWA approach to provide candidates for the development of control measures against infectious diseases in humans.	 19465909 19474294 11103309 2690177 16104828 18003641 7538133 11832955 7723795 20802473 16001361 22305225 20606600 19422456 16259530 19197068 17609592 19789383 20797635 19897581 18063095 17701901 18348202 20028514 17367507 12682086 17519411
22899653	Influence of common genetic variation on lung cancer risk: meta-analysis of 14 900 cases and 29 485 controls.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common genetic variants at 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22 and 15q25.1 associated with lung cancer risk. Several other genetic regions including variants of CHEK2 (22q12), TP53BP1 (15q15) and RAD52 (12p13) have been demonstrated to influence lung cancer risk in candidate- or pathway-based analyses. To identify novel risk variants for lung cancer, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 GWASs, totaling 14 900 cases and 29 485 controls of European descent. Our data provided increased support for previously identified risk loci at 5p15 (P = 7.2 × 10(-16)), 6p21 (P = 2.3 × 10(-14)) and 15q25 (P = 2.2 × 10(-63)). Furthermore, we demonstrated histology-specific effects for 5p15, 6p21 and 12p13 loci but not for the 15q25 region. Subgroup analysis also identified a novel disease locus for squamous cell carcinoma at 9p21 (CDKN2A/p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF)/CDKN2B/p15(INK4B)/ANRIL; rs1333040, P = 3.0 × 10(-7)) which was replicated in a series of 5415 Han Chinese (P = 0.03; combined analysis, P = 2.3 × 10(-8)). This large analysis provides additional evidence for the role of inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and insight into biological differences in the development of the different histological types of lung cancer.	 20106900 20372852 20386740 20418889 20581827 20548021 19945765 20601957 20700436 11584289 11782049 12015775 12496042 12958120 15052270 15286464 8137335 8205268 7987387 7834619 7606711 9624535 15761078 16228001 16273220 20634204 21725308 21966413 22054876 21971053 22330686 22585858 22052329 22820512 18997786 20871597 20584212 21058334 20876614 21071405 20956613 21303977 21378990 21412013 20951091 21151178 21532571 21407268 21573907 21743972 11242102 16287848 16054167 16155052 16564601 16311244 16741161 16921403 16925834 17403783 17384015 17517688 17701901 18185590 18281249 18385738 18385739 18256286 18385676 18483334 18449888 18538025 18715499 18988837 18978787 18978790 19424496 19543373 19238334 19401414 19578366 19578367 19465454 19654303 19706272 19715440 19592466 19888323 19836008 19934774
22916037	Novel Loci for metabolic networks and multi-tissue expression studies reveal genes for atherosclerosis.	Association testing of multiple correlated phenotypes offers better power than univariate analysis of single traits. We analyzed 6,600 individuals from two population-based cohorts with both genome-wide SNP data and serum metabolomic profiles. From the observed correlation structure of 130 metabolites measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, we identified 11 metabolic networks and performed a multivariate genome-wide association analysis. We identified 34 genomic loci at genome-wide significance, of which 7 are novel. In comparison to univariate tests, multivariate association analysis identified nearly twice as many significant associations in total. Multi-tissue gene expression studies identified variants in our top loci, SERPINA1 and AQP9, as eQTLs and showed that SERPINA1 and AQP9 expression in human blood was associated with metabolites from their corresponding metabolic networks. Finally, liver expression of AQP9 was associated with atherosclerotic lesion area in mice, and in human arterial tissue both SERPINA1 and AQP9 were shown to be upregulated (6.3-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively) in atherosclerotic plaques. Our study illustrates the power of multi-phenotype GWAS and highlights candidate genes for atherosclerosis.	 18263651 19043545 19060910 19005011 19132087 19356715 19253070 19474294 19543373 19597491 19680538 19684899 19715440 19417089 20037589 20354512 20197298 20525181 20538623 20686565 20844574 20941391 20864672 20860408 20876357 21179014 21289260 21423183 21593864 21756023 21852963 21886157 22077970 22081610 22359512 22286219 10703799 11701469 11891617 14715251 14991056 4911003 7670967 8895468 9758596 16825664 17360690 17463246 19019849 17641228 17701901 17943122 18024473 18348202 18451265 18462017 18689903 18852723
22903471	Genome-wide association identifies genetic variants associated with lentiform nucleus volume in N = 1345 young and elderly subjects.	Deficits in lentiform nucleus volume and morphometry are implicated in a number of genetically influenced disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Here we performed genome-wide searches to discover common genetic variants associated with differences in lentiform nucleus volume in human populations. We assessed structural MRI scans of the brain in two large genotyped samples: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 706) and the Queensland Twin Imaging Study (QTIM; N = 639). Statistics of association from each cohort were combined meta-analytically using a fixed-effects model to boost power and to reduce the prevalence of false positive findings. We identified a number of associations in and around the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) gene cluster. The most highly associated SNP, rs1795240, was located in the FMO3 gene; after meta-analysis, it showed genome-wide significant evidence of association with lentiform nucleus volume (P MA  = 4.79 × 10(-8)). This commonly-carried genetic variant accounted for 2.68 % and 0.84 % of the trait variability in the ADNI and QTIM samples, respectively, even though the QTIM sample was on average 50 years younger. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant contributions of this gene to the cytochrome P450 pathway, which is involved in metabolizing numerous therapeutic drugs for pain, seizures, mania, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. The genetic variants we identified provide replicated, genome-wide significant evidence for the FMO gene cluster's involvement in lentiform nucleus volume differences in human populations.	 22504421 22504417 10078503 10950857 11052215 11063978 11072261 11809920 12130684 12228178 12383780 12391568 12511860 14561615 15304429 15488422 15501092 5457503 6229162 3526177 2456581 2497479 1832073 7909412 8091226 7749747 8660127 8840349 9305407 15922018 15724142 16863467 17050781 17415783 17554300 17924335 18061429 18398418 18464046 18590567 18381902 18762588 19303260 19634211 19721106 19786105 20197096 20577206 20185149 20162602 21058334 21217833 21397060 21352927 21565292 21531904 22461613 22723713

22911880	Genome-wide association analysis of eating disorder-related symptoms, behaviors, and personality traits.	Eating disorders (EDs) are common, complex psychiatric disorders thought to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. They share many symptoms, behaviors, and personality traits, which may have overlapping heritability. The aim of the present study is to perform a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) of six ED phenotypes comprising three symptom traits from the Eating Disorders Inventory 2 [Drive for Thinness (DT), Body Dissatisfaction (BD), and Bulimia], Weight Fluctuation symptom, Breakfast Skipping behavior and Childhood Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder trait (CHIRP). Investigated traits were derived from standardized self-report questionnaires completed by the TwinsUK population-based cohort. We tested 283,744 directly typed SNPs across six phenotypes of interest in the TwinsUK discovery dataset and followed-up signals from various strata using a two-stage replication strategy in two independent cohorts of European ancestry. We meta-analyzed a total of 2,698 individuals for DT, 2,680 for BD, 2,789 (821 cases/1,968 controls) for Bulimia, 1,360 (633 cases/727 controls) for Childhood Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder trait, 2,773 (761 cases/2,012 controls) for Breakfast Skipping, and 2,967 (798 cases/2,169 controls) for Weight Fluctuation symptom. In this GWAS analysis of six ED-related phenotypes, we detected association of eight genetic variants with P < 10(-5) . Genetic variants that showed suggestive evidence of association were previously associated with several psychiatric disorders and ED-related phenotypes. Our study indicates that larger-scale collaborative studies will be needed to achieve the necessary power to detect loci underlying ED-related traits.	 10698815 21670730 11799475 11912184 12110693 12476400 12562569 12668349 12821884 14994957 15135333 15203775 15319573 15330074 2330389 2005275 1586361 8245136 7997699 7802123 9672050 10232302 15822080 16152574 16231356 16978446 17573683 18444228 18613211 19040268 19481926 19733727 19744759 19680270 19704409 19931559 19931176 20039379 20372150 20418890 20468064 20677014 21070662 21243475 21586274 21831918 21079607 21621269 22073261 10762095
23067351	High density GWAS for LDL cholesterol in African Americans using electronic medical records reveals a strong protective variant in APOE.	Only one low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been previously reported in -African Americans. We performed a GWAS of LDL-C in African Americans using data extracted from electronic medical records (EMR) in the eMERGE network. African Americans were genotyped on the Illumina 1M chip. All LDL-C measurements, prescriptions, and diagnoses of concomitant disease were extracted from EMR. We created two analytic datasets; one dataset having median LDL-C calculated after the exclusion of some lab values based on comorbidities and medication (n= 618) and another dataset having median LDL-C calculated without any exclusions (n= 1,249). SNP rs7412 in APOE was strongly associated with LDL-C in both datasets (p < 5 × 10(-8) ). In the dataset with exclusions, a decrease of 20.0 mg/dL per minor allele was observed. The effect size was attenuated (12.3 mg/dL) in the dataset without any lab values excluded. Although other signals in APOE have been detected in previous GWAS, this large and important SNP association has not been well detected in large GWAS because rs7412 was not included on many genotyping arrays. Use of median LDL-C extracted from EMR after exclusions for medications and comorbidities increased the percentage of trait variance explained by genetic variation.	 17878422 18193043 18193044 18974171 19060906 19060910 21589926 21700265 21829380 21981779 22125226 22101970 17701901 17194218 16862161 1619388 3277611 21508311 21347282 21269473 21234875 21041692 20839289 20498921 20819866 20686565 20529013 20406466 22037903 19060911 20362271

22923054	A genome-wide association study of breast cancer in women of African ancestry.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in diverse populations are needed to reveal variants that are more common and/or limited to defined populations. We conducted a GWAS of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, with genotyping of >1,000,000 SNPs in 3,153 African American cases and 2,831 controls, and replication testing of the top 66 associations in an additional 3,607 breast cancer cases and 11,330 controls of African ancestry. Two of the 66 SNPs replicated (p < 0.05) in stage 2, which reached statistical significance levels of 10(-6) and 10(-5) in the stage 1 and 2 combined analysis (rs4322600 at chromosome 14q31: OR = 1.18, p = 4.3 × 10(-6); rs10510333 at chromosome 3p26: OR = 1.15, p = 1.5 × 10(-5)). These suggestive risk loci have not been identified in previous GWAS in other populations and will need to be examined in additional samples. Identification of novel risk variants for breast cancer in women of African ancestry will demand testing of a substantially larger set of markers from stage 1 in a larger replication sample.	 19219042 18593304 21852243 22037553 22267197 22383897 22357627 22508544 22452962 10835412 11984562 15065660 7605428 16862161 17056248 17529973 19330027 19330030 19543370 19789366 20406955 20453838 20852631 21102626 21263130 21541012 21602798 21795501 17529974 17529967 18438407 18462018 19223389
22922875	Genome-wide association analyses identify three new susceptibility loci for primary angle closure glaucoma.	Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study including 1,854 PACG cases and 9,608 controls across 5 sample collections in Asia. Replication experiments were conducted in 1,917 PACG cases and 8,943 controls collected from a further 6 sample collections. We report significant associations at three new loci: rs11024102 in PLEKHA7 (per-allele odds ratio (OR)=1.22; P=5.33×10(-12)), rs3753841 in COL11A1 (per-allele OR=1.20; P=9.22×10(-10)) and rs1015213 located between PCMTD1 and ST18 on chromosome 8q (per-allele OR=1.50; P=3.29×10(-9)). Our findings, accumulated across these independent worldwide collections, suggest possible mechanisms explaining the pathogenesis of PACG.	 8872475 9792868 10353778 15489893 15761122 15976030 20981092 22306652 21035870 21399633 21532571 21655354 16168081 16488940 16547337 17701901 17924146 18385801 18469193 18676404 19041755 19295366 19330030 19525955 19561604 19561607 19700652 20062062 19923002 20571587 20694013 20808826 19430479 20835238 21685912 21743467 21833088 21897747 21874001 21873608 22081228 22267197 22306651 21292315 10711672 10711890 10964834 11673284 11673287 11709013 12499305 12642298 12671473 5058710 1589856 7704921
22952603	Genome-wide association study of d-amphetamine response in healthy volunteers identifies putative associations, including cadherin 13 (CDH13).	Both the subjective response to d-amphetamine and the risk for amphetamine addiction are known to be heritable traits. Because subjective responses to drugs may predict drug addiction, identifying alleles that influence acute response may also provide insight into the genetic risk factors for drug abuse. We performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for the subjective responses to amphetamine in 381 non-drug abusing healthy volunteers. Responses to amphetamine were measured using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. We used sparse factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data to ten factors. We identified several putative associations; the strongest was between a positive subjective drug-response factor and a SNP (rs3784943) in the 8(th) intron of cadherin 13 (CDH13; P = 4.58×10(-8)), a gene previously associated with a number of psychiatric traits including methamphetamine dependence. Additionally, we observed a putative association between a factor representing the degree of positive affect at baseline and a SNP (rs472402) in the 1(st) intron of steroid-5-alpha-reductase-α-polypeptide-1 (SRD5A1; P = 2.53×10(-7)), a gene whose protein product catalyzes the rate-limiting step in synthesis of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone. This SNP belongs to an LD-block that has been previously associated with the expression of SRD5A1 and differences in SRD5A1 enzymatic activity. The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the genetic basis of subjective responses to stimulant drugs using a GWAS approach in a modestly sized sample. Our approach provides a case study for analysis of high-dimensional intermediate pharmacogenomic phenotypes, which may be more tractable than clinical diagnoses.	 17239355 17572673 17676998 17194218 17701890 17874879 17943122 17982585 18316681 18535201 18776909 18839057 18821565 18988193 19057666 19009022 19543373 19581569 20502693 20732627 20862358 20887962 20800221 20981092 20876611 19663900 20195266 21464363 21323680 21368711 21785431 20091113 20235792 20300088 20418888 20360315 20421487 20414144 18957941 19727679 19968402 19890266 20158297 10737605 11500251 11744070 12716966 12959783 14557149 14644065 14732415 15160637 6779334 6891082 6685963 2992898 1679387 22170288 21502966 22212596 22795700 7688765 8296886 9151931 15602501 16155734 16237383 16823800 16966188 16984997 16894614 17099884 16814490 21818250 21659334 21849985 21815997 22064162 21173776 17189563 17407593 17344241
22939635	Genome-wide association and population genetic analysis of C-reactive protein in African American and Hispanic American women.	C-reactive protein (CRP) is a systemic inflammation marker that predicts future cardiovascular risk. CRP levels are higher in African Americans and Hispanic Americans than in European Americans, but the genetic determinants of CRP in these admixed United States minority populations are largely unknown. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 8,280 African American (AA) and 3,548 Hispanic American (HA) postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource. We discovered and validated a CRP-associated variant of triggering receptors expressed by myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in chromosomal region 6p21 (p = 10(-10)). The TREM2 variant associated with higher CRP is common in Africa but rare in other ancestral populations. In AA women, the CRP region in 1q23 contained a strong admixture association signal (p = 10(-17)), which appears to be related to several independent CRP-associated alleles; the strongest of these is present only in African ancestral populations and is associated with higher CRP. Of the other genomic loci previously associated with CRP through GWASs of European populations, most loci (LEPR, IL1RN, IL6R, GCKR, NLRP3, HNF1A, HNF4A, and APOC1) showed consistent patterns of association with CRP in AA and HA women. In summary, we have identified a common TREM2 variant associated with CRP in United States minority populations. The genetic architecture underlying the CRP phenotype in AA women is complex and involves genetic variants shared across populations, as well as variants specific to populations of African descent.	 14505774 12921979 14685227 15135696 15257999 6386656 15769763 15712363 15897982 16053959 16159603 16216995 16773560 16862161 16880331 16923436 17101857 17299196 17701901 18379563 18348202 18439548 18805107 18926286 18997194 19230638 19643839 20137780 20502693 20616382 20876875 21058334 21330547 21300955 21196492 21285387 21457909 22194699 22291609 22169128 22421340 22492993 22179539 10762551 11257270 11753822 11954565 12080485 12551878 12645956 12881452 14575939
22936694	Genome-wide association study identifies a new locus JMJD1C at 10q21 that may influence serum androgen levels in men.	Circulating androgen levels are often used as indicators of physiological or pathological conditions. More than half of the variance for circulating androgen levels is thought to be genetically influenced. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified two loci, SHBG at 17p13 and FAM9B at Xp22, for serum testosterone (T) levels; however, these explain only a small fraction of inter-individual variability. To identify additional genetic determinants of androgen levels, a GWAS of baseline serum T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels was conducted in 3225 men of European ancestry from the REduction by DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study. Cross-validation was used to confirm the observed associations between the drug (n = 1581) and placebo (n = 1644) groups of REDUCE. In addition to confirming the associations of two known loci with serum T levels (rs727428 in SHBG: P = 1.26 × 10(-12); rs5934505 in FAM9B: P = 1.61 × 10(-8)), we identified a new locus, JMJD1C at 10q21 that was associated with serum T levels at a genome-wide significance level (rs10822184: P = 1.12 × 10(-8)). We also observed that the SHBG locus was associated with serum DHT levels (rs727428: P = 1.47 × 10(-11)). Moreover, two additional variants in SHBG [rs72829446, in strong linkage equilibrium with the missense variant D356N (rs6259), and rs1799941] were also independently associated with circulating androgen levels in a statistical scale. These three loci (JMJD1C, SHBG and FAM9B) were estimated to account for ~5.3 and 4.1% of the variance of serum T and DHT levels. Our findings may provide new insights into the regulation of circulating androgens and potential targets for androgen-based therapy.	 15371831 15199113 3549275 9435448 15635498 15634719 15755867 11473114 16537739 16862161 16926255 17572673 17569675 17701901 18230794 18056923 18464913 18430151 18842992 18940312 19064566 18681858 19574343 19657112 19936222 19698759 20357281 20173016 20186052 20686565 20530532 20870782 21252242 21177660 21998597 22829776 12213195 12746247 14764814 6750727
22936669	A genome-wide association study on a southern European population identifies a new Crohn's disease susceptibility locus at RBX1-EP300.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk loci for Crohn's disease (CD). However, the cumulative risk exerted by these loci is low, and the likelihood that additional, as-yet undiscovered loci contribute to the risk of CD is very high. We performed a GWAS on a southern European population to identify new CD risk loci.	
22936702	Genome-wide association analysis reveals 12q13.3-q14.1 as new risk locus for sarcoidosis.	Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology, influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, the loci so far identified for sarcoidosis explain only a part of its assumed heritability. To identify further susceptibility loci, we performed a genome-wide association analysis using the Affymetrix 6.0 Human GeneChip followed by validation and replication stages. After quality control, 637 cases, 1233 controls and 677 619 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available for an initial screening. 99 SNPs were selected for validation in an independent study panel (1664 patients, 2932 controls). SNP rs1050045 was significantly associated with sarcoidosis (corrected p=0.0215) in the validation panel and yielded a p-value of 9.22 × 10(-8) (OR 1.24) in the meta-analysis of the screening and validation stage. A meta-analysis of three populations from Germany, the Czech Republic and Sweden confirmed this finding (p = 0.024; OR 1.14). Fine-mapping and mRNA expression studies pointed to osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS9) as the most likely candidate for the underlying risk factor. The OS9 protein plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation and acts during Toll-like receptor induced activation of myeloid cells. Expression analyses of OS9 mRNA provide evidence for a functional mechanism underlying the detected association signal.	
22960237	Bivariate genome-wide association study suggests fatty acid desaturase genes and cadherin DCHS2 for variation of both compressive strength index and appendicular lean mass in males.	Compressive strength index (CSI) is a newly established index for predicting hip fracture, the most serious consequence of osteoporosis. Appendicular lean mass (ALM), which influences skeletal strength of the lower limbs, is another trait associated with the risk of hip fracture. In this study, we performed a bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify new candidate genes responsible for both CSI and ALM. In our discovery sample of 1627 unrelated Chinese subjects (802 males and 825 females), we scanned 909,509 SNPs using the Affymetrix Human Genome SNP 6.0 genotyping array. We successfully replicated our results in a sample of 2286 Caucasian subjects (558 males and 1728 females). The results indicated that five SNPs (rs174583, rs174577, rs174549, rs174548, rs7672337) in the FADS1, FADS2, and DCHS2 genes had significant bivariate associations with CSI and ALM in male subjects for both the GWAS discovery (with P<8.42×10(-6)) and the Caucasian sample (with P<0.07). We performed further replication analysis in a 2nd Caucasian sample with 501 Caucasian male subjects, using Affymetrix 500k arrays, and found that two of the above SNPs (rs174548 and rs174549, P=0.07) had bivariate associations with both CSI and ALM in males; the other 3 SNPs were not typed with the 500k array. The above findings suggest that the 3 genes, FADS1, FADS2, and DCHS2, containing these SNPs might play dual roles influencing both CSI and ALM in males. Our findings provide new insights into our understanding of the genetic basis of bone metabolism and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.	
22885922	Large-scale association analysis provides insights into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.	To extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip, including 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent. We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two showing sex-differentiated association. Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of additional common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D. Exploration of the enlarged set of susceptibility loci implicates several processes, including CREBBP-related transcription, adipocytokine signaling and cell cycle regulation, in diabetes pathogenesis.	 20081857 20418489 20126254 20174558 21249183 21376301 21775993 21874001 22158537 22426310 22446960 20195508 22885924 20562875 20581827 20668294 20686565 20714348 20811451 19430480 20862305 20865176 20818381 20935629 20935630 20981092 21104887 20858683 20795936 11315092 12710672 12824425 14764746 15502828 10319860 15654335 15823385 17344885 17463249 17786212 17943122 18200017 18344981 18372903 18454146 18454148 18762020 19104045 18711366 19183934 19557189 19849800 20016592 22876189 20081858
22881374	Genome-wide association and linkage study in the Amish detects a novel candidate late-onset Alzheimer disease gene.	To identify novel late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) risk genes, we have analysed Amish populations of Ohio and Indiana. We performed genome-wide SNP linkage and association studies on 798 individuals (109 with LOAD). We tested association using the Modified Quasi-Likelihood Score test and also performed two-point and multipoint linkage analyses. We found that LOAD was significantly associated with APOE (P= 9.0 × 10-6) in all our ascertainment regions except for the Adams County, Indiana, community (P= 0.55). Genome-wide, the most strongly associated SNP was rs12361953 (P= 7.92 × 10-7). A very strong, genome-wide significant multipoint peak [recessive heterogeneity multipoint LOD (HLOD) = 6.14, dominant HLOD = 6.05] was detected on 2p12. Three additional loci with multipoint HLOD scores >3 were detected on 3q26, 9q31 and 18p11. Converging linkage and association results, the most significantly associated SNP under the 2p12 peak was at rs2974151 (P= 1.29 × 10-4). This SNP is located in CTNNA2, which encodes catenin alpha 2, a neuronal-specific catenin known to have function in the developing brain. These results identify CTNNA2 as a novel candidate LOAD gene, and implicate three other regions of the genome as novel LOAD loci. These results underscore the utility of using family-based linkage and association analyses in isolated populations to identify novel loci for traits with complex genetic architecture.	 11731797 21668908 12089526 12888984 6610841 3611032 2771064 8651641 9790190 10449652 16093727 16389594 16515697 17044871 17564960 17668381 17725986 18301450 18776909 19734902 19734903 20460622 21460840 20955934 21460841 11877549
22885689	Genome-wide association study of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees.	The authors used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiply affected families to investigate the association of schizophrenia to common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and rare copy number variants (CNVs).	
22941191	Common variation at 6q16 within HACE1 and LIN28B influences susceptibility to neuroblastoma.	Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of 2,817 neuroblastoma cases and 7,473 controls. We identified two new associations at 6q16, the first within HACE1 (rs4336470; combined P=2.7×10(-11); odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.35) and the second within LIN28B (rs17065417; combined P=1.2×10(-8); odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54). Expression of LIN28B and let-7 miRNA correlated with rs17065417 genotype in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we observed significant growth inhibition upon depletion of LIN28B, specifically in neuroblastoma cells that were homozygous for the risk allele. Low HACE1 and high LIN28B expression in diagnostic primary neuroblastomas were associated with worse overall survival (P=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). Taken together, these data show that common variants in HACE1 and LIN28B influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and indicate that both genes likely have a role in disease progression.	 19350571 18630515 20558371 18463370 19412175 22384356 19948536 15024693 8336186 21962509 22118463 19483683 15254018 15338462 21436895 10421273 11420745 20398887 17572673 19578360 21124317 19448622 19536264 21482675 19448623 17694067 20616382 18029452 18505919 16369550 19878981 2066755 20054295 18628472 18923523 20621047 15838508 19528486 20634204 22328350 20879881 22350409 22345399 19543373 21098321 18724359
22941190	Common variants at 6p21.1 are associated with large artery atherosclerotic stroke.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not consistently detected replicable genetic risk factors for ischemic stroke, potentially due to etiological heterogeneity of this trait. We performed GWAS of ischemic stroke and a major ischemic stroke subtype (large artery atherosclerosis, LAA) using 1,162 ischemic stroke cases (including 421 LAA cases) and 1,244 population controls from Australia. Evidence for a genetic influence on ischemic stroke risk was detected, but this influence was higher and more significant for the LAA subtype. We identified a new LAA susceptibility locus on chromosome 6p21.1 (rs556621: odds ratio (OR)=1.62, P=3.9×10(-8)) and replicated this association in 1,715 LAA cases and 52,695 population controls from 10 independent population cohorts (meta-analysis replication OR=1.15, P=3.9×10(-4); discovery and replication combined OR=1.21, P=4.7×10(-8)). This study identifies a genetic risk locus for LAA and shows how analyzing etiological subtypes may better identify genetic risk alleles for ischemic stroke.	 10946010 21376301 11944986 12574549 12714707 14684773 14718359 7678184 9626291 10233894 15569868 15528878 15297300 15749026 17239805 18199855 18382088 18852200 18991354 19233729 19141561 19361613 19295514 19715440 20031580 20159873 20562875 20561675 20634204 21058334 20056765 21167468 21151130 22306652 11374903
22949513	Genome-wide association analysis of genetic generalized epilepsies implicates susceptibility loci at 1q43, 2p16.1, 2q22.3 and 17q21.32.	Genetic generalized epilepsies (GGEs) have a lifetime prevalence of 0.3% and account for 20-30% of all epilepsies. Despite their high heritability of 80%, the genetic factors predisposing to GGEs remain elusive. To identify susceptibility variants shared across common GGE syndromes, we carried out a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 3020 patients with GGEs and 3954 controls of European ancestry. To dissect out syndrome-related variants, we also explored two distinct GGE subgroups comprising 1434 patients with genetic absence epilepsies (GAEs) and 1134 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Joint Stage-1 and 2 analyses revealed genome-wide significant associations for GGEs at 2p16.1 (rs13026414, P(meta) = 2.5 × 10(-9), OR[T] = 0.81) and 17q21.32 (rs72823592, P(meta) = 9.3 × 10(-9), OR[A] = 0.77). The search for syndrome-related susceptibility alleles identified significant associations for GAEs at 2q22.3 (rs10496964, P(meta) = 9.1 × 10(-9), OR[T] = 0.68) and at 1q43 for JME (rs12059546, P(meta) = 4.1 × 10(-8), OR[G] = 1.42). Suggestive evidence for an association with GGEs was found in the region 2q24.3 (rs11890028, P(meta) = 4.0 × 10(-6)) nearby the SCN1A gene, which is currently the gene with the largest number of known epilepsy-related mutations. The associated regions harbor high-ranking candidate genes: CHRM3 at 1q43, VRK2 at 2p16.1, ZEB2 at 2q22.3, SCN1A at 2q24.3 and PNPO at 17q21.32. Further replication efforts are necessary to elucidate whether these positional candidate genes contribute to the heritability of the common GGE syndromes.	
22959728	Age of onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is modulated by a locus on 1p34.1.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the third most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. Individuals with ALS rapidly progress to paralysis and die from respiratory failure within 3 to 5 years after symptom onset. Epidemiological factors explain only a modest amount of the risk for ALS. However, there is growing evidence of a strong genetic component to both familial and sporadic ALS risk. The International Consortium on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetics was established to bring together existing genome-wide association cohorts and identify sporadic ALS susceptibility and age at symptom onset loci. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of the International Consortium on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetics genome-wide association samples, consisting of 4243 ALS cases and 5112 controls from 13 European ancestry cohorts from across the United States and Europe. Eight genomic regions provided evidence of association with ALS, including 9p21.2 (rs3849942, odds ratio [OR] = 1.21; p = 4.41 × 10(-7)), 17p11.2 (rs7477, OR = 1.30; p = 2.89 × 10(-7)), and 19p13 (rs12608932, OR = 1.37, p = 1.29 × 10(-7)). Six genomic regions were associated with age at onset of ALS. The strongest evidence for an age of onset locus was observed at 1p34.1, with comparable evidence at rs3011225 (R(2)(partial) = 0.0061; p = 6.59 × 10(-8)) and rs803675 (R(2)(partial) = 0.0060; p = 6.96 × 10(-8)). These associations were consistent across all 13 cohorts. For rs3011225, individuals with at least 1 copy of the minor allele had an earlier average age of onset of over 2 years. Identifying the underlying pathways influencing susceptibility to and age at onset of ALS may provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms and motivate new pharmacologic targets for this fatal neurodegenerative disease.	 7951249 15372378 15657798 16024886 16834713 17219036 17261678 17296840 17362836 17549529 17671248 17827064 18079297 18084291 18268245 18057069 18309045 18608099 18996185 19251627 19251628 18608094 19193627 19451621 19670447 19734901 19917993 20007371 20460622 20428114 20485568 20549870 20566859 20225930 20801717 20801718 20861059 21145000 21702733 21857683 21846995 21944778 21944779 21933809 10737125 11381259 11676986 10025778
22961080	A genome-wide association study identifies GRK5 and RASGRP1 as type 2 diabetes loci in Chinese Hans.	Substantial progress has been made in identification of type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci in the past few years, but our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D in ethnically diverse populations remains limited. We performed a genome-wide association study and a replication study in Chinese Hans comprising 8,569 T2D case subjects and 8,923 control subjects in total, from which 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected for further follow-up in a de novo replication sample of 3,410 T2D case and 3,412 control subjects and an in silico replication sample of 6,952 T2D case and 11,865 control subjects. Besides confirming seven established T2D loci (CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, KCNQ1, CDC123, GLIS3, HNF1B, and DUSP9) at genome-wide significance, we identified two novel T2D loci, including G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) (rs10886471: P = 7.1 × 10(-9)) and RASGRP1 (rs7403531: P = 3.9 × 10(-9)), of which the association signal at GRK5 seems to be specific to East Asians. In nondiabetic individuals, the T2D risk-increasing allele of RASGRP1-rs7403531 was also associated with higher HbA(1c) and lower homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (P = 0.03 and 0.0209, respectively), whereas the T2D risk-increasing allele of GRK5-rs10886471 was also associated with higher fasting insulin (P = 0.0169) but not with fasting glucose. Our findings not only provide new insights into the pathophysiology of T2D, but may also shed light on the ethnic differences in T2D susceptibility.	 17463246 20818381 10064092 19465406 16862161 19933860 12111919 19996363 20862305 11017103 17463249 18034461 21779502 9516468 21778616 9839117 19875164 21753830 17572673 20335585 22132883 20945396 8866565 20581827 18711367 21957144 22158537 12932358 14744114 20308177 21617109 17463248 18711366 16530850 12433368 21747906 22001118 21304890 18633108 17701901 18372903 16301621 16980301 20174558 19060909 19146692 18441336 17190838 21728385
22951725	Association analyses identify three susceptibility Loci for vitiligo in the Chinese Han population.	To identify susceptibility loci for vitiligo, we extended our previous vitiligo genome-wide association study with a two-staged replication study that included 6,857 cases and 12,025 controls from the Chinese Han population. We identified three susceptibility loci, 12q13.2 (rs10876864, P(combined)=8.07 × 10(-12), odds ratio (OR)=1.18), 11q23.3 (rs638893, P(combined)=2.47 × 10(-9), OR=1.22), and 10q22.1 (rs1417210, P(combined)=1.83 × 10(-8), OR=0.88), and confirmed three previously reported loci for vitiligo, 3q28 (rs9851967, P(combined)=8.57 × 10(-8), OR=0.88), 10p15.1 (rs3134883, P(combined)=1.01 × 10(-5), OR=1.11), and 22q12.3 (rs2051582, P(combined)=2.12 × 10(-5), OR=1.14), in the Chinese Han population. The most significant single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 12q13.2 locus is located immediately upstream of the promoter region of PMEL, which encodes a major melanocyte antigen and has expression loss in the vitiligo lesional skin. In addition, both 12q13.2 and 11q23.3 loci identified in this study are also associated with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings provide indirect support that vitiligo pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between immune regulatory factors and melanocyte-specific factors. They also highlight similarities and differences in the genetic basis of vitiligo in Chinese and Caucasian populations.

22951594	A genome-wide association study identifies a genetic variant in the SIAH2 locus associated with hormonal receptor-positive breast cancer in Japanese.	In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. To identify genetic variants associated with the disease susceptibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a total of 1086 Japanese female patients with hormonal receptor-positive (HRP) breast cancer and 1816 female controls. We selected 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive associations in GWAS (P-value of <1 × 10(-4)) as well as 4 SNPs that were previously implicated their association with breast cancer for further replication by an independent set of 1653 cases and 2797 controls. We identified significant association of the disease with a SNP rs6788895 (P(combined) of 9.43 × 10(-8) with odds ratio (OR) of 1.22) in the SIAH2 (intron of seven in absentia homolog 2) gene on chromosome 3q25.1 where the involvement in estrogen-dependent diseases was suggested. In addition, rs3750817 in intron 2 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene, which was reported to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility, was significantly replicated with P(combined) of 8.47 × 10(-8) with OR=1.22. Our results suggest a novel susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q25.1 for a HRP breast cancer.

Intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) synthesis is frequently observed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Whereas the extent of intrathecal IgG synthesis varies largely between patients, it remains rather constant in the individual patient over time. The aim of this study was to identify common genetic variants associated with the IgG index as a marker of intrathecal IgG synthesis in MS.	 3941297 19151095 10528220 18970977 20558389 10589540 17492755 6787085 12067234 18272891 7359146 11730948 10852535 16694947 16945427 17703228 11781688 20073133 22047971 3091773 2678429 4042430 6713741 15800022 20634204 3876966 4623296 17701901 21833088 21868488 17660530 15771584 19636712 11006371 2408558 17444504 18542080 21840891 17846036 9485065 10831771 11320183 9546327

22961001	Common variants at the MHC locus and at chromosome 16q24.1 predispose to Barrett's esophagus.	Barrett's esophagus is an increasingly common disease that is strongly associated with reflux of stomach acid and usually a hiatus hernia, and it strongly predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a tumor with a very poor prognosis. We report the first genome-wide association study on Barrett's esophagus, comprising 1,852 UK cases and 5,172 UK controls in the discovery stage and 5,986 cases and 12,825 controls in the replication stage. Variants at two loci were associated with disease risk: chromosome 6p21, rs9257809 (Pcombined=4.09×10(-9); odds ratio (OR)=1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-1.28), within the major histocompatibility complex locus, and chromosome 16q24, rs9936833 (Pcombined=2.74×10(-10); OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.10-1.19), for which the closest protein-coding gene is FOXF1, which is implicated in esophageal development and structure. We found evidence that many common variants of small effect contribute to genetic susceptibility to Barrett's esophagus and that SNP alleles predisposing to obesity also increase risk for Barrett's esophagus.	 11145505 20881960 11821356 11845805 12171951 12190150 12865263 12960209 15152957 15246126 10235188 16344051 16793832 16985029 17101315 17846035 17900269 18062791 17925001 18454148 18403496 19543373 19557161 19557197 19571811 19770374 19851442 19850156 20200424 20549505 20833742 20935630 20953190 20972440 21044948 21266807 21300701 21643038 21833088 21345260 22057235 21829225 22428928 22537613 11315092
22960999	Genome-wide association analyses of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese identify multiple susceptibility loci and gene-environment interactions.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) in 2,031 affected individuals (cases) and 2,044 controls with independent validation in 8,092 cases and 8,620 controls. We identified nine new ESCC susceptibility loci, of which seven, at chromosomes 4q23, 16q12.1, 17q21, 22q12, 3q27, 17p13 and 18p11, had a significant marginal effect (P=1.78×10(-39) to P=2.49×10(-11)) and two of which, at 2q22 and 13q33, had a significant association only in the gene-alcohol drinking interaction (gene-environment interaction P (PG×E)=4.39×10(-11) and PG×E=4.80×10(-8), respectively). Variants at the 4q23 locus, which includes the ADH cluster, each had a significant interaction with alcohol drinking in their association with ESCC risk (PG×E=2.54×10(-7) to PG×E=3.23×10(-2)). We confirmed the known association of the ALDH2 locus on 12q24 to ESCC, and a joint analysis showed that drinkers with both of the ADH1B and ALDH2 risk alleles had a fourfold increased risk for ESCC compared to drinkers without these risk alleles. Our results underscore the direct genetic contribution to ESCC risk, as well as the genetic contribution to ESCC through interaction with alcohol consumption.	 11967536 20131315 12397650 12672787 12930761 13130116 15054463 15492928 6992989 7167171 8217613 15455378 15604236 15761078 16862161 17086182 17040931 17517688 18488030 18520036 18596976 18852200 19327566 19534025 19458037 19656375 19698717 20562874
22982992	FTO genotype is associated with phenotypic variability of body mass index.	There is evidence across several species for genetic control of phenotypic variation of complex traits, such that the variance among phenotypes is genotype dependent. Understanding genetic control of variability is important in evolutionary biology, agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of phenotypic variation using ∼170,000 samples on height and body mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype), is also associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7%, corresponding to a difference of ∼0.5 kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI, possibly mediated by DNA methylation. Our BMI results for other SNPs and our height results for all SNPs suggest that most genetic variants, including those that influence mean height or mean BMI, are not associated with phenotypic variance, or that their effects on variability are too small to detect even with samples sizes greater than 100,000.	 6684513 15611178 16108138 17434869 17384015 17496892 17572673 17943122 17942823 18404214 17658951 18779467 19061529 19439624 19710197 20585554 20428936 20616382 20634204 20881960 20935630 20942902 21058334 21124985 21429270 21467569 21980300 22069379 22002720 21994764 22235250 22234326 21392419 11315092
22976474	A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of breast cancer identifies two novel susceptibility loci at 6q14 and 20q11.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of breast cancer defined by hormone receptor status have revealed loci contributing to susceptibility of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative subtypes. To identify additional genetic variants for ER-negative breast cancer, we conducted the largest meta-analysis of ER-negative disease to date, comprising 4754 ER-negative cases and 31 663 controls from three GWAS: NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) (2188 ER-negative cases; 25 519 controls of European ancestry), Triple Negative Breast Cancer Consortium (TNBCC) (1562 triple negative cases; 3399 controls of European ancestry) and African American Breast Cancer Consortium (AABC) (1004 ER-negative cases; 2745 controls). We performed in silico replication of 86 SNPs at P ≤ 1 × 10(-5) in an additional 11 209 breast cancer cases (946 with ER-negative disease) and 16 057 controls of Japanese, Latino and European ancestry. We identified two novel loci for breast cancer at 20q11 and 6q14. SNP rs2284378 at 20q11 was associated with ER-negative breast cancer (combined two-stage OR = 1.16; P = 1.1 × 10(-8)) but showed a weaker association with overall breast cancer (OR = 1.08, P = 1.3 × 10(-6)) based on 17 869 cases and 43 745 controls and no association with ER-positive disease (OR = 1.01, P = 0.67) based on 9965 cases and 22 902 controls. Similarly, rs17530068 at 6q14 was associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.12; P = 1.1 × 10(-9)), and with both ER-positive (OR = 1.09; P = 1.5 × 10(-5)) and ER-negative (OR = 1.16, P = 2.5 × 10(-7)) disease. We also confirmed three known loci associated with ER-negative (19p13) and both ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer (6q25 and 12p11). Our results highlight the value of large-scale collaborative studies to identify novel breast cancer risk loci.	 20233392 19644074 20601102 20702402 20852631 20664631 21085629 21285145 21191117 21304890 21441907 21596841 21844186 21983787 22037553 22532805 22684628 6488142 17529973 17934201 18159056 18070814 18462017 18488027 18596976 19219042 19168544 20525248
22969067	Genetic variants near PDGFRA are associated with corneal curvature in Australians.	Irregularity in the corneal curvature (CC) is highly associated with various eye disorders such as keratoconus and myopia. The sample had limited power to find genomewide significant (5 × 10(-8)) hits but good power for replication. Thus, an attempt was made to test whether alleles in the FRAP1 and PDGFRA genes, recently found to be associated with CC in Asian populations, also influence CC in Australians of North European ancestry. Results of initial genomewide association studies (GWAS) for CC in Australians were also reported.	 11222516 22243964 11593451 11734523 11731797 12499305 12912692 14624719 15273935 7043871 9493273 10341956 15611866 15790884 15761122 16221758 16862161 17293876 17701901 18385047 17277756 19265028 19433716 19803772 19684013 20031227 19737878 20616382 20981092 21058334 21115973 21665993 21791589 11328733
23028341	Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects.	Complement C3 and C4 play key roles in the main physiological activities of complement system, and their deficiencies or over-expression are associated with many clinical infectious or immunity diseases. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for serum levels of C3 and C4. The first stage was conducted in 1,999 healthy Chinese men, and the second stage was performed in an additional 1,496 subjects. We identified two SNPs, rs3753394 in CFH gene and rs3745567 in C3 gene, that are significantly associated with serum C3 levels at a genome-wide significance level (P = 7.33 × 10(-11) and P = 1.83 × 10(-9), respectively). For C4, one large genomic region on chromosome 6p21.3 is significantly associated with serum C4 levels. Two SNPs (rs1052693 and rs11575839) were located in the MHC class I area that include HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B genes. Two SNPs (rs2075799 and rs2857009) were located 5' and 3' of C4 gene. The other four SNPs, rs2071278, rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428, were located in the MHC class II region that includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB genes. The combined P-values for those eight SNPs ranged from 3.19 × 10(-22) to 5.62 × 10(-97). HBsAg-positive subjects have significantly lower C3 and C4 protein concentrations compared with HBsAg-negative subjects (P<0.05). Our study is the first GWAS report which shows genetic components influence the levels of complement C3 and C4. Our significant findings provide novel insights of their related autoimmune, infectious diseases, and molecular mechanisms.	 18383369 18174230 18566738 18495794 19135723 19279649 19387462 20580617 21304890 21353261 22286218 10904114 11154921 11287977 11297706 11577377 12928427 15163532 16862161 16998491 17572673 17701901 18602340
23028356	Functional variants in NFKBIE and RTKN2 involved in activation of the NF-κB pathway are associated with rheumatoid arthritis in Japanese.	Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with a complex etiology, leading to inflammation of synovial tissue and joint destruction. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and two replication studies in the Japanese population (7,907 cases and 35,362 controls), we identified two gene loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility (NFKBIE at 6p21.1, rs2233434, odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 1.3 × 10(-15); RTKN2 at 10q21.2, rs3125734, OR = 1.20, P = 4.6 × 10(-9)). In addition to two functional non-synonymous SNPs in NFKBIE, we identified candidate causal SNPs with regulatory potential in NFKBIE and RTKN2 gene regions by integrating in silico analysis using public genome databases and subsequent in vitro analysis. Both of these genes are known to regulate the NF-κB pathway, and the risk alleles of the genes were implicated in the enhancement of NF-κB activity in our analyses. These results suggest that the NF-κB pathway plays a role in pathogenesis and would be a rational target for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.	 15208781 17540862 21460063 26124677 20453841 16791208 15504364 17982456 20190752 22291604 19715440 18794853 17053093 11396092 15060013 17289997 21336280 21841780 17804842 11438035 2041787 17804836 19165919 12833157 17603471 19503088 19644074 3358796 19160518 22307276 17554300 20716579 9315679 15492219 17701901 22057235 9135156 20981092 22446963 17873874 20702402 20453842 21441907

23000144	Genome-wide association study identifies TNFSF15 and POU2AF1 as susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis in the Japanese population.	For the identification of susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 963 Japanese individuals (487 PBC cases and 476 healthy controls) and in a subsequent replication study that included 1,402 other Japanese individuals (787 cases and 615 controls). In addition to the most significant susceptibility region, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), we identified two significant susceptibility loci, TNFSF15 (rs4979462) and POU2AF1 (rs4938534) (combined odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, p = 2.84 × 10(-14) for rs4979462, and combined OR = 1.39, p = 2.38 × 10(-8) for rs4938534). Among 21 non-HLA susceptibility loci for PBC identified in GWASs of individuals of European descent, three loci (IL7R, IKZF3, and CD80) showed significant associations (combined p = 3.66 × 10(-8), 3.66 × 10(-9), and 3.04 × 10(-9), respectively) and STAT4 and NFKB1 loci showed suggestive association with PBC (combined p = 1.11 × 10(-6) and 1.42 × 10(-7), respectively) in the Japanese population. These observations indicated the existence of ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility loci to PBC and the importance of TNF signaling and B cell differentiation for the development of PBC in individuals of European descent and Japanese individuals.	 21399635 20639880 21565264 21636646 22017439 21818367 22253840 22005588 22245904 22257840 10823830 12029063 12574333 14718515 15300581 7859290 10229183 16177252 16221758 16448545 16861304 16966713 17574818 18338776 18422820 18587394 18695938 18803882 18817904 19174806 19124533 19262684 19458352 19543369 19554543 20018961 20176734 20639879 21508983
22990020	Genome-wide association study for circulating levels of PAI-1 provides novel insights into its regulation.	We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify novel associations between genetic variants and circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) concentration, and examined functional implications of variants and genes that were discovered. A discovery meta-analysis was performed in 19 599 subjects, followed by replication analysis of genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 796 independent samples. We further examined associations with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, assessed the functional significance of the SNPs for gene expression in human tissues, and conducted RNA-silencing experiments for one novel association. We confirmed the association of the 4G/5G proxy SNP rs2227631 in the promoter region of SERPINE1 (7q22.1) and discovered genome-wide significant associations at 3 additional loci: chromosome 7q22.1 close to SERPINE1 (rs6976053, discovery P = 3.4 × 10(-10)); chromosome 11p15.2 within ARNTL (rs6486122, discovery P = 3.0 × 10(-8)); and chromosome 3p25.2 within PPARG (rs11128603, discovery P = 2.9 × 10(-8)). Replication was achieved for the 7q22.1 and 11p15.2 loci. There was nominal association with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease at ARNTL (P < .05). Functional studies identified MUC3 as a candidate gene for the second association signal on 7q22.1. In summary, SNPs in SERPINE1 and ARNTL and an SNP associated with the expression of MUC3 were robustly associated with circulating levels of PAI-1.	 10853003 11018023 11289722 11292061 11748101 11916936 12738229 15045127 3934538 2885513 3132963 1495992 7686395 7892190 8521498 9445260 9974413 10073956 15634264 16172282 16585388 16931789 17572673 17676998 17903294 18163520 19387897 20040588 20502693 20352162 20581827 20562444 20558613 20827270 21378988 21378990 11197396
22993228	Novel genetic variants associated with lumbar disc degeneration in northern Europeans: a meta-analysis of 4600 subjects.	Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is an important cause of low back pain, which is a common and costly problem. LDD is characterised by disc space narrowing and osteophyte growth at the circumference of the disc. To date, the agnostic search of the genome by genome-wide association (GWA) to identify common variants associated with LDD has not been fruitful. This study is the first GWA meta-analysis of LDD.	 15077255 2878228 22532803 11315092 20188730 19180518 10835412 17597095 16973787 10361670 17195216 16434160 8742201 11953971 1826598 18048587 21663851 19841454 10446874 15917859 17572673 8308778 17108825 17254428 21494699 1948392 10685810 20494819 20876472 21251332 10025932 20233392 21079645 17311902 21058334 20442857 15458958 17720722 19812666 17660224 20017989 20528505 19508968 16595436 19543373 20147869 19728115 18455228
23028342	New susceptibility loci associated with kidney disease in type 1 diabetes.	Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy (DN), is a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that requires dialysis treatment or kidney transplantation. In addition to the decrease in the quality of life, DN accounts for a large proportion of the excess mortality associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Whereas the degree of glycemia plays a pivotal role in DN, a subset of individuals with poorly controlled T1D do not develop DN. Furthermore, strong familial aggregation supports genetic susceptibility to DN. However, the genes and the molecular mechanisms behind the disease remain poorly understood, and current therapeutic strategies rarely result in reversal of DN. In the GEnetics of Nephropathy: an International Effort (GENIE) consortium, we have undertaken a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T1D DN comprising ~2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) imputed in 6,691 individuals. After additional genotyping of 41 top ranked SNPs representing 24 independent signals in 5,873 individuals, combined meta-analysis revealed association of two SNPs with ESRD: rs7583877 in the AFF3 gene (P = 1.2 × 10(-8)) and an intergenic SNP on chromosome 15q26 between the genes RGMA and MCTP2, rs12437854 (P = 2.0 × 10(-9)). Functional data suggest that AFF3 influences renal tubule fibrosis via the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1) pathway. The strongest association with DN as a primary phenotype was seen for an intronic SNP in the ERBB4 gene (rs7588550, P = 2.1 × 10(-7)), a gene with type 2 diabetes DN differential expression and in the same intron as a variant with cis-eQTL expression of ERBB4. All these detected associations represent new signals in the pathogenesis of DN.	 21654721 21701565 21909115 21659754 21693741 21896933 22076439 22266139 22403184 12039979 12079280 12203795 12372933 12582260 12824208 12824469 15331558 3993659 1992766 7617116 7477376 8555498 10026205 15788478 16284200 16862161 16632515 17701901 17761534 18193043 17980714 18480851 18794854 19017763 19142019 19252134 19487818 19359276 19718025 19805330 20081858 20056746 20383145 20383146 20150533 20498205 20714348 20937630 20616382 20634204 19430480 19430482 20595679 20935629 20978353 21323541 21335512 21355053 21330300 21537348
22990015	A genome-wide association study identifies a gene network of ADAMTS genes in the predisposition to pediatric stroke.	Pediatric stroke is a rare but highly penetrant disease with a strong genetic background. Although there are an increasing number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for stroke in adults, such studies for stroke of pediatric onset are lacking. Here we report the results of the first GWAS on pediatric stroke using a large cohort of 270 family-based trios. GWAS was performed using the Illumina 370 CNV single nucleotide polymorphisms array and analyzed using the transmission disequilibrium test as implemented in PLINK. An enrichment analysis was performed to identify additional true association signals among lower P value signals and searched for cumulatively associated genes within protein interaction data using dmGWAS. We observed clustering of association signals in 4 genes belonging to one family of metalloproteinases at high (ADAMTS12, P = 2.9 × 10(-6); ADAMTS2, P = 8.0 × 10(-6)) and moderate (ADAMTS13, P = 9.3 × 10(-4); ADAMTS17, P = 8.5 × 10(-4)) significance levels. Over-representation and gene-network analyses highlight the importance of the extracellular matrix in conjunction with members of the phosphoinositide and calcium signaling pathways in the susceptibility for pediatric stroke. Associated extracellular matrix components, such as ADAMTS proteins, in combination with misbalanced coagulation signals as unveiled by gene network analysis suggest a major role of postnatal vascular injury with subsequent thrombus formation as the leading cause of pediatric stroke.

23017229	Genome-wide association replicates the association of Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) polymorphisms with serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in Hispanic children.	Obesity is associated with a chronic low inflammatory state characterized by elevated levels of chemokines. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a member of the cysteine-cysteine (CC) chemokine family and is increased in obesity. The purpose of this study was to identify loci regulating serum MCP-1 in obese Hispanic children from the Viva La Familia Study. A genome-wide association (GWA) analysis was performed in 815 children, ages 4-19 years, using genotypes assayed with the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 BeadChips. All analyses were performed in SOLAR using a linear regression-based test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for the relatedness of family members via a kinship variance component. The strongest association for MCP-1 levels was found with a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12075, resulting in an amino acid substitution (Asp42Gly) in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) gene product (minor allele frequency=43.6%, p=1.3 × 10(-21)) on chromosome 1. Four other DARC SNPs were also significantly associated with MCP-1 levels (p<10(-16)-10(-6)). The Asp42Gly variant was associated with higher levels of MCP-1 and accounted for approximately 10% of its variability. In addition, MCP-1 levels were significantly associated with SNPs in chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) and caspase recruitment domain family, member 9 (CARD9). In summary, the association of the DARC Asp42Gly variant with MCP-1 levels replicates previous GWA results substantiating a potential role for DARC in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.	 18621010 3435047 19092169 8651310 20514049 17073738 20368224 18492752 18848781 10201015 20936118 10961863 10807766 17187069 22291609 20017911 17955335 14679177 9949321 10791881 20040767 12594297 16691291 16322393 17611196 16091493 9545414 17903293 16306344 22473371 16341265 20061440 16960181 20595521
23007406	Genome-wide association study identifies germline polymorphisms associated with relapse of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	With the use of risk-directed therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), outcome has improved dramatically in the past 40 years. However, a substantial portion of patients, many of whom have no known risk factors, experience relapse. Taking a genome-wide approach, in the present study, we evaluated the relationships between genotypes at 444 044 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of relapse in 2535 children with newly diagnosed ALL after adjusting for genetic ancestry and treatment regimen. We identified 134 SNPs that were reproducibly associated with ALL relapse. Of 134 relapse SNPs, 133 remained prognostic after adjusting for all known relapse risk factors, including minimal residual disease, and 111 were significant even among patients who were negative for minimal residual disease after remission induction therapy. The C allele at rs7142143 in the PYGL gene was associated with 3.6-fold higher risk of relapse than the T allele (P = 6.7 × 10(-9)). Fourteen of the 134 relapse SNPs, including variants in PDE4B and ABCB1, were also associated with antileukemic drug pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics. In the present study, we systematically identified host genetic variations related to treatment outcome of childhood ALL, most of which were prognostic independent of known risk factors for relapse, and some of which also influenced outcome by affecting host dis-position of antileukemic drugs.

23006423	Genetic association with overall survival of taxane-treated lung cancer patients - a genome-wide association study in human lymphoblastoid cell lines followed by a clinical association study.	Taxane is one of the first line treatments of lung cancer. In order to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might contribute to taxane response, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for two taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, using 276 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), followed by genotyping of top candidate SNPs in 874 lung cancer patient samples treated with paclitaxel.	 15789306 20177059 17186465 16575015 19889969 16950614 19470925 12867068 15942666 18068131 18414050 15277258 18364242 16949365 19896968 19712457 20583997 20101151 17233588 21109222 19224581 18757419 17686970 12897244 20000738 7682915 15161987 20132241 7885406 21945524 17092739 19576174 16293411 18593940 18504338 15161985 20200426 15828850 19043577 20923822 20172487 20047843 20632219 20212519 19898621 15282376
23049750	Haplotypes with copy number and single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2A6 locus are associated with smoking quantity in a Japanese population.	Smoking is a major public health problem, but the genetic factors associated with smoking behaviors are not fully elucidated. Here, we have conducted an integrated genome-wide association study to identify common copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) in Japanese smokers (N = 17,158). Our analysis identified a common CNP with a strong effect on CPD (rs8102683; P=3.8 x 10(-42)) in the 19q13 region, encompassing the CYP2A6 locus. After adjustment for the associated CNP, we found an additional associated SNP (rs11878604; P=9.7 x 10(-30)) located 30 kb downstream of the CYP2A6 gene. Imputation of the CYP2A6 locus revealed that haplotypes underlying the CNP and the SNP corresponded to classical, functional alleles of CYP2A6 gene that regulate nicotine metabolism and explained 2% of the phenotypic variance of CPD (ANOVA F-test P=9.5 x 10(-52)). These haplotypes were also associated with smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arteriosclerosis obliterans.	 20418890 21738478 15475735 11315092 16778047 17511519 16862161 17982410 19810025 18776912 17943122 21659447 16192683 19214210 10857244 20644199 14566096 22125222 20418888 15861035 19812545 19200528 12492752 21854229 18817904 20976247 19812666 19541866 20418889 18776909 20555335 17247344 20360734 18691683 15308589
23001564	Genome-wide meta-analysis points to CTC1 and ZNF676 as genes regulating telomere homeostasis in humans.	Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with a number of common age-related diseases and is a heritable trait. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified two loci on chromosomes 3q26.2 (TERC) and 10q24.33 (OBFC1) that are associated with the inter-individual LTL variation. We performed a meta-analysis of 9190 individuals from six independent GWAS and validated our findings in 2226 individuals from four additional studies. We confirmed previously reported associations with OBFC1 (rs9419958 P = 9.1 × 10(-11)) and with the telomerase RNA component TERC (rs1317082, P = 1.1 × 10(-8)). We also identified two novel genomic regions associated with LTL variation that map near a conserved telomere maintenance complex component 1 (CTC1; rs3027234, P = 3.6 × 10(-8)) on chromosome17p13.1 and zinc finger protein 676 (ZNF676; rs412658, P = 3.3 × 10(-8)) on 19p12. The minor allele of rs3027234 was associated with both shorter LTL and lower expression of CTC1. Our findings are consistent with the recent observations that point mutations in CTC1 cause short telomeres in both Arabidopsis and humans affected by a rare Mendelian syndrome. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the genetic architecture of inter-individual LTL variation in the general population.	 18268147 2023635 11315092 14732735 18974171 22267198 17934056 22180315 10835362 20139977 17246646 17384015 22237065 22253318 18388332 21289018 20855079 16785237 19216021 14975611 19135888 20007561 22037553 16112303 12665246 20697207 14639702 19359265 16205635 19578363 20616382 16532393 17392301 20832719 20543847 19898481 21441540 19246701 18776218 11170401 18680434 21085125 18270372 18462274 8651220 19557189 18411343 17223473 8275211 11731797 20138964 22136229 1208363 21058334 17460043 19151717 21304890 17925004 21600224 19854130 16445281 17701901 21993562 20421499 21167468 10964005 20192761 21436073 19648609 19543373 1669507 20600576 21045058 11889014 21743467
23022100	Discovery and fine mapping of serum protein loci through transethnic meta-analysis.	Many disorders are associated with altered serum protein concentrations, including malnutrition, cancer, and cardiovascular, kidney, and inflammatory diseases. Although these protein concentrations are highly heritable, relatively little is known about their underlying genetic determinants. Through transethnic meta-analysis of European-ancestry and Japanese genome-wide association studies, we identified six loci at genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) for serum albumin (HPN-SCN1B, GCKR-FNDC4, SERPINF2-WDR81, TNFRSF11A-ZCCHC2, FRMD5-WDR76, and RPS11-FCGRT, in up to 53,190 European-ancestry and 9,380 Japanese individuals) and three loci for total protein (TNFRS13B, 6q21.3, and ELL2, in up to 25,539 European-ancestry and 10,168 Japanese individuals). We observed little evidence of heterogeneity in allelic effects at these loci between groups of European and Japanese ancestry but obtained substantial improvements in the resolution of fine mapping of potential causal variants by leveraging transethnic differences in the distribution of linkage disequilibrium. We demonstrated a functional role for the most strongly associated serum albumin locus, HPN, for which Hpn knockout mice manifest low plasma albumin concentrations. Other loci associated with serum albumin harbor genes related to ribosome function, protein translation, and proteasomal degradation, whereas those associated with serum total protein include genes related to immune function. Our results highlight the advantages of transethnic meta-analysis for the discovery and fine mapping of complex trait loci and have provided initial insights into the underlying genetic architecture of serum protein concentrations and their association with human disease.	 10707915 11257270 11315092 12566415 12646614 6684863 6541017 3569874 9250267 9435303 16549777 17943122 18385676 19474294 19763151 20139978 20418888 20418890 20714348 20981092 21167468 21829388 21909109 22125221

23023329	Genome-wide association study in Chinese men identifies two new prostate cancer risk loci at 9q31.2 and 19q13.4.	Prostate cancer risk-associated variants have been reported in populations of European descent, African-Americans and Japanese using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To systematically investigate prostate cancer risk-associated variants in Chinese men, we performed the first GWAS in Han Chinese. In addition to confirming several associations reported in other ancestry groups, this study identified two new risk-associated loci for prostate cancer on chromosomes 9q31.2 (rs817826, P = 5.45 × 10(-14)) and 19q13.4 (rs103294, P = 5.34 × 10(-16)) in 4,484 prostate cancer cases and 8,934 controls. The rs103294 marker at 19q13.4 is in strong linkage equilibrium with a 6.7-kb germline deletion that removes the first six of seven exons in LILRA3, a gene regulating inflammatory response, and was significantly associated with the mRNA expression of LILRA3 in T cells (P < 1 × 10(-4)). These findings may advance the understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.	 9548455 22366784 16682969 17384581 17401363 17401366 17603485 17194218 17701901 18199855 18264096 18264097 18264098 18439545 19169255 19219042 19644074 19767753 11169408 19767754 19767755 20676098 20634204 20702402 21304890 21296855 21602798 21743467 21756274 22114074 16501917
22961000	Dense fine-mapping study identifies new susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis.	We genotyped 2,861 cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) from the UK PBC Consortium and 8,514 UK population controls across 196,524 variants within 186 known autoimmune risk loci. We identified 3 loci newly associated with PBC (at P<5×10(-8)), increasing the number of known susceptibility loci to 25. The most associated variant at 19p12 is a low-frequency nonsynonymous SNP in TYK2, further implicating JAK-STAT and cytokine signaling in disease pathogenesis. An additional five loci contained nonsynonymous variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2>0.8) with the most associated variant at the locus. We found multiple independent common, low-frequency and rare variant association signals at five loci. Of the 26 independent non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) signals tagged on the Immunochip, 15 have SNPs in B-lymphoblastoid open chromatin regions in high LD (r2>0.8) with the most associated variant. This study shows how data from dense fine-mapping arrays coupled with functional genomic data can be used to identify candidate causal variants for functional follow-up.	 11315092 16177252 12144621 10190721 10421645 15713222 16862161 16941709 17846035 18179884 18311140 18653518 19003916 19092835 19302244 19458352 19543373 19293837 19966805 20453842 20560212 20507892 20639880 19430480 20953190 20729906 21102463 21354972 21399635 21300701 21526222 21374718 21750106 21345260 22057235 22500001 22293038 17701901 11719900
23031429	A genome-wide association study of monozygotic twin-pairs suggests a locus related to variability of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.	Genome-wide association analysis on monozygotic twin-pairs offers a route to discovery of gene environment interactions through testing for variability loci associated with sensitivity to individual environment/lifestyle. We present a genome-wide scan of loci associated with intra-pair differences in serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels. We report data for 1,720 monozygotic female twin-pairs from GenomEUtwin project with 2.5 million SNPs, imputed or genotyped, and measured serum lipid fractions for both twins. We found one locus associated with intra-pair differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, rs2483058 in an intron of SRGAP2, where twins carrying the C allele are more sensitive to environmental factors(P=3.98 x 10-8). We followed up the association in further genotyped monozygotic twins (N= 1,261),which showed a moderate association for the variant (P= 0.200, same direction of an effect). In addition,we report a new association on the level of apolipoprotein A-ll (P= 4.03 x 1 o-8).	 11931686 22241830 48701 6936104 9199573 9508003 13751193 16369550 16355405 16611487 16934002 17572673 17708702 18193043 18193044 18193046 17549066 19060911 19543373 20686565 20428936 22028671 14624719

23053960	Genome-wide pathway analysis of genome-wide association studies on systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.	The aim of this study was to explore candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and candidate mechanisms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two SLE genome-wide association studies (GWASs) datasets were included in this study. Meta-analysis was conducted using 737,984 SNPs in 1,527 SLE cases and 3,421 controls of European ancestry, and 4,429 SNPs that met a threshold of p < 0.01 in a Korean RA GWAS dataset was used. ICSNPathway (identify candidate causal SNPs and pathways) analysis was applied to the meta-analysis results of the SLE GWAS datasets, and a RA GWAS dataset. The most significant result of SLE GWAS meta-analysis concerned rs2051549 in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (p = 3.36E-22). In the non-HLA region, meta-analysis identified 6 SNPs associated with SLE with genome-wide significance (STAT4, TNPO3, BLK, FAM167A, and IRF5). ICSNPathway identified five candidate causal SNPs and 13 candidate causal pathways. This pathway-based analysis provides three hypotheses of the biological mechanism involved. First, rs8084 and rs7192 → HLA-DRA → bystander B cell activation. Second, rs1800629 → TNF → cytokine network. Third, rs1150752 and rs185819 → TNXB → collagen metabolic process. ICSNPathway analysis identified three candidate causal non-HLA SNPs and four candidate causal pathways involving the PADI4, MTR, PADI2, and TPH2 genes of RA. We identified five candidate SNPs and thirteen pathways, involving bystander B cell activation, cytokine network, and collagen metabolic processing, which may contribute to SLE susceptibility, and we revealed candidate causal non-HLA SNPs, genes, and pathways of RA.	 19225526 18204098 18974171 12111919 21085203 19079261 22129255 2271017 19502269 19408013 3802833 17966091 16418737 21437164 19479340 9432252 16208513 21622953 19161620 19043711 21452313 16320344 18204446 9310563 19235186 19880382 10802651
23056639	A genome-wide association study of circulating galectin-3.	Galectin-3 is a lectin involved in fibrosis, inflammation and proliferation. Increased circulating levels of galectin-3 have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, immunological disorders, and cardiovascular disease. To enhance our knowledge on galectin-3 biology we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 array imputed with the HapMap 2 CEU panel on plasma galectin-3 levels in 3,776 subjects and follow-up genotyping in an additional 3,516 subjects. We identified 2 genome wide significant loci associated with plasma galectin-3 levels. One locus harbours the LGALS3 gene (rs2274273; P = 2.35 × 10(-188)) and the other locus the ABO gene (rs644234; P = 3.65 × 10(-47)). The variance explained by the LGALS3 locus was 25.6% and by the ABO locus 3.8% and jointly they explained 29.2%. Rs2274273 lies in high linkage disequilibrium with two non-synonymous SNPs (rs4644; r(2) = 1.0, and rs4652; r(2) = 0.91) and wet lab follow-up genotyping revealed that both are strongly associated with galectin-3 levels (rs4644; P = 4.97 × 10(-465) and rs4652 P = 1.50 × 10(-421)) and were also associated with LGALS3 gene-expression. The origins of our associations should be further validated by means of functional experiments.	 11004219 22026577 15213811 15375548 8193150 9191041 9439577 16478649 17497244 17635792 17701901 17350328 18549522 19200528 19219041 19064001 19474294 19594635 19648160 20080851 20153309 20425490 21189092 21355061 21829388 21974805 22674139 12223271
23043469	HbA2 levels in normal adults are influenced by two distinct genetic mechanisms.	Using a genome-wide association study, we found that common inter-individual differences in haemoglobin A(2)  (HbA(2) , α(2) δ(2) ) levels are largely governed by genetic factors (42% of variability). The influence of age (1%) and sex (4%) was small. HbA(2)  levels were influenced by two loci: the HBS1L-MYB locus on chromosome 6q, which has been shown to have pleiotropic effects on other haematological traits; and a second locus surrounding HBB, the gene encoding β-globin. Our results suggest that HbA(2)  levels in adults are influenced by two different biological processes: one via kinetics of erythropoiesis, and the other, via competition between HBB and HBD activity.	
23049088	A genome-wide association study provides evidence for association of chromosome 8p23 (MYP10) and 10q21.1 (MYP15) with high myopia in the French Population.	Myopia is a complex trait affected by both genetic and environmental factors. High myopia is associated with increased risk of sight threatening eye disorders such as retinal detachment. The purpose of this genome-wide association study was to identify susceptibility genes contributing to high myopia in the French population.	
23064961	GWAS of dental caries patterns in the permanent dentition.	The importance of susceptibility genes in the risk for dental caries has been clearly established. While many candidate caries genes have been proposed, to date, few of them have been rigorously validated through observational and experimental studies. Moreover, most genetic epidemiological studies have analyzed global caries phenotypes that ignore the possibility that genes may exert differential effects across tooth surfaces of the dentition. Therefore, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 5 novel dental caries phenotypes (developed by clustering the permanent dentition into categories of tooth surfaces based on co-occurrence of caries) to nominate new candidate caries genes. GWAS was performed in 920 self-reported white participants, aged 18 to 75 years, with genotype data on 518,997 genetic variants. We identified a significant genetic association between dental caries of the anterior mandibular teeth and LYZL2 (p value = 9e-9), which codes a bacteriolytic agent thought to be involved in host defense. We also identified a significant genetic association between caries of the mid- dentition tooth surfaces and AJAP1 (p value = 2e-8), a gene possibly involved in tooth development. Suggestive genetic associations were also observed for ABCG2, PKD2, the dentin/bone SCPP sub-family, EDNRA, TJFBR1, NKX2-3, IFT88, TWSG1, IL17D, and SMAD7 (p values < 7e-6). We nominate these novel genes for future study.	 22405185 18502959 18522740 19211681 19389368 21940522 23064960 23106439 16121123 12653249 17684756 17916067 19252934 19659474 22156348 16762015 12141427 17499880 16289463 21073982 15306564 16014814 3165997 17701901 17267690 19462458 14732975 18978678 19578371
23065704	A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to identify prostate cancer susceptibility loci associated with aggressive and non-aggressive disease.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common genetic variants associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PrCa), but these explain less than one-third of the heritability. To identify further susceptibility alleles, we conducted a meta-analysis of four GWAS including 5953 cases of aggressive PrCa and 11 463 controls (men without PrCa). We computed association tests for approximately 2.6 million SNPs and followed up the most significant SNPs by genotyping 49 121 samples in 29 studies through the international PRACTICAL and BPC3 consortia. We not only confirmed the association of a PrCa susceptibility locus, rs11672691 on chromosome 19, but also showed an association with aggressive PrCa [odds ratio = 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.21), P = 1.4 × 10(-8)]. This report describes a genetic variant which is associated with aggressive PrCa, which is a type of PrCa associated with a poorer prognosis.	 19318570 17572673 18073375 19470757 19767755 19956106 20233392 20881960 21467234 21846818 21743057 10202129 16921508 17201906 17384015 12563560 18264097
23093944	Mining the unknown: a systems approach to metabolite identification combining genetic and metabolic information.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with metabolomics data linked genetic variation in the human genome to differences in individual metabolite levels. A strong relevance of this metabolic individuality for biomedical and pharmaceutical research has been reported. However, a considerable amount of the molecules currently quantified by modern metabolomics techniques are chemically unidentified. The identification of these "unknown metabolites" is still a demanding and intricate task, limiting their usability as functional markers of metabolic processes. As a consequence, previous GWAS largely ignored unknown metabolites as metabolic traits for the analysis. Here we present a systems-level approach that combines genome-wide association analysis and Gaussian graphical modeling with metabolomics to predict the identity of the unknown metabolites. We apply our method to original data of 517 metabolic traits, of which 225 are unknowns, and genotyping information on 655,658 genetic variants, measured in 1,768 human blood samples. We report previously undescribed genotype-metabotype associations for six distinct gene loci (SLC22A2, COMT, CYP3A5, CYP2C18, GBA3, UGT3A1) and one locus not related to any known gene (rs12413935). Overlaying the inferred genetic associations, metabolic networks, and knowledge-based pathway information, we derive testable hypotheses on the biochemical identities of 106 unknown metabolites. As a proof of principle, we experimentally confirm nine concrete predictions. We demonstrate the benefit of our method for the functional interpretation of previous metabolomics biomarker studies on liver detoxification, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Our approach is generic in nature and can be directly transferred to metabolomics data from different experimental platforms.	 18650507 17882155 18953024 19015140 19176550 19300499 19369366 19414484 19419973 19797678 20037589 20383145 20383146 20101071 20526369 20623627 20452782 20811451 20066004 21170321 21045058 21182243 21281499 21533175 21572414 21646302 21827274 21852955 21886157 21931564 21928819 22085899 22511988 10581325 10592173 10802651 14668810 14757781 7129800 2868390 1588921 8723741 16032513 17267599 17389044 17701901 19043545
23092984	Genome-wide association of mood-incongruent psychotic bipolar disorder.	Mood-incongruent psychotic features (MICP) are familial symptoms of bipolar disorder (BP) that also occur in schizophrenia (SZ), and may represent manifestations of shared etiology between the major psychoses. In this study we have analyzed three large samples of BP with imputed genome-wide association data and have performed a meta-analysis of 2196 cases with MICP and 8148 controls. We found several regions with suggestive evidence of association (P<10(-6)), although no marker met genome-wide significance criteria. The top associations were on chromosomes: 6q14.2 within the PRSS35/SNAP91 gene complex (rs1171113, P=9.67 × 10(-8)); 3p22.2 downstream of TRANK/LBA1 (rs9834970, P=9.71 × 10(-8)); and 14q24.2 in an intron of NUMB (rs2333194, P=7.03 × 10(-7)). These associations were present in all three samples, and both rs1171113 and rs2333194 were found to be overrepresented in an analysis of MICP cases compared with all other BP cases. To test the relationship of MICP with SZ, we performed polygenic analysis using the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium SZ results and found evidence of association between SZ polygenes and the presence of MICP in BP cases (meta-analysis P=0.003). In summary, our analysis of the MICP phenotype in BP has provided suggestive evidence for association of common variants in several genes expressed in the nervous system. The results of our polygenic analysis provides support for a modest degree of genetic overlap between BP with MICP and SZ, highlighting that phenotypic correlations across syndromes may be due to the influence of polygenic risk factors.	 655775 11315512 21972277 9585807 11779129 20636636 6622995 8250681 20516154 11059995 20403315 15465978 21926972 12167516 1415828 1883262 17267786 22182935 21353194 10531053 22230881 15236660 1443243 18235861 19689503 16099039 18539534 21296491 11977118 3976922 19571811 16806881 8841677 19488044 21676994
23103227	Genetic variants at 6p21.1 and 7p15.3 are associated with risk of multiple cancers in Han Chinese.	Cancer susceptibility loci identified in reported genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often tumor-specific; however, evidence of pleiotropy of some genes/loci has also been observed and biologically plausible. We hypothesized that there are important regions in the genome harboring genetic variants associated with risk of multiple types of cancer. In the current study, we attempted to map genetic variants that have consistent effects on risk of multiple cancers using our existing genome-wide scan data of lung cancer, noncardia gastric cancer, and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma with overall 5,368 cases and 4,006 controls (GWAS stage), followed by a further evaluation in additional 9,001 cases with one of these cancer types and 11,436 controls (replication stage). Five variants satisfying the criteria of pleiotropy with p values from 1.10 × 10(-8) to 8.96 × 10(-6) for genome-wide scans of three cancer types were further evaluated in the replication stage. We found consistent associations of rs2494938 at 6p21.1 and rs2285947 at 7p15.3 with these three cancers in both GWAS and replication stages. In combined samples of GWAS and replication stages, the minor alleles of rs2494938 and rs2285947 were significantly associated with an increased risk of the cancers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.19 and OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.12-1.21), with the p values being 1.20 × 10(-12) and 1.26 × 10(-16), respectively, which are at a genome-wide significance level. Our findings highlight the potential importance of variants at 6p21.1 and 7p15.3 in the susceptibility to multiple cancers.	 17529967 21639937 17618283 17618284 17481747 17701901 18077673 18577746 18293090 18978787 18978790 19151717 19561604 19561607 19578363 19578364 19578366 19578367 11165392 15375157 7914033 7997261 16495444 16531999 16585162 16682969 17401363 17401364 17401366 17463249 17554300 17478679 17577922 19767752 19767754 19767755 19838192 20101243 20453838 20512145 20626350 20634204 20956613 21330928 21642993 21678065 21725308 21925124 22037551 22037553 17618282
23104006	Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies new endometriosis risk loci.	We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4,604 endometriosis cases and 9,393 controls of Japanese and European ancestry. We show that rs12700667 on chromosome 7p15.2, previously found to associate with disease in Europeans, replicates in Japanese (P = 3.6 × 10(-3)), and we confirm association of rs7521902 at 1p36.12 near WNT4. In addition, we establish an association of rs13394619 in GREB1 at 2p25.1 with endometriosis and identify a newly associated locus at 12q22 near VEZT (rs10859871). Excluding cases of European ancestry of minimal or unknown severity, we identified additional previously unknown loci at 2p14 (rs4141819), 6p22.3 (rs7739264) and 9p21.3 (rs1537377). All seven SNP effects were replicated in an independent cohort and associated at P <5 × 10(-8) in a combined analysis. Finally, we found a significant overlap in polygenic risk for endometriosis between the genome-wide association cohorts of European and Japanese descent (P = 8.8 × 10(-11)), indicating that many weakly associated SNPs represent true endometriosis risk loci and that risk prediction and future targeted disease therapy may be transferred across these populations.	 17056043 16862161 17701901 17786212 18300295 18535005 19571811 19715440 19896111 20509871 20598278 20601957 20371632 20616382 21058334 20056765 20844546 21151130 21156161 21565292 21407268 22243964 22606288 11078826 12402310 3802833 9130884 9989404 10202882 15986123 16080113 17194218
23104005	A study based on whole-genome sequencing yields a rare variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer.	In Western countries, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer of men and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Several genome-wide association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders. We identified a new low-frequency variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in European populations, rs188140481[A] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.90; P(combined) = 6.2 × 10(-34)), with an average risk allele frequency in controls of 0.54%. This variant is only very weakly correlated (r(2) ≤ 0.06) with previously reported risk variants at 8q24, and its association remains significant after adjustment for all known risk-associated variants. Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059). We also report results for a previously described HOXB13 variant (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as a prostate cancer risk variant in populations from across Europe.	 10891514 22267200 16682969 17012270 17401363 17401364 17401366 17460686 17572673 17529967 17603485 17618282 17618283 17618284 17925536 18794855 19165921 19767752 19767754 19767755 20062064 20981099 21946351 21964575 21983786 22236224 15630470
23108145	Genome-wide association study reveals novel genetic determinants of DNA repair capacity in lung cancer.	Suboptimal cellular DNA repair capacity (DRC) has been shown to be associated with enhanced cancer risk, but genetic variants affecting the DRC phenotype have not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, with the available DRC phenotype data, we analyzed correlations between the DRC phenotype and genotypes detected by the Illumina 317K platform in 1,774 individuals of European ancestry from a Texas lung cancer genome-wide association study. The discovery phase was followed by a replication in an independent set of 1,374 cases and controls of European ancestry. We applied a generalized linear model with single nucleotide polymorphisms as predictors and DRC (a continuous variable) as the outcome. Covariates of age, sex, pack-years of smoking, DRC assay-related variables, and case-control status of the study participants were adjusted in the model. We validated that reduced DRC was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in both independent datasets. Several suggestive loci that contributed to the DRC phenotype were defined in ERCC2/XPD, PHACTR2, and DUSP1. In summary, we determined that DRC is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, and we defined several genetic loci contributing to DRC phenotype.	 15090466 15489140 7001511 6304528 3155495 3826460 1390626 1406996 1844821 8221888 8705998 8797573 8825469 8879589 9115419 9433641 9485007 9683183 15584438 15297300 15657342 16023682 17183062 17341660 15256476 17701901 17494053 17975167 18385676 18544745 18566018 19429005 20068090 20651612 11058619 11245433 11245449 11872635 11900249 12045153 12427537 12619034 12925960 15107502 20478396 21178723 21167019 21106707 22237781 22677538
23108985	Suggestion of GLYAT gene underlying variation of bone size and body lean mass as revealed by a bivariate genome-wide association study.	Bone and muscle, two major tissue types of musculoskeletal system, have strong genetic determination. Abnormality in bone and/or muscle may cause musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Bone size phenotypes (BSPs), such as hip bone size (HBS), appendicular bone size (ABS), are genetically correlated with body lean mass (mainly muscle mass). However, the specific genes shared by these phenotypes are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify the specific genes with pleiotropic effects on BSPs and appendicular lean mass (ALM). We performed a bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) by analyzing ~690,000 SNPs in 1,627 unrelated Han Chinese adults (802 males and 825 females) followed by a replication study in 2,286 unrelated US Caucasians (558 males and 1,728 females). We identified 14 interesting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may contribute to variation of both BSPs and ALM, with p values <10(-6) in discovery stage. Among them, the association of three SNPs (rs2507838, rs7116722, and rs11826261) in/near GLYAT (glycine-N-acyltransferase) gene was replicated in US Caucasians, with p values ranging from 1.89 × 10(-3) to 3.71 × 10(-4) for ALM-ABS, from 5.14 × 10(-3) to 1.11 × 10(-2) for ALM-HBS, respectively. Meta-analyses yielded stronger association signals for rs2507838, rs7116722, and rs11826261, with pooled p values of 1.68 × 10(-8), 7.94 × 10(-8), 6.80 × 10(-8) for ALB-ABS and 1.22 × 10(-4), 9.85 × 10(-5), 3.96 × 10(-4) for ALM-HBS, respectively. Haplotype allele ATA based on these three SNPs was also associated with ALM-HBS and ALM-ABS in both discovery and replication samples. Interestingly, GLYAT was previously found to be essential to glucose metabolism and energy metabolism, suggesting the gene's dual role in both bone development and muscle growth. Our findings, together with the prior biological evidence, suggest the importance of GLYAT gene in co-regulation of bone phenotypes and body lean mass.	 22023899 19714249 12878739 17711062 19390609 16862161 11165939 21856995 17658951 12036807 16478798 17550956 12145010 15615073 15758500 20925583 17952575 17299116 21529326 12663124 18520697 19063671 19268274 11940728 18580690 2375286 19324521 15824844 18501122 21370710 15297300 12434164 11127195 18245381 21199696 21732232 19489754 21947420 4370876 15758435 21718263 11486029 18924135 20379172 17701901 18776929 19252341 19652719 22087292
23118916	Genome-wide scan identifies variant in TNFSF13 associated with serum IgM in a healthy Chinese male population.	IgM provides a first line of defense during microbial infections. Serum IgM levels are detected routinely in clinical practice. And IgM is a genetically complex trait. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants affecting serum IgM levels in a Chinese population of 3495, including 1999 unrelated subjects in the first stage and 1496 independent individuals in the second stage. Our data show that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11552708 located in the TNFSF13 gene was significantly associated with IgM levels (p = 5.00×10(-7) in first stage, p = 1.34×10(-3) in second stage, and p = 4.22×10(-9) when combined). Besides, smoking was identified to be associated with IgM levels in both stages (P<0.05), but there was no significant interaction between smoking and the identified SNP (P>0.05). It is suggested that TNFSF13 may be a susceptibility gene affecting serum IgM levels in Chinese male population.	 10051627 9743536 10398604 10413651 15630136 16007087 16412052 16862161 17570691 10630136 10880535 10898980 11021805 11104810 10973284 11286694 17572673 17569747 17701901 18254984 19210517 20945608 20948548 21353261 22262757 22297166 22171074 22136669 22558069 11571266 12070306 12730512 14988498 4188215 4038983 1382992 8565555 10359578
23118974	Genome-wide association studies of quantitatively measured skin, hair, and eye pigmentation in four European populations.	Pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes varies both within and between human populations. Identifying the genes and alleles underlying this variation has been the goal of many candidate gene and several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most GWAS for pigmentary traits to date have been based on subjective phenotypes using categorical scales. But skin, hair, and eye pigmentation vary continuously. Here, we seek to characterize quantitative variation in these traits objectively and accurately and to determine their genetic basis. Objective and quantitative measures of skin, hair, and eye color were made using reflectance or digital spectroscopy in Europeans from Ireland, Poland, Italy, and Portugal. A GWAS was conducted for the three quantitative pigmentation phenotypes in 176 women across 313,763 SNP loci, and replication of the most significant associations was attempted in a sample of 294 European men and women from the same countries. We find that the pigmentation phenotypes are highly stratified along axes of European genetic differentiation. The country of sampling explains approximately 35% of the variation in skin pigmentation, 31% of the variation in hair pigmentation, and 40% of the variation in eye pigmentation. All three quantitative phenotypes are correlated with each other. In our two-stage association study, we reproduce the association of rs1667394 at the OCA2/HERC2 locus with eye color but we do not identify new genetic determinants of skin and hair pigmentation supporting the lack of major genes affecting skin and hair color variation within Europe and suggesting that not only careful phenotyping but also larger cohorts are required to understand the genetic architecture of these complex quantitative traits. Interestingly, we also see that in each of these four populations, men are more lightly pigmented in the unexposed skin of the inner arm than women, a fact that is underappreciated and may vary across the world.	 11511307 10896812 12499305 12579416 12817591 14709592 9597799 15297300 15714523 15726415 16041375 16357253 16374866 16685728 17182896 17554300 17194218 17701901 17619204 17999355 17952075 18046745 18208327 18208329 18252221 18252222 18172690 18483556 18488028 18758442 18650849 19307593 19384953 19619260 19715440 19656326 19710684 20445093 20463881 20585627 20546537 21058334 21197618 21749400 21813346 20616560 10766940 11754475
23118302	Genome-wide association study evaluating lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 mass and activity at baseline and after rosuvastatin therapy.	Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) is a proinflammatory enzyme bound to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other circulating lipoproteins. Two measures of Lp-PLA(2), mass and activity, are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Data are sparse regarding genetic determinants of Lp-PLA(2) mass and activity, and no prior data are available addressing genetic determinants of statin-induced changes for this proinflammatory biomarker.	
23128233	Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease.	Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people of European ancestry, with rising prevalence in other populations. Genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses of these two diseases as separate phenotypes have implicated previously unsuspected mechanisms, such as autophagy, in their pathogenesis and showed that some IBD loci are shared with other inflammatory diseases. Here we expand on the knowledge of relevant pathways by undertaking a meta-analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis genome-wide association scans, followed by extensive validation of significant findings, with a combined total of more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci, that meet genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to both phenotypes, and both directional (consistently favouring one allele over the course of human history) and balancing (favouring the retention of both alleles within populations) selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.	 20463879 19474294 21283567 21297633 22029983 22223662 21345260 19864672 18344981 20004777 18462017 17432931 18836448 18344982 21102463 19557189 17881745 22236433 20934598 22019778 16646834 18326015 21602305 22001864 16229232 20211141 21878628 21677747 21963258 17676033

23818313	Combined linkage and association analyses identify a novel locus for obesity near PROX1 in Asians.	Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have substantially contributed to understanding the genetic architecture, unidentified variants for complex traits remain an issue. One of the efficient approaches is the improvement of the power of GWAS scan by weighting P values with prior linkage signals. Our objective was to identify the novel candidates for obesity in Asian populations by using genemapping strategies that combine linkage and association analyses.	
23142968	Whole-genome-wide association study in the Bulgarian population reveals HHAT as schizophrenia susceptibility gene.	Schizophrenia, the most common major psychiatric disorder (or group of disorders), entails severe decline of higher functions, principally with alterations in cognitive functioning and reality perception. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in its pathogenesis; however, its genetic background still needs to be clarified. The objective of the study was to reveal genetic markers associated with schizophrenia in the Bulgarian population.	
23144319	Prognostic implications of genetic variants in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a genome-wide association study.	The prognostic significance of inherited genetic variants in advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remains unknown. In this study, we genotyped 271 817 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 348 advanced NSCLC patients who received chemotherapy and analyzed their association with prognosis by using Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted for known prognostic factors. Top candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected using the bootstrap re-sampling procedure. Median age of patient population was 56 years. Proportions of female, never smokers and adenocarcinoma were 64.9, 67.5 and 80.4%, respectively. We identified 17 top candidate SNPs related to prognosis using cut-off minimum P value of <5.0 × 10(-5) in at least 70% of 1000 bootstrap samples. These SNPs were located in the genomic regions of the FAM154A, ANKS1A, DLST, THSD7B, NCOA2, CDH8, SLC35D2, NALCN and EGF genes. The most significant SNP, rs1571228 (9p22.1:FAM154A), was significantly associated with overall survival in dominant model [AG+GG to AA, hazard ratio (HR) of death (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.42-0.67); P = 2.025 × 10(-7)]. The SNP at 4q25:EGF, rs11098063, for which some genetic variations was previously reported to be associated with prognosis, also showed significant association with overall survival in additive model [CC versus CT versus TT, HR (95% CI) = 1.00 versus 0.61 (0.47-0.78) versus 0.39 (0.19-0.79); P = 9.582 × 10(-6)]. Survival differences according to the genotype of these SNPs were independent of sex, smoking, histology and chemotherapy regimens. These results suggested the variants at multiple genetic loci might contribute to the risk of death in advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy.	
23139255	Novel loci associated with PR interval in a genome-wide association study of 10 African American cohorts.	The PR interval, as measured by the resting, standard 12-lead ECG, reflects the duration of atrial/atrioventricular nodal depolarization. Substantial evidence exists for a genetic contribution to PR, including genome-wide association studies that have identified common genetic variants at 9 loci influencing PR in populations of European and Asian descent. However, few studies have examined loci associated with PR in African Americans.	 16430945 16773560 17967977 18436145 18852200 19102036 19305408 19305409 19213946 19389651 19549974 19478819 20062060 20062061 20062063 20040588 20220756 20502693 20479155 20400780 20412120 20616382 7188949 1576220 10231028 10471492 21041692 21076409 21044898 21347284 21325150 21738479 22544366 10835412 11234013 11315092 11495938 11593451 11839626 12734009 15313941 15459662

23143601	Genome-wide association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci in never-smoking women in Asia.	To identify common genetic variants that contribute to lung cancer susceptibility, we conducted a multistage genome-wide association study of lung cancer in Asian women who never smoked. We scanned 5,510 never-smoking female lung cancer cases and 4,544 controls drawn from 14 studies from mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. We genotyped the most promising variants (associated at P < 5 × 10(-6)) in an additional 1,099 cases and 2,913 controls. We identified three new susceptibility loci at 10q25.2 (rs7086803, P = 3.54 × 10(-18)), 6q22.2 (rs9387478, P = 4.14 × 10(-10)) and 6p21.32 (rs2395185, P = 9.51 × 10(-9)). We also confirmed associations reported for loci at 5p15.33 and 3q28 and a recently reported finding at 17q24.3. We observed no evidence of association for lung cancer at 15q25 in never-smoking women in Asia, providing strong evidence that this locus is not associated with lung cancer independent of smoking.	 18852200 22729933 18978787 18978790 18778756 19122664 18788891 19491260 19543373 19648918 19755391 19755392 19836008 19837788 20602996 20548021 20700438 20871597 20855837 21262811 21559498 21725308 21892161 22140546 22200770 22243751 22286212 22327623 22215748 22323360 22585858 22464348 22367405 11973641 12048270 15342541 15514239 2824385 16131485 16862161 17060358 17234637 17213806 17194218 17882278 18083107 18314483 18385720 18385738 18385676 18424891 22797724 22797725 18957677
23143602	Common genetic variants in the CLDN2 and PRSS1-PRSS2 loci alter risk for alcohol-related and sporadic pancreatitis.	Pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory disorder. Alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. We now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at PRSS1-PRSS2 (P < 1 × 10(-12)) and X-linked CLDN2 (P < 1 × 10(-21)) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). The PRSS1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. The CLDN2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. The homozygous (or hemizygous in males) CLDN2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk. These results could partially explain the high frequency of alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26, whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07).	 21460841 18063422 18974171 5432063 16862161 17446836 17466744 2381902 21876681 19939292 14751232 17549761 22572128 18765957 18198187 388439 18609130 19506173 16415888 22614753 21771795 19214581 8841182 16699518 21206985 22268650 11934881 12432083 16328347 10801388 17701901 20981092 21167468 19581740 21875495 17608765 6706066 19453252 20125091 10982753 6266278 4784706 11179244

23151678	Impact of four loci on serum tamsulosin hydrochloride concentration.	Tamsulosin hydrochloride is one of the most potent drugs for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), however, the efficacy of tamsulosin hydrochloride varies among individuals. In this study, we measured the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of tamsulosin hydrochloride in 182 of BPH patients and found remarkable individual variability. To investigate the genetic factors that regulate pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride, we conducted a genome-wide association study in these 182 BPH patients. As a result, rs16902947 on chromosome 5p13.2, rs7779057 on 7q22.3, rs35681285 on 7p21.2 and rs2122469 on 8p21.3 indicated possible associations with Cmax of tamsulosin hydrochloride (P=1.29 × 10(-7), 2.15 × 10(-7), 4.35 × 10(-7) and 7.03 × 10(-7), respectively), although these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not reach the genome-wide significance threshold after Bonferroni correction. As these associated SNPs showed additive effects on serum tamsulosin hydrochloride concentration, we defined the 'Cmax prediction index' based on genotypes of these SNPs. This index clearly associated with Cmax values (P=4.5 × 10(-6)), indicating the possible roles of these four variants in tamsulosin hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Our findings would partially explain the variability of the response to the tamsulosin hydrochloride treatment.	
23160099	A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis near BMP2 and within BBS9.	Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common form of craniosynostosis, affecting approximately one in 5,000 newborns. We conducted, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide association study for nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis (sNSC) using 130 non-Hispanic case-parent trios of European ancestry (NHW). We found robust associations in a 120-kb region downstream of BMP2 flanked by rs1884302 (P = 1.13 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR) = 4.58) and rs6140226 (P = 3.40 × 10(-11), OR = 0.24) and within a 167-kb region of BBS9 between rs10262453 (P = 1.61 × 10(-10), OR = 0.19) and rs17724206 (P = 1.50 × 10(-8), OR = 0.22). We replicated the associations to both loci (rs1884302, P = 4.39 × 10(-31) and rs10262453, P = 3.50 × 10(-14)) in an independent NHW population of 172 unrelated probands with sNSC and 548 controls. Both BMP2 and BBS9 are genes with roles in skeletal development that warrant functional studies to further understand the etiology of sNSC.	 21187784 19892583 22116453 22673519 22150644 22829454 10742103 10924708 10951518 11246472 11369620 11562935 12032732 12218784 12351582 12916020 14691541 15361870 8106171 20101684 20643727 20647499 20683987 21082653 8882788 8988166 9165122 9182765 9450889 9563695 10319864 10471899 15297300 15845037 16135816 16243034 16222674 16254602 16270687 16537572 16540516 16890522 17061262 17343269 17503333 17357787 17621648 17194218 17701901 17980312 18391498 19200528 19242413 19327734 21931569

We tested the hypotheses that African ancestry and common genetic variants are associated with prolonged duration of cardiac repolarization, a central pathophysiological determinant of arrhythmia, as measured by the electrocardiographic QT interval.	 18337493 17419681 18955676 19228821 19305408 19305409 19587794 19808499 20400780 20828101 21098467 21044898 21347284 21552263 21804195 10835412 11158037 11684624 11721800 12111919 12154384 12193783 12397006 12650869 14661677 15088269 2646917 8341333 1669507 7881656 9485136 9492970 15712363 15851319 15877550 16255080 16320381 16490447 16648850 17357077 17467978 18348202
23180272	Genome-wide association study of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease in a Korean population.	Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a nonallergic clinical syndrome characterized by a severe decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) following the ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin. The effects of genetic variants have not fully explained all of the observed individual differences to an aspirin challenge despite previous attempts to identify AERD-related genes. In the present study, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) and targeted association study in Korean asthmatics to identify new genetic factors associated with AERD. A total of 685 asthmatic patients without AERD and 117 subjects with AERD were used for the GWAS of the first stage, and 996 asthmatics without AERD and 142 subjects with AERD were used for a follow-up study. A total of 702 SNPs were genotyped using the GoldenGate assay with the VeraCode microbead. GWAS revealed the top-ranked variants in 3' regions of the HLA-DPB1 gene. To investigate the detailed genetic effects of an associated region with the risk of AERD, a follow-up targeted association study with the 702 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 14 genes was performed on 802 Korean subjects. In a case-control analysis, HLA-DPB1 rs1042151 (Met105Val) shows the most significant association with the susceptibility of AERD (p = 5.11 × 10(-7); OR = 2.40). Moreover, rs1042151 also shows a gene dose for the percent decline of FEV1 after an aspirin challenge (p = 2.82 × 10(-7)). Our findings show that the HLA-DPB1 gene polymorphism may be the most susceptible genetic factor for the risk of AERD in Korean asthmatics and confirm the importance of HLA-DPB1 in the genetic etiology of AERD.	 17014432 14749922 15806396 2373527 15970796 17304886 17521312 2305394 17611496 968799 10561993 15496426 9179433 18727619 10992560 21072201 15007363 19767079 20224667 15297300 19426955 11083703 15784113 21966606 17924829 15446291 18839109 15898979 11240968 19198610 11254454 16293803

23184150	Common variation at 2q22.3 (ZEB2) influences the risk of renal cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of renal cell cancer (RCC) have identified four susceptibility loci thus far. To identify an additional RCC common susceptibility locus, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with published GWASs (totalling 2215 cases and 8566 controls of European background) and followed up the most significant association signals [nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genomic regions] in 3739 cases and 8786 controls. A combined analysis identified a novel susceptibility locus mapping to 2q22.3 marked by rs12105918 (P = 1.80 × 10(-8); odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18-1.41). The signal localizes to intron 2 of the ZEB2 gene (zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 2). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in ZEB2 influences the risk of RCC. This finding provides further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to RCC.	 19402075 18182442 19684604 19644074 20448658 21037568 21131975 21304890 21351269 21804547 22037877 22120009 22010048 22113997 22532805 7932824 12029063 22634755 8944229 16510593 17401363 17508028 17529973 19654303
23183491	Genome-wide association study identifies a potent locus associated with human opioid sensitivity.	Opioids, such as morphine and fentanyl, are widely used as effective analgesics for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. In addition, the opioid system has a key role in the rewarding effects of morphine, ethanol, cocaine and various other drugs. Although opioid sensitivity is well known to vary widely among individual subjects, several candidate genetic polymorphisms reported so far are not sufficient for fully understanding the wide range of interindividual differences in human opioid sensitivity. By conducting a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in healthy subjects, we found that genetic polymorphisms within a linkage disequilibrium block that spans 2q33.3-2q34 were strongly associated with the requirements for postoperative opioid analgesics after painful cosmetic surgery. The C allele of the best candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2952768, was associated with more analgesic requirements, and consistent results were obtained in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. In addition, carriers of the C allele in this SNP exhibited less vulnerability to severe drug dependence in patients with methamphetamine dependence, alcohol dependence, and eating disorders and a lower 'Reward Dependence' score on a personality questionnaire in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the C/C genotype of this SNP was significantly associated with the elevated expression of a neighboring gene, CREB1. These results show that SNPs in this locus are the most potent genetic factors associated with human opioid sensitivity known to date, affecting both the efficacy of opioid analgesics and liability to severe substance dependence. Our findings provide valuable information for the personalized treatment of pain and drug dependence. 	 9553006 9382783 15297300 15658508 15680959 15716906 15925706 16356648 16537460 16580900 17227776 17701901 18354400 19018716 19373277 19756153 19783098 20300088 20505179 20209629 21428770 21455057 21564555 21752352 10836142 11292005 11377918 11735033 12098591 12165570 12354627 12486188 12931138 14969743 15134646 15464123 4350037 3579504 8250684 8250685 8662559 8801636 9037090 9856954
23192594	Gene-environment interactions and obesity traits among postmenopausal African-American and Hispanic women in the Women's Health Initiative SHARe Study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of obesity measures have identified associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, no large-scale evaluation of gene-environment interactions has been performed. We conducted a search of gene-environment (G × E) interactions in post-menopausal African-American and Hispanic women from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource GWAS study. Single SNP linear regression on body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) adjusted for multidimensional-scaling-derived axes of ancestry and age was run in race-stratified data with 871,512 SNPs available from African-Americans (N = 8,203) and 786,776 SNPs from Hispanics (N = 3,484). Tests of G × E interaction at all SNPs for recreational physical activity (m h/week), dietary energy intake (kcal/day), alcohol intake (categorical), cigarette smoking years, and cigarette smoking (ever vs. never) were run in African-Americans and Hispanics adjusted for ancestry and age at interview, followed by meta-analysis of G × E interaction terms. The strongest evidence for concordant G × E interactions in African-Americans and Hispanics was for smoking and marker rs10133840 (Q statistic P = 0.70, beta = -0.01, P = 3.81 × 10(-7)) with BMI as the outcome. The strongest evidence for G × E interaction within a cohort was in African-Americans with WHR as outcome for dietary energy intake and rs9557704 (SNP × kcal = -0.04, P = 2.17 × 10(-7)). No results exceeded the Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance threshold.	 20885792 19204221 16571880 16216550 16595758 16410517 14528307 21572417 21177798 14575944 18239571 21368711 22005931 20178579 11279212 19151714 9492970 19079261 10546691 20130649 21529783 21205968 20955933 21858456 17434869 14575939 20881960 21536977 21284329 22159054 9519560 20935630 19198609 19955787 14528306 19966805 20339536 15145345 20383146 12011103 12686119 19738633 21567907 21909109 18454148 14575943 21946350 18258631 18813130 17701901 18776909 18823527 19966786 17903296 11434789 21490949 9327471 17582069 20071471 19798445 21905805 19079260 20889312 19767733
23209447	The principal genetic determinants for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China involve the HLA class I antigen recognition groove.	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy facilitated by Epstein-Barr Virus infection. Here we resolve the major genetic influences for NPC incidence using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), independent cohort replication, and high-resolution molecular HLA class I gene typing including 4,055 study participants from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong province of southern China. We detect and replicate strong association signals involving SNPs, HLA alleles, and amino acid (aa) variants across the major histocompatibility complex-HLA-A, HLA -B, and HLA -C class I genes (P(HLA-A-aa-site-62) = 7.4 × 10(-29); P (HLA-B-aa-site-116) = 6.5 × 10(-19); P (HLA-C-aa-site-156) = 6.8 × 10(-8) respectively). Over 250 NPC-HLA associated variants within HLA were analyzed in concert to resolve separate and largely independent HLA-A, -B, and -C gene influences. Multivariate logistical regression analysis collapsed significant associations in adjacent genes spanning 500 kb (OR2H1, GABBR1, HLA-F, and HCG9) as proxies for peptide binding motifs carried by HLA- A*11:01. A similar analysis resolved an independent association signal driven by HLA-B*13:01, B*38:02, and B*55:02 alleles together. NPC resistance alleles carrying the strongly associated amino acid variants implicate specific class I peptide recognition motifs in HLA-A and -B peptide binding groove as conferring strong genetic influence on the development of NPC in China.	 6874140 6895884 2443855 2377207 1651806 8537112 15515016 15726104 16848974 16862161 17701901 19296536 19478819 19664746 19683024 20008523 19933168 19838694 20460622 20072141 20512145 21239051 21296855 21219175 21499264 21828330 11386265 12464650 14963618 175020 191368 4055129
23207799	Genome-wide association study identified UQCC locus for spine bone size in humans.	Bone size (BS) contributes significantly to the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Osteoporotic spine fracture is one of the most disabling outcomes of osteoporosis. This study aims to identify genomic loci underlying spine BS variation in humans. We performed a genome-wide association scan in 2286 unrelated Caucasians using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays. Areal BS (cm(2)) at lumbar spine was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanners. SNPs of interest were subjected to replication analyses and meta-analyses with additional two independent Caucasian populations (N=1000 and 2503) and one Chinese population (N=1627). In the initial GWAS, 91 SNPs were associated with spine BS (P<1.0E-4). Eight contiguous SNPs were found clustering in a haplotype block within UQCC gene (ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase complex chaperone). Association of the above eight SNPs with spine BS was replicated in one Caucasian and one Chinese populations. Meta-analyses (N=7416) generated much stronger association signals for these SNPs (e.g., P=1.86E-07 for SNP rs6060373), supporting association of UQCC with spine BS across ethnicities. This study identified a novel locus, i.e., the UQCC gene, for spine BS variation in humans. Future functional studies will contribute to elucidating the mechanisms by which UQCC regulates bone growth and development.	 11149475 19343178 11341336 11940728 12434164 8589725 9288091 9288098 15297300 15777651 17068223 17384641 17213281 17701901 18193045 18776929 19266077 11315092
23143596	High-density genetic mapping identifies new susceptibility loci for rheumatoid arthritis.	Using the Immunochip custom SNP array, which was designed for dense genotyping of 186 loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we analyzed 11,475 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (cases) of European ancestry and 15,870 controls for 129,464 markers. We combined these data in a meta-analysis with GWAS data from additional independent cases (n = 2,363) and controls (n = 17,872). We identified 14 new susceptibility loci, 9 of which were associated with rheumatoid arthritis overall and five of which were specifically associated with disease that was positive for anticitrullinated peptide antibodies, bringing the number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci in individuals of European ancestry to 46. We refined the peak of association to a single gene for 19 loci, identified secondary independent effects at 6 loci and identified association to low-frequency variants at 4 loci. Bioinformatic analyses generated strong hypotheses for the causal SNP at seven loci. This study illustrates the advantages of dense SNP mapping analysis to inform subsequent functional investigations.	 17572673 12833157 18800157 18852200 19329491 20453842 21156761 21383967 21829388 21907864 21963258 22057235 22138821 22286218 22365150 22421339 22421340 22446960 22446963 17701901 17111354 15772666
23143594	Identification of 15 new psoriasis susceptibility loci highlights the role of innate immunity.	To gain further insight into the genetic architecture of psoriasis, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 2 independent data sets genotyped on the Immunochip, including 10,588 cases and 22,806 controls. We identified 15 new susceptibility loci, increasing to 36 the number associated with psoriasis in European individuals. We also identified, using conditional analyses, five independent signals within previously known loci. The newly identified loci shared with other autoimmune diseases include candidate genes with roles in regulating T-cell function (such as RUNX3, TAGAP and STAT3). Notably, they included candidate genes whose products are involved in innate host defense, including interferon-mediated antiviral responses (DDX58), macrophage activation (ZC3H12C) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling (CARD14 and CARM1). These results portend a better understanding of shared and distinctive genetic determinants of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders and emphasize the importance of the skin in innate and acquired host defense.	 21187856 21208785 21299892 21364948 21383967 21107349 21305677 21616437 21747375 21852963 21654830 21892172 21757742 21345260 22057235 22178530 22158552 22158560 22158561 22482804 22521418 22521419 22820512 12789169 10729226 11315092 11042166 11532989 12410315 15052270 15181474 9630218 9716595 15592573 16032514 16169848 16375659 16566820 16648858 16951344 17130451 17195845 17572673 17701901 17878325 17958839 17967903 18178554 18322180 18653518 18708155 19074283 19088203 19169253 19169254 19169255 19543373 19641206 19680446 19725839 19917777 20164929 20190752 20208533 20231379 19812592 20220767 20697158 20811451 20816167 20844574 20930145 20976248 20953187 20953188 20953189 20953190 20981092 21129726 21102463
22922229	Seven newly identified loci for autoimmune thyroid disease.	Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), including Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), is one of the most common of the immune-mediated diseases. To further investigate the genetic determinants of AITD, we conducted an association study using a custom-made single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, the ImmunoChip. The SNP array contains all known and genotype-able SNPs across 186 distinct susceptibility loci associated with one or more immune-mediated diseases. After stringent quality control, we analysed 103 875 common SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05) in 2285 GD and 462 HT patients and 9364 controls. We found evidence for seven new AITD risk loci (P < 1.12 × 10(-6); a permutation test derived significance threshold), five at locations previously associated and two at locations awaiting confirmation, with other immune-mediated diseases.	 15504986 15838509 18978792 21085122 20827270 21345260 20190752 12724780 19939292 20526339 21841780 20210668 21815908 21102463 20639879 19430480 18587394 17991429 16968788 20103030 15052270 17554300 21833088 22057235 16228001 19126779 22365150 17371467 20083159 20453842 17952073 18673466 18204448

23202124	New loci associated with birth weight identify genetic links between intrauterine             growth and adult height and metabolism.	Birth weight within the normal range is associated with a variety of adult-onset                 diseases, but the mechanisms behind these associations are poorly understood. Previous genome-wide association studies of birth weight identified                 a variant in the ADCY5 gene associated both with birth weight and type 2                 diabetes and a second variant, near CCNL1, with no obvious link to adult                     traits. In an expanded genome-wide association meta-analysis and                 follow-up study of birth weight (of up to 69,308 individuals of European descent                 from 43 studies), we have now extended the number of loci associated at genome-wide                 significance to 7, accounting for a similar proportion of variance as maternal                 smoking. Five of the loci are known to be associated with other phenotypes:                     ADCY5 and CDKAL1 with type 2 diabetes, ADRB1 with adult                 blood pressure and HMGA2 and LCORL with adult height. Our findings                 highlight genetic links between fetal growth and postnatal growth and                 metabolism.	 21444836 19633095 21909115 20016592 20081857 20081858 20233392 20372150 20509871 20581827 20490451 20686565 17463248 17463249 17572673 17603484 17603485 17701901 17456478 20616382 20682688 20818381 20881960 20935630 21058334 21874001 21873549 22504418 22504419 10799412 10973253 11315092 12111919 1957592 9662401 10348008 15677518 16415884 17293876 17503332 17384015 17460697 17463246 18372903 18391952 18463375 18803963 19060907 19266077 19228808 19734900 19592620 21407268
23209189	Genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes in Indians identifies a new susceptibility locus at 2q21.	Indians undergoing socioeconomic and lifestyle transitions will be maximally affected by epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of T2D in 12,535 Indians, a less explored but high-risk group. We identified a new type 2 diabetes-associated locus at 2q21, with the lead signal being rs6723108 (odds ratio 1.31; P = 3.32 × 10⁻⁹). Imputation analysis refined the signal to rs998451 (odds ratio 1.56; P = 6.3 × 10⁻¹²) within TMEM163 that encodes a probable vesicular transporter in nerve terminals. TMEM163 variants also showed association with decreased fasting plasma insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, indicating a plausible effect through impaired insulin secretion. The 2q21 region also harbors RAB3GAP1 and ACMSD; those are involved in neurologic disorders. Forty-nine of 56 previously reported signals showed consistency in direction with similar effect sizes in Indians and previous studies, and 25 of them were also associated (P < 0.05). Known loci and the newly identified 2q21 locus altogether explained 7.65% variance in the risk of T2D in Indians. Our study suggests that common susceptibility variants for T2D are largely the same across populations, but also reveals a population-specific locus and provides further insights into genetic architecture and etiology of T2D.	 21874001 17463246 20818381 21738890 17623043 20862305 21814221 20418489 15696165 16133172 18606306 14710970 20370913 19875164 19843166 21753830 19557197 18308848 19060907 18560169 20581827 18711367 20616382 22158537 21668449 23205164 15297300 12502614 12042425 17603485 17463248 19734900 17701901 18372903 17583797 21167468 21142536 21490949 20174558 17603484 19779445 19962207 20081858 3899825
23251661	Novel genetic loci identified for the pathophysiology of childhood obesity in the Hispanic population.	Genetic variants responsible for susceptibility to obesity and its comorbidities among Hispanic children have not been identified. The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08). Unprecedented phenotyping and high-density SNP genotyping enabled localization of novel genetic loci associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity.	 15111508 18198315 19553259 21367965 19197348 19136992 3435047 9671271 21889769 17163531 19151714 8651310 18317473 19198613 17030971 21630414 19729612 18425821 2234061 18492752 22075802 18848781 20936118 17925332 21366812 22493691 22291609 20707391 17556682 19060907 9520319 20935630 20040767 15354047 17557986 21981779 19741166 16306201 20452521 3742247 21533024 21059861 9545414 22484627 20421936 19951660 21659607 20345428 17762358 19730683 16960181 17667848 12154382 8288563 12191639 21773009 10941842 11588264 9724677 20081858 8906138 19889825
23218918	White matter integrity as an intermediate phenotype: exploratory genome-wide association analysis in individuals at high risk of bipolar disorder.	White matter integrity, as measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is reduced in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), their unaffected relatives and carriers of specific risk-alleles. Fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white matter integrity, is highly heritable but the genetic architecture of this trait has received little investigation. In this study we performed a genome-wide association study with FA as quantitative phenotype, in unaffected relatives of patients with BD (N=70) and a matched control group (N=80). Amongst our top results were SNPs located in genes involved in cell adhesion, white matter development and neuronal plasticity. Pathway analysis of the top associated polymorphisms and genes confirmed the enrichment of processes relevant to BD and white matter development, including axon guidance, ErbB-signalling neurotrophin signalling, phosphatidylinositol signalling, and cell adhesion. The majority of genes implicated in these pathways were differentially associated with FA in individuals at high familial risk, suggesting interactions with genetic background or environmental factors secondary to familial risk for BD. Although the present findings require independent replication, the results encourage the use of global FA as a quantitative phenotype in future large-scale studies which may help to identify the biological processes underlying reduced FA in BD and other psychiatric disorders.	
23207651	A genome-wide association study implicates the APOE locus in nonpathological cognitive ageing.	Cognitive decline is a feared aspect of growing old. It is a major contributor to lower quality of life and loss of independence in old age. We investigated the genetic contribution to individual differences in nonpathological cognitive ageing in five cohorts of older adults. We undertook a genome-wide association analysis using 549 692 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3511 unrelated adults in the Cognitive Ageing Genetics in England and Scotland (CAGES) project. These individuals have detailed longitudinal cognitive data from which phenotypes measuring each individual's cognitive changes were constructed. One SNP--rs2075650, located in TOMM40 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog)--had a genome-wide significant association with cognitive ageing (P=2.5 × 10(-8)). This result was replicated in a meta-analysis of three independent Swedish cohorts (P=2.41 × 10(-6)). An Apolipoprotein E (APOE) haplotype (adjacent to TOMM40), previously associated with cognitive ageing, had a significant effect on cognitive ageing in the CAGES sample (P=2.18 × 10(-8); females, P=1.66 × 10(-11); males, P=0.01). Fine SNP mapping of the TOMM40/APOE region identified both APOE (rs429358; P=3.66 × 10(-11)) and TOMM40 (rs11556505; P=2.45 × 10(-8)) as loci that were associated with cognitive ageing. Imputation and conditional analyses in the discovery and replication cohorts strongly suggest that this effect is due to APOE (rs429358). Functional genomic analysis indicated that SNPs in the TOMM40/APOE region have a functional, regulatory non-protein-coding effect. The APOE region is significantly associated with nonpathological cognitive ageing. The identity and mechanism of one or multiple causal variants remain unclear.	 16402284 18946731 12537870 15584785 17107235 8446617 16402134 12045153 17299455 19413434 19715440 1950353 16027431 8069300 15656733 15222832 22086963 21784354 14717632 11004884 22054870 19734902 22279548 2885403 11983743 12198535 17564515 22863908 19285755 16204452 20598278 20152859 17603823 19290744 21826061 20029386 21058334 3656447 18827225 21263443 7920638 22359560 17701901 17998437 11983298 15980575 19131956 8346443 22258510 21840749 22089642 8624216 17339520 9171059 18053258
23181788	HLA-DQ strikes again: genome-wide association study further confirms HLA-DQ in the diagnosis of asthma among adults.	Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in children and adults. An important genetic component to asthma susceptibility has long been recognized, most recently through the identification of several genes (e.g., ORMDL3, PDE4D, HLA-DQ, and TLE4) via genome-wide association studies.	
23213074	Association between liver-specific gene polymorphisms and their expression levels with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	Genetic factors account for a significant proportion of the phenotypic variance of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, very few predisposing genes have been identified. We aimed to (1) identify novel genetic associations with NAFLD by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS), and (2) examine the biological expression of the strongest genetic associations in a separate cohort. We performed GWAS of a population-based cohort (Raine Study) of 928 adolescents assessed for NAFLD by ultrasound at age 17. Expression of genes with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with NAFLD at a significance level of P < 10(-5) was examined in adults with NAFLD and controls by quantifying hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and serum levels of protein. After adjustment for sex and degree of adiposity, SNPs in two genes expressed in liver were associated with NAFLD adolescents: group-specific component (GC) (odds ratio [OR], 2.54; P = 1.20 × 10(-6)) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein-1 (LCP1) (OR, 3.29; P = 2.96 × 10(-6)). SNPs in two genes expressed in neurons were also associated with NAFLD: lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 (LPPR4) (OR, 2.30; P = 4.82 × 10(-6)) and solute carrier family 38 member 8 (SLC38A8) (OR, 3.14; P = 1.86 × 10(-6) ). Hepatic GC mRNA was significantly reduced (by 83%) and LCP1 mRNA was increased (by 300%) in liver biopsy samples from patients with NAFLD compared to controls (P < 0.05). Mean serum levels of GC protein were significantly lower in patients with NAFLD than controls (250 ± 90 versus 298 ± 90, respectively; P = 0.004); GC protein levels decreased with increasing severity of hepatic steatosis (P < 0.01).	
23222517	Seventy-five genetic loci influencing the human red blood cell.	Anaemia is a chief determinant of global ill health, contributing to cognitive impairment, growth retardation and impaired physical capacity. To understand further the genetic factors influencing red blood cells, we carried out a genome-wide association study of haemoglobin concentration and related parameters in up to 135,367 individuals. Here we identify 75 independent genetic loci associated with one or more red blood cell phenotypes at P < 10(-8), which together explain 4-9% of the phenotypic variance per trait. Using expression quantitative trait loci and bioinformatic strategies, we identify 121 candidate genes enriched in functions relevant to red blood cell biology. The candidate genes are expressed preferentially in red blood cell precursors, and 43 have haematopoietic phenotypes in Mus musculus or Drosophila melanogaster. Through open-chromatin and coding-variant analyses we identify potential causal genetic variants at 41 loci. Our findings provide extensive new insights into genetic mechanisms and biological pathways controlling red blood cell formation and function.	 20644199 14566336 21131981 21167468 21150441 21241896 21383967 21378987 20980556 21738486 21690102 15315760 3879975 3456593 1698556 2213941 15824203 16246985 17625558 22018786 21753176 17873877 22139419 22264824 22426310 22560525 11042311 14997420 18341630 18348202 18784119 19029536 19557189 19303047 19820697 19820698 19862010 19696200 20139978 20190752 20601676 11092890 11278356 11563973 12062105 12393545 20932932

23223146	A genome-wide association study in Caucasian women points out a putative role of the STXBP5L gene in facial photoaging.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on 502 French middle-aged Caucasian women to identify genetic factors that may affect skin aging severity. A high-throughput Illumina Human Omni1-Quad beadchip was used. After single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quality controls, 795,063 SNPs remained for analysis purposes. Possible stratification was first examined using the Eigenstrat method, and then the relationships between genotypes and four skin aging indicators (global photoaging, lentigines, wrinkles, and sagging) were investigated separately by linear regressions adjusted on age, smoking habits, lifetime sun exposure, hormonal status, and the two main Eigen vectors. One signal passed the Bonferroni threshold (P=1.53 × 10(-8)) and was significantly associated with global photoaging. It was also correlated with the wrinkling score and the sagging score. According to HapMap, this SNP, rs322458, was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with intronic SNPs of the STXBP5L gene, which is expressed in the skin. In addition, it was also in LD with another SNP that increases the expression of the FBXO40 gene in the skin. These two genes, which were not previously described in the context of aging, may constitute good candidates for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of skin photoaging.

23233662	Genome-wide study of methotrexate clearance replicates SLCO1B1.	Methotrexate clearance can influence the cure of and toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We estimated methotrexate plasma clearance for 1279 patients with ALL treated with methotrexate (24-hour infusion of a 1 g/m2 dose or 4-hour infusion of a 2 g/m2 dose) on the Children’s Oncology Group P9904 and P9905 protocols. Methotrexate clearance was lower in older children (P = 7 x 10(-7)), girls (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)), and those who received a delayed-intensification phase (P = .0022). A genome-wide analysis showed that methotrexate clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the organic anion transporter gene SLCO1B1 (P = 2.1 x 10(-11)). This replicates findings using different schedules of high-dose methotrexate in St Jude ALL treatment protocols; a combined meta-analysis yields a P value of 5.7 x 10(-19) for the association of methotrexate clearance with SLCO1B1 SNP rs4149056. Validation of this variant with 5 different treatment regimens of methotrexate solidifies the robustness of this pharmacogenomic determinant of methotrexate clearance.

23229837	TMPRSS9 and GRIN2B are associated with neuroticism: a genome-wide association study in a European sample.	Major depression disorder (MDD) is a complex and chronic disease that ranks fourth as cause of disability worldwide. About 14 million adults in the USA are believed to have MDD, and an estimated 75 % attempt suicide making MDD a major public health problem. Neuroticism has been recognized as an endophenotype of MDD; however, few genome-wide association (GWA) analyses of neuroticism as a quantitative trait have been reported to date. The aim of this study is to identify genome-wide genetic variants affecting neuroticism using a European sample. A linear regression model was used to analyze the association with neuroticism as a continuous trait in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety and Netherlands Twin Registry population-based sample of 2,748 individuals with Perlegen 600K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the neuroticism-associated genes/loci of the top 20 SNPs (p < 10⁻⁴) were examined with anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) in an Australian twin family study. Through GWA analysis, 32 neuroticism-associated SNPs (p < 10⁻⁴) were identified. The most significant association was observed with SNP rs4806846 within the TMPRSS9 gene (p = 7.79 × 10⁻⁶) at 19p13.3. The next best signal was in GRIN2B gene (rs220549, p = 1.05 × 10⁻⁵) at 12p12. In addition, several SNPs within GRIN2B showed borderline associations with ASPD in the Australian sample. In conclusion, these results provide a possible genetic basis for the association with neuroticism.

23242368	Genetic variants in STAT4 and HLA-DQ genes confer risk of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.	To identify genetic susceptibility loci for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Chinese population, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2,514 chronic HBV carriers (1,161 HCC cases and 1,353 controls) followed by a 2-stage validation among 6 independent populations of chronic HBV carriers (4,319 cases and 4,966 controls). The joint analyses showed that HCC risk was significantly associated with two independent loci: rs7574865 at STAT4, P(meta) = 2.48 × 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 1.21; and rs9275319 at HLA-DQ, P(meta) = 2.72 × 10(-17), OR = 1.49. The risk allele G at rs7574865 was significantly associated with lower mRNA levels of STAT4 in both the HCC tissues and nontumor tissues of 155 individuals with HBV-related HCC (P(trend) = 0.0008 and 0.0002, respectively). We also found significantly lower mRNA expression of STAT4 in HCC tumor tissues compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues (P = 2.33 × 10(-14)).	 19219042 21408207 18204098 17063185 21750111 19458352 10586090 22105689 20970972 19851315 18682104 22041528 19797428 20453841 19890353 20526339 15761078 21732917 17845309 10904089 21480342 17804842 20169177 1648308 21334249 20639880 20628345 20585626 17224304 20658464 12242445 19838193 20036577 20676096 17701901 18204446 17570226 21750679 21144900 20453842 21167853 19917630 21633537 8700208 21499248

23284291	Genome-wide joint meta-analysis of SNP and SNP-by-smoking interaction identifies novel loci for pulmonary function.	Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic loci for spirometic measures of pulmonary function, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), and its ratio to forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC). Given that cigarette smoking adversely affects pulmonary function, we conducted genome-wide joint meta-analyses (JMA) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and SNP-by-smoking (ever-smoking or pack-years) associations on FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC across 19 studies (total N = 50,047). We identified three novel loci not previously associated with pulmonary function. SNPs in or near DNER (smallest P(JMA = )5.00×10(-11)), HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 (smallest P(JMA = )4.35×10(-9)), and KCNJ2 and SOX9 (smallest P(JMA = )1.28×10(-8)) were associated with FEV(1)/FVC or FEV(1) in meta-analysis models including SNP main effects, smoking main effects, and SNP-by-smoking (ever-smoking or pack-years) interaction. The HLA region has been widely implicated for autoimmune and lung phenotypes, unlike the other novel loci, which have not been widely implicated. We evaluated DNER, KCNJ2, and SOX9 and found them to be expressed in human lung tissue. DNER and SOX9 further showed evidence of differential expression in human airway epithelium in smokers compared to non-smokers. Our findings demonstrated that joint testing of SNP and SNP-by-environment interaction identified novel loci associated with complex traits that are missed when considering only the genetic main effects.	 12397006 12617806 14685227 5921755 4911003 21618603 21804548 21804549 21876681 21877163 21946350 22199026 22286218 22344219 22581228 16284220 21497156 1208363 7200340 6344634 3800147 3440391 3204420 2464294 2646917 8494831 1669507 8050554 7990924 8819439 9151378 10319868 10466767 10469240 16135734 16412418 16298139 16786432 17115125 20031568 20010834 20010835 20070733 20157134 20418889 20543031 20616382 20860503 20881960 21102462 21097893 21181894 21211648 21293137 21308767 21437271 20167617 10988186 17283440 17351290 17255346 17873877 18075776 18200600 18348202 18474614 18974171 19092835 19022827 19106307 19300482 19300500 19369400 19502490 19342411 19557161 19473998 19898480 11371614 11752295 11780939 11867346 12148092
23263863	GWAS of blood cell traits identifies novel associated loci and epistatic interactions in Caucasian and African-American children.	Hematological traits are important clinical indicators, the genetic determinants of which have not been fully investigated. Common measures of hematological traits include red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin concentration (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), MCH concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count (PLT) and white blood cell (WBC) count. We carried out a genome-wide association study of the eight common hematological traits among 7943 African-American children and 6234 Caucasian children. In African Americans, we report five novel associations of HBE1 variants with HCT and MCHC, the alpha-globin gene cluster variants with RBC and MCHC, and a variant at the ARHGEF3 locus with PLT, as well as replication of four previously reported loci at genome-wide significance. In Caucasians, we report a novel association of variants at the COPZ1 locus with PLT as well as replication of four previously reported loci at genome-wide significance. Extended analysis of an association observed between MCH and the alpha-globin gene cluster variants demonstrated independent effects and epistatic interaction at the locus, impacting the risk of iron deficiency anemia in African Americans with specific genotype states. In summary, we extend the understanding of genetic variants underlying hematological traits based on analyses in African-American children.	 12225391 22277899 17572673 17701901 18179887 18245381 18408718 19110211 19180233 19198610 19221038 19543370 19543373 19592582 19820697 19862010 19880490 20139978 20172861 20232450 20616382 20927387 20704562 21167468 21153663 21208937 21483845 21738478 21738479 21738480 22139419 22423221 16862161

23266558	A genome-wide association study identifies 2 susceptibility Loci for Crohn's disease in a Japanese population.	Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease induced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic factors that affect the risk for Crohn's disease in European populations, but information from other ethnic groups is scarce. We therefore investigated genetic factors associated with Crohn's disease in the Japanese population.	
23263445	Genetic association suggests that SMOC1 mediates between prenatal sex hormones and digit ratio.	Men and women differ statistically in the relative lengths of their index and ring fingers; and the ratio of these lengths has been used as a biomarker for prenatal testosterone. The ratio has been correlated with a wide range of traits and conditions including prostate cancer, obesity, autism, ADHD, and sexual orientation. In a genome-wide association study of 979 healthy adults, we find that digit ratio is strongly associated with variation upstream of SMOC1 (rs4902759: P = 1.41 × 10(-8)) and a meta-analysis of this and an independent study shows a probability of P = 1.5 × 10(-11). The protein encoded by SMOC1 has recently been shown to play a critical role in limb development; its expression in prostate tissue is dependent on sex hormones, and it has been implicated in the sexually dimorphic development of the gonads. We put forward the hypothesis that SMOC1 provides a link between prenatal hormone exposure and digit ratio.	 19139402 21547980 12441204 21896736 12130637 16862161 9363887 16006470 15500996 22384356 11585838 20303062 16473482 18410167 22955988 19022257 18794802 2301741 6163211 21194680 15294393 19414592 18498211 16011922 20364887 16504142 17394056 21047863 18163515 9853845 4407079 19263413 21337664 17160985 22249026 12488105 20359165 22674640 16191608 7651415 22896642 20534613 16336745 17701901 9817600 19819951 21119657 20981092 19842175 15058433 21194678 16261185 15113628 17032503 19543373 20027305 21725330 21750680 21547078 20633006
23263487	Genome-wide association analyses in East Asians identify new susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer.	To identify new genetic factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a                 genome-wide association study in east Asians. By analyzing genome-wide data in 2,098                 cases and 5,749 controls, we selected 64 promising SNPs for replication in an                 independent set of samples, including up to 5,358 cases and 5,922 controls. We                 identified four SNPs with association P values of 8.58 ×                     10(-7) to 3.77 × 10(-10)                 in the combined analysis of all east Asian samples. Three of the four were                 replicated in a study conducted in 26,060 individuals of European descent, with                 combined P values of 1.22 × 10(-10) for                 rs647161 (5q31.1), 6.64 × 10(-9) for rs2423279                 (20p12.3) and 3.06 × 10(-8) for rs10774214                 (12p13.32 near the CCND2 gene), derived from meta-analysis of data from both                 east Asian and European-ancestry populations.

23263486	Genome-wide association analyses identify 18 new loci associated with serum urate concentrations.	Elevated serum urate concentrations can cause gout, a prevalent and painful inflammatory arthritis. By combining data from >140,000 individuals of European ancestry within the Global Urate Genetics Consortium (GUGC), we identified and replicated 28 genome-wide significant loci in association with serum urate concentrations (18 new regions in or near TRIM46, INHBB, SFMBT1, TMEM171, VEGFA, BAZ1B, PRKAG2, STC1, HNF4G, A1CF, ATXN2, UBE2Q2, IGF1R, NFAT5, MAF, HLF, ACVR1B-ACVRL1 and B3GNT4). Associations for many of the loci were of similar magnitude in individuals of non-European ancestry. We further characterized these loci for associations with gout, transcript expression and the fractional excretion of urate. Network analyses implicate the inhibins-activins signaling pathways and glucose metabolism in systemic urate control. New candidate genes for serum urate concentration highlight the importance of metabolic control of urate production and excretion, which may have implications for the treatment and prevention of gout.	 19506252 22155946 19995986 20190416 20516647 20562874 20616382 19557189 10907128 11874442 12415600 12883005 15014182 15290739 856219 6685961 2646917 7840165 15681023 9038591 8660991 15772301 16253630 16339094 16009445 16834837 16979398 17701901 17978310 18327256 18327257 17997608 18422468 18348202 18834626 18726182 19296889 19332629 19503597 19474294 21127244 20884846 21167468 20091036 21886157 21800283 21909115 21983786 22243964
23267103	Linkage analysis identifies a locus for plasma von Willebrand factor undetected by genome-wide association.	The plasma glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF) exhibits fivefold antigen level variation across the normal human population determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Low levels of VWF are associated with bleeding and elevated levels with increased risk for thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke. To identify additional genetic determinants of VWF antigen levels and to minimize the impact of age and illness-related environmental factors, we performed genome-wide association analysis in two young and healthy cohorts (n = 1,152 and n = 2,310) and identified signals at ABO (P < 7.9E-139) and VWF (P < 5.5E-16), consistent with previous reports. Additionally, linkage analysis based on sibling structure within the cohorts, identified significant signals at chromosome 2q12-2p13 (LOD score 5.3) and at the ABO locus on chromosome 9q34 (LOD score 2.9) that explained 19.2% and 24.5% of the variance in VWF levels, respectively. Given its strong effect, the linkage region on chromosome 2 could harbor a potentially important determinant of bleeding and thrombosis risk. The absence of a chromosome 2 association signal in this or previous association studies suggests a causative gene harboring many genetic variants that are individually rare, but in aggregate common. These results raise the possibility that similar loci could explain a significant portion of the "missing heritability" for other complex genetic traits.	 19812666 19630761 19732894 19874459 20231535 20167578 20403097 20798373 21167468 21343614 21602797 21534939 21497043 21765920 21653798 21708936 21810271 21893624 22110529 22128063 22219226 10669660 11197396 11471121 11731797 11841438 12355401 12624629 15023872 3919575 2493271 1520322 7823669 9286936 9708474 15606554 15842350 16093727 16102036 16270633 16371117 16525567 18315614 18245665 18515885 19293820 19556996 19700161
23300701	Genome-wide search for gene-gene interactions in colorectal cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. However, these susceptibility loci known today explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Gene-gene interaction (GxG) is considered to be one source of the missing heritability. To address this, we performed a genome-wide search for pair-wise GxG associated with CRC risk using 8,380 cases and 10,558 controls in the discovery phase and 2,527 cases and 2,658 controls in the replication phase. We developed a simple, but powerful method for testing interaction, which we term the Average Risk Due to Interaction (ARDI). With this method, we conducted a genome-wide search to identify SNPs showing evidence for GxG with previously identified CRC susceptibility loci from 14 independent regions. We also conducted a genome-wide search for GxG using the marginal association screening and examining interaction among SNPs that pass the screening threshold (p<10(-4)). For the known locus rs10795668 (10p14), we found an interacting SNP rs367615 (5q21) with replication p = 0.01 and combined p = 4.19×10(-8). Among the top marginal SNPs after LD pruning (n = 163), we identified an interaction between rs1571218 (20p12.3) and rs10879357 (12q21.1) (nominal combined p = 2.51×10(-6); Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.03). Our study represents the first comprehensive search for GxG in CRC, and our results may provide new insight into the genetic etiology of CRC.	 18084292 22714933 18372901 18372905 18593914 18978787 18978790 19011631 19151717 19200528 19089453 19234396 19578363 19578367 19836008 19434077 20101243 20039380 20543847 20700438 20871597 20953190 20972440 21058334 20726965 21088106 21437271 21423175 11252892 11346797 11404819 11438666 11791213 12036302 12511643 21357381 21655089 21791675 21769935 21441561 14614241 1848370 1651563 8221698 8122051 8524845 10069253 15593090 15588316 16415888 16469039 16619511 16862161 17572673 17618283 17618284 17934461 21761138 22223662 22363440 22427610 22367438 18200600
23273568	Meta-analysis followed by replication identifies loci in or near CDKN1B, TET3, CD80, DRAM1, and ARID5B as associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Asians.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype autoimmune disease with a strong genetic involvement and ethnic differences. Susceptibility genes identified so far only explain a small portion of the genetic heritability of SLE, suggesting that many more loci are yet to be uncovered for this disease. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies on SLE in Chinese Han populations and followed up the findings by replication in four additional Asian cohorts with a total of 5,365 cases and 10,054 corresponding controls. We identified genetic variants in or near CDKN1B, TET3, CD80, DRAM1, and ARID5B as associated with the disease. These findings point to potential roles of cell-cycle regulation, autophagy, and DNA demethylation in SLE pathogenesis. For the region involving TET3 and that involving CDKN1B, multiple independent SNPs were identified, highlighting a phenomenon that might partially explain the missing heritability of complex diseases.	 19194707 19617540 19684604 19675569 19652548 19838193 19838195 19923888 20169177 20530579 20562859 20445453 20616382 20516000 20733074 21194677 21044949 21386980 21159836 21355095 21326321 21532585 21778364 21728997 21892189 22046141 21885342 22004975 22087647 22247332 22446963 22972472 10700231 11483573 12077221 14514138 15504364 781465 9324032 9585231 15494350 16006622 16839881 16862161 17013388 17204602 17701901 17804842 18204446 18204448 18204098 19225526 19286673 19357697 19684603
23269536	Genome-wide association study identified novel genetic variant on SLC45A3 gene associated with serum levels prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a Chinese population.	Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a commonly used cancer biomarker for prostate cancer, and is often included as part of routine physical examinations in China. Serum levels of PSA may be influenced by genetic factors as well as other factors. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a European population successfully identified six genetic loci that were significantly associated with PSA level. In this study, we aimed to identify common genetic variants that are associated with serum level of PSA in a Chinese population. We also evaluated the effects of those variants by creating personalized PSA cutoff values. A two-stage GWAS of PSA level was performed among men age 20-69 years and self-reported cancer-free participants that underwent routine physical examinations at several hospitals in Guangxi Province, China. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with PSA levels in the first stage of sample (N = 1,999) were confirmed in the second stage of sample (N = 1,496). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the independent contribution of confirmed SNPs and known covariates, such as age, to the level of PSA. SNPs in three regions were significantly associated with levels of PSA in this two-stage GWAS, and had combined P values between 4.62 × 10(-17) and 6.45 × 10(-37). The three regions are located on 1q32.1 at SLC45A3, 10q11.23 at MSMB, and 19q13.33 at KLK3. The region 1q32.1 at SLC45A3 was identified as a novel locus. Genetic variants contributed significantly more to the variance of PSA level than known covariates such as age. Personalized cutoff values of serum PSA, calculated based on the inheritance of these associated SNPs, differ considerably among individuals. Identification of these genetic markers provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of PSA. Taking individual variation into account, these genetic variants may improve the performance of PSA to predict prostate cancer.	 16862161 11245466 15329895 17572673 22099876 21160077 10613842 18264097 21353261 10720075 17701901 14618627 19297566 21296855 15998892 23023329 22821757

23459209	ImmunoChip study implicates antigen presentation to T cells in narcolepsy.	Recent advances in the identification of susceptibility genes and environmental exposures provide broad support for a post-infectious autoimmune basis for narcolepsy/hypocretin (orexin) deficiency. We genotyped loci associated with other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in 1,886 individuals with hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy and 10,421 controls, all of European ancestry, using a custom genotyping array (ImmunoChip). Three loci located outside the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6 were significantly associated with disease risk. In addition to a strong signal in the T cell receptor alpha (TRA@), variants in two additional narcolepsy loci, Cathepsin H (CTSH) and Tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4, also called OX40L), attained genome-wide significance. These findings underline the importance of antigen presentation by HLA Class II to T cells in the pathophysiology of this autoimmune disease.	 9484418 19637232 16822283 17207713 17701901 17924348 18059267 18978792 19412176 19760068 20041589 19927159 19778912 20208533 20510730 20648403 20711174 19430480 20463324 20722033 21102987 21278746 21187296 21401738 21830272 21866560 22022579 22174698 22470463 22328086 22543379 22862152 23042114 15297300

23401653	A genome-wide association study for corneal curvature identifies the platelet-derived growth factor receptor α gene as a quantitative trait locus for eye size in white Europeans.	Corneal curvature is a key determinant of the refractive power of the eye. Variants in two genes, FKBP12-rapamycin complex-associated protein 1 (FRAP1) on chromosome 1p36.2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) on chromosome 4q12, have shown genome-wide significant association with normal variation in corneal curvature in a study of subjects of Asian origin. Variants at the PDGFRA locus have also shown genome-wide significant association with corneal astigmatism. Whether these variants influence other ocular parameters such as axial length has yet to be reported. We performed a genome-wide association study for corneal curvature in white European subjects from a population-based birth cohort, with the aim of replicating and extending the above findings.	 20008719 20142845 20139978 19875656 20616382 20580823 20835236 20835239 20851442 21031016 21058334 21095009 21155761 21436281 21640322 21505071 21665993 21757498 21911587 21726551 22144915 22150586 22150587 22194655 22491403 22665138 22969067 22507743 17392683 15980217 16123404 18300295 19249299 19526352 11773010 12700042 2035267 1559774 9543636 9597011 9602639 10359318 10508235 19587595 19779542 19420339
23291587	Genome-wide association analysis identifies new susceptibility loci for Behçet's disease and epistasis between HLA-B*51 and ERAP1.	Individuals with Behçet's disease suffer from episodic inflammation often affecting the orogenital mucosa, skin and eyes. To discover new susceptibility loci for Behçet's disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 779,465 SNPs with imputed genotypes in 1,209 Turkish individuals with Behçet's disease and 1,278 controls. We identified new associations at CCR1, STAT4 and KLRC4. Additionally, two SNPs in ERAP1, encoding ERAP1 p.Asp575Asn and p.Arg725Gln alterations, recessively conferred disease risk. These findings were replicated in 1,468 independent Turkish and/or 1,352 Japanese samples (combined meta-analysis P < 2 × 10(-9)). We also found evidence for interaction between HLA-B*51 and ERAP1 (P = 9 × 10(-4)). The CCR1 and STAT4 variants were associated with gene expression differences. Three risk loci shared with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis (the MHC class I region, ERAP1 and IL23R and the MHC class I-ERAP1 interaction), as well as two loci shared with inflammatory bowel disease (IL23R and IL10) implicate shared pathogenic pathways in the spondyloarthritides and Behçet's disease.	 17952073 17804842 19019891 19790126 20502693 20622878 20622879 20531381 20953187 20953190 20923822 21102463 21297633 21508329 21684383 21743469 22188278 12172050 14523385 15229958 4128069 4604133 7332375 1970380 9330925 9336425 10426993 10528040 15934084 16397273 16754858 17068223 17145369 17289997 17334337 17357068 19169254
23291585	Common variants in the HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 HLA class II region are associated with susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis.	To identify susceptibility loci for visceral leishmaniasis, we undertook genome-wide association studies in two populations: 989 cases and 1,089 controls from India and 357 cases in 308 Brazilian families (1,970 individuals). The HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 locus was the only region to show strong evidence of association in both populations. Replication at this region was undertaken in a second Indian population comprising 941 cases and 990 controls, and combined analysis across the three cohorts for rs9271858 at this locus showed P(combined) = 2.76 × 10(-17) and odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-1.52. A conditional analysis provided evidence for multiple associations within the HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 region, and a model in which risk differed between three groups of haplotypes better explained the signal and was significant in the Indian discovery and replication cohorts. In conclusion, the HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 HLA class II region contributes to visceral leishmaniasis susceptibility in India and Brazil, suggesting shared genetic risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis that cross the epidemiological divides of geography and parasite species.	 19465909 11169258 11254454 11255246 11334675 11355558 11561703 11793708 11851953 12475635 14523377 15041165 15307565 6984547 3100620 3435047 1783572 1347057 7810819 7741179 7595196 8543361 9180602 22693548 22706312 20356336 20208535 22171941 9355125 15297300 22983301 16380716 16532393 16968930 16998491 17008174 17108990 17122780 17701901 17660554 17924335 17955446 18060068 19366919 19388946 19397557 19543373 19915572 20018961 20137780 20208533 21209823 21666787 21742847 21833088 21892150 21345260 22001756 22057162 20694014 19812545 15990683
23291589	Genome-wide association analyses identify multiple loci associated with central corneal thickness and keratoconus.	Central corneal thickness (CCT) is associated with eye conditions including keratoconus and glaucoma. We performed a meta-analysis on >20,000 individuals in European and Asian populations that identified 16 new loci associated with CCT at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). We further showed that 2 CCT-associated loci, FOXO1 and FNDC3B, conferred relatively large risks for keratoconus in 2 cohorts with 874 cases and 6,085 controls (rs2721051 near FOXO1 had odds ratio (OR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-1.88, P = 2.7 × 10(-10), and rs4894535 in FNDC3B had OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.29-1.68, P = 4.9 × 10(-9)). FNDC3B was also associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (P = 5.6 × 10(-4); tested in 3 cohorts with 2,979 cases and 7,399 controls). Further analyses implicate the collagen and extracellular matrix pathways in the regulation of CCT.	 21873608 22003120 21984434 22243964 22426310 22570617 22570627 22171965 21282566 22828004 17198011 16938851 18452888 11689488 11593451 12049575 11328886 12477015 6700954 3513592 9005853 9298054 9493273 15914606 16431952 16488940 16877395 19557189 19571811 19765683 19896111 19661234 19710407 20126503 20485516 20502693 20598278 19556215 20714348 20616382 20835238 20719862 20938016 20881960 20574024 21151130 21098505 21427129 21532571 21664999 21738394 21706003 21665993 21979947

We conducted a genome-wide association study to search for risk alleles associated with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), using a northern European discovery set of 835 cases and 5159 controls. A region on chromosome 12q24 was associated (P = 1.4 × 10(-7)) and replicated convincingly (P = 3.9 × 10(-5)) in 798 cases and 2931 controls [per allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.27 in replication cohort, P = 7.7 × 10(-11) in combined populations]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the glypican 5 gene on chromosome 13q32 were also associated (P = 1.7 × 10(-7)) and replicated convincingly (P = 1.2 × 10(-5)) in 789 cases and 2927 controls (per allele OR = 1.31 in replication cohort, P = 3.03 × 10(-11) in combined populations). Four additional regions on chromosomes 10, 15 and 16 showed suggestive association accompanied by nominal replication. This study, the first genome-wide association study of a congenital heart malformation phenotype, provides evidence that common genetic variation influences the risk of TOF.	 8418661 3864729 8589713 9652610 16121765 16862161 17384015 17554300 17554260 17572673 17701901 17924335 18505598 19073967 19022413 19010793 19481194 19597048 19597493 19820697 19838195 19915572 20208533 20357389 20360844 20453842 20508602 20688270 20634204 20981092 21181895 21399635 21441931 21852397 22243964 22396765 22325189 22318994 22503907 22912587 22939634 11230613 11315092 11704759 12852851 14685227 8582397
23300278	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel locus contributing to type 2 diabetes susceptibility in Sikhs of Punjabi origin from India.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a multistage meta-analysis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Punjabi Sikhs from India. Our discovery GWAS in 1,616 individuals (842 case subjects) was followed by in silico replication of the top 513 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 10⁻³) in Punjabi Sikhs (n = 2,819; 801 case subjects). We further replicated 66 SNPs (P < 10⁻⁴) through genotyping in a Punjabi Sikh sample (n = 2,894; 1,711 case subjects). On combined meta-analysis in Sikh populations (n = 7,329; 3,354 case subjects), we identified a novel locus in association with T2D at 13q12 represented by a directly genotyped intronic SNP (rs9552911, P = 1.82 × 10⁻⁸) in the SGCG gene. Next, we undertook in silico replication (stage 2b) of the top 513 signals (P < 10⁻³) in 29,157 non-Sikh South Asians (10,971 case subjects) and de novo genotyping of up to 31 top signals (P < 10⁻⁴) in 10,817 South Asians (5,157 case subjects) (stage 3b). In combined South Asian meta-analysis, we observed six suggestive associations (P < 10⁻⁵ to < 10⁻⁷), including SNPs at HMG1L1/CTCFL, PLXNA4, SCAP, and chr5p11. Further evaluation of 31 top SNPs in 33,707 East Asians (16,746 case subjects) (stage 3c) and 47,117 Europeans (8,130 case subjects) (stage 3d), and joint meta-analysis of 128,127 individuals (44,358 case subjects) from 27 multiethnic studies, did not reveal any additional loci nor was there any evidence of replication for the new variant. Our findings provide new evidence on the presence of a population-specific signal in relation to T2D, which may provide additional insights into T2D pathogenesis.	 21874001 7049798 20818381 17968351 19455301 19765279 22384356 20580033 21294771 19082990 19247373 21558052 16900881 21138941 19862325 3344216 17572673 15070612 18469204 14982859 16085737 19670153 20581827 18398418 19494113 11381027 19282984 20616382 22158537 1547680 10574762 20517342 3060188 19995197 19183311 21350842 12827246 14693921 8548291 18397358 19846176 18711366 9732288 17293876 21665956 1511807 18598350 10993904 8968757 20081857 15070638 19779445 20081858
23307926	A genome-wide association study of early menopause and the combined impact of identified variants.	Early menopause (EM) affects up to 10% of the female population, reducing reproductive lifespan considerably. Currently, it constitutes the leading cause of infertility in the western world, affecting mainly those women who postpone their first pregnancy beyond the age of 30 years. The genetic aetiology of EM is largely unknown in the majority of cases. We have undertaken a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in 3493 EM cases and 13 598 controls from 10 independent studies. No novel genetic variants were discovered, but the 17 variants previously associated with normal age at natural menopause as a quantitative trait (QT) were also associated with EM and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Thus, EM has a genetic aetiology which overlaps variation in normal age at menopause and is at least partly explained by the additive effects of the same polygenic variants. The combined effect of the common variants captured by the single nucleotide polymorphism arrays was estimated to account for ∼30% of the variance in EM. The association between the combined 17 variants and the risk of EM was greater than the best validated non-genetic risk factor, smoking.	 16414322 19448621 8538488 20714348 19589949 9243205 11844303 19631481 20716613 9626112 16697313 15533358 22267201 9447350 19448619 15820835 15919682 21505370 15769979 12099629 18359953 8296776 3960433 9688387 20952801 21188402
23326239	A genome-wide integrative genomic study localizes genetic factors influencing antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1).	Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is highly prevalent worldwide, and it has been associated with infectious mononucleosis and severe diseases including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal lymphoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Although EBV has been the focus of extensive research, much still remains unknown concerning what makes some individuals more sensitive to infection and to adverse outcomes as a result of infection. Here we use an integrative genomics approach in order to localize genetic factors influencing levels of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) IgG antibodies, as a measure of history of infection with this pathogen, in large Mexican American families. Genome-wide evidence of both significant linkage and association was obtained on chromosome 6 in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and replicated in an independent Mexican American sample of large families (minimum p-value in combined analysis of both datasets is 1.4×10(-15) for SNPs rs477515 and rs2516049). Conditional association analyses indicate the presence of at least two separate loci within MHC class II, and along with lymphocyte expression data suggest genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 as the best candidates. The association signals are specific to EBV and are not found with IgG antibodies to 12 other pathogens examined, and therefore do not simply reveal a general HLA effect. We investigated whether SNPs significantly associated with diseases in which EBV is known or suspected to play a role (namely nasopharyngeal lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis) also show evidence of associated with EBNA-1 antibody levels, finding an overlap only for the HLA locus, but none elsewhere in the genome. The significance of this work is that a major locus related to EBV infection has been identified, which may ultimately reveal the underlying mechanisms by which the immune system regulates infection with this pathogen.	 10486333 19619654 15113901 18204098 19851445 16642019 19664746 9326339 18646185 16862161 21425124 921216 21037568 12115187 10951537 9356498 21521464 9151859 8769480 22018212 21270825 22046141 11791215 9768759 15978930 22233601 20598377 15657875 20159113 21368091 20405052 15273934 8901667 1653517 17599733 16455583 19525955 21996708 17909631 16896283 210392 20169177 3033269 10712219 20512145 16400619 20308568 2821817 22174698 11515035 19107979 19165919 20842512 22286212 3772018 16186814 19387459 21776012 21914625 10944566 11731797 9545414 19369946 19442287 18573815 19010793 17873875 22440091 17660818 12209518 19165918 18063667 5353242 19838193 6895884 9433612 6087149 21194677 18941528 20962850 17660817 20634204 19525953 18204447 22086417 18204446 11754673 12053178 17660530 9422107 19805575 19478819 19284285 7637746 1646614 19838195 14163670 4305626 21134959 21326321 18059267 16123354 2536894 21044949 10564545
23303382	Genome-wide association study of serum albumin:globulin ratio in Korean populations.	Low albumin:globulin (A/G) ratios are associated with vascular adverse events, nephrotic syndrome and autoimmune disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been identifying genetic variants associated with total serum protein, serum albumin and globulins, but A/G ratio has never been considered the target phenotype. To identify the genetic basis of the A/G ratio, we performed a GWAS on A/G ratio in 4205 individuals from the Ansan cohort and confirmed the results in 4637 subjects from the Ansung cohort. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of Affymetrix SNP array 5.0 were obtained from the Korean Association Resource Consortium, and we selected 290 659 common SNPs with a minor allele frequency >0.05. Genetic factors for A/G ratio were analyzed by linear regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status and alcohol drinking status as covariates. From the GWAS of the Ansan cohort, we identified two significant genome-wide signals (P-values<5 × 10(-8)) and 36 moderate signals (P-value<1.0 × 10(-4)). These 38 signals were tested in the Ansung population. Eleven SNPs from six loci (GALNT2, IRF4, HLA-DBP1, SLC31A1, FADS1 and TNFRSF13B) were replicated, with P-values<0.05. The most compelling association was observed in the TNFRSF13B locus on chromosome 17p11.2 (SNP: rs4561508), with an overall combined P-value=7.80 × 10(-24). The other significant signal was observed on chromosome 11q12.2-the FADS1 locus (SNP: rs174548)-with an overall combined P-value=3.54 × 10(-8).	
23326512	Genome-wide association study of irritable vs. elated mania suggests genetic differences between clinical subtypes of bipolar disorder.	The use of clinical features to define subtypes of a disorder may aid in gene identification for complex diseases. In particular, clinical subtypes of mania may distinguish phenotypic subgroups of bipolar subjects that may also differ genetically. To assess this possibility, we performed a genome-wide association study using genotype data from the Bipolar Genome Study (BiGS) and subjects that were categorized as having either irritable or elated mania during their most severe episode. A bipolar case-only analysis in the GAIN bipolar sample identified several genomic regions that differed between irritable and elated subjects, the most significant of which was for 33 SNPs on chromosome 13q31 (peak p = 2×10(-7)). This broad peak is in a relative gene desert over an unknown EST and between the SLITRK1 and SLITRK6 genes. Evidence for association to this region came predominantly from subjects in the sample that were originally collected as part of a family-based bipolar linkage study, rather than those collected as bipolar singletons. We then genotyped an additional sample of bipolar singleton cases and controls, and the analysis of irritable vs. elated mania in this new sample did not replicate our previous findings. However, this lack of replication is likely due to the presence of significant differences in terms of clinical co-morbity that were identified between these singleton bipolar cases and those that were selected from families segregating the disorder. Despite these clinical differences, analysis of the combined sample provided continued support for 13q31 and other regions from our initial analysis. Though genome-wide significance was not achieved, our results suggest that irritable mania results from a distinct set of genes, including a region on chromosome 13q31.	 11149935 22365631 11927177 11986984 12042185 12668356 12808435 14550773 7944874 8586965 9435757 9545414 10465107 15988478 16224024 17130148 17554300 17671286 17701901 17525972 18711365 19114987 19488044 20516154 21353194 21738484 21926972 11914174
23326517	Insights into the genetic architecture of early stage age-related macular degeneration: a genome-wide association study meta-analysis.	Genetic factors explain a majority of risk variance for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for late AMD implicate genes in complement, inflammatory and lipid pathways, the genetic architecture of early AMD has been relatively under studied. We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of early AMD, including 4,089 individuals with prevalent signs of early AMD (soft drusen and/or retinal pigment epithelial changes) and 20,453 individuals without these signs. For various published late AMD risk loci, we also compared effect sizes between early and late AMD using an additional 484 individuals with prevalent late AMD. GWAS meta-analysis confirmed previously reported association of variants at the complement factor H (CFH) (peak P = 1.5×10(-31)) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) (P = 4.3×10(-24)) loci, and suggested Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms (rs2075650; P = 1.1×10(-6)) associated with early AMD. Other possible loci that did not reach GWAS significance included variants in the zinc finger protein gene GLI3 (rs2049622; P = 8.9×10(-6)) and upstream of GLI2 (rs6721654; P = 6.5×10(-6)), encoding retinal Sonic hedgehog signalling regulators, and in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene (rs621313; P = 3.5×10(-6)), involved in melanin biosynthesis. For a range of published, late AMD risk loci, estimated effect sizes were significantly lower for early than late AMD. This study confirms the involvement of multiple established AMD risk variants in early AMD, but suggests weaker genetic effects on the risk of early AMD relative to late AMD. Several biological processes were suggested to be potentially specific for early AMD, including pathways regulating RPE cell melanin content and signalling pathways potentially involved in retinal regeneration, generating hypotheses for further investigation.	 20861866 15111581 20885792 16151432 21665990 17351290 21959373 17384015 17952075 11927430 8013888 9097791 15761122 17419683 2646917 17365815 19340012 15111582 9634502 19715440 21887094 1843453 12928288 12567264 21252205 21909106 22559899 21983787 19734902 21877163 21621261 11134897 19015224 19274532 18852200 19700477 21943158 17999355 21123754 18425071 19060911 19578364 7604360 3970124 10454290 22112056 20634204 20460622 8993697 18346089 9187303 15767473 17456821 16916985 21899805 10466585 20385826 10375510 22247473 20385819 20410501 1669507 19379736 21144031 19490914 20061627

23319801	Identification of inherited genetic variations influencing prognosis in early-onset breast cancer.	Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have begun to investigate associations between inherited genetic variations and breast cancer prognosis. Here, we report our findings from a GWAS conducted in 536 patients with early-onset breast cancer aged 40 or less at diagnosis and with a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years (SD = 1.96). Patients were selected from the Prospective Study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer. A Bonferroni correction for multiple testing determined that a P value of 1.0 × 10(-7) was a statistically significant association signal. Following quality control, we identified 487,496 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for association tests in stage 1. In stage 2, 35 SNPs with the most significant associations were genotyped in 1,516 independent cases from the same early-onset cohort. In stage 2, 11 SNPs remained associated in the same direction (P ≤ 0.05). Fixed effects meta-analysis models identified one SNP associated at close to genome wide level of significance 556 kb upstream of the ARRDC3 locus [HR = 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.33-1.96; P = 9.5 × 10(-7)]. Four further associations at or close to the PBX1, RORα, NTN1, and SYT6 loci also came close to genome-wide significance levels (P = 10(-6)). In the first ever GWAS for the identification of SNPs associated with prognosis in patients with early-onset breast cancer, we report a SNP upstream of the ARRDC3 locus as potentially associated with prognosis (median follow-up time for genotypes: CC = 4 years, CT = 3 years, and TT = 2.7 years; Wilcoxon rank-sum test CC vs. CT, P = 4 × 10(-4) and CT vs. TT, P = 0.76). Four further loci may also be associated with prognosis.	 7838158 22532573 15852360 15860560 16857060 17515570 17598882 17701901 17697367 18089785 18511948 18612148 19094228 19933162 20332263 20453838 20346151 20634204 20603614 21304890 21303223 20872241 21552555 21653198 22037553 22125492 21652578 22232737 22333603 22350413 22580825 8956795

Astigmatism is a common refractive error that reduces vision, where the curvature and refractive power of the cornea in one meridian are less than those of the perpendicular axis. It is a complex trait likely to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Twin studies of astigmatism have found approximately 60% of phenotypic variance is explained by genetic factors. This study aimed to identify susceptibility loci for astigmatism.	 18831967 19180258 19700477 20233392 20509871 20835236 20835239 21058334 21148184 21505071 22005280 22144915 8801636 10595508 10866000 11165860 11315092 11328732 11731797 11830579 11936436 12111919 12322931 12503095 14747757 14666375 7276418 1833235 8120697 8896571 9718344 10428590 10421837 10485894 15905411 16255080 16283989 16877283 17077675 17254428 17384015 17572673 17701901 18200594 18385047 18695106 19474294
23319000	Genome-wide association study of monoamine metabolite levels in human cerebrospinal fluid.	Studying genetic determinants of intermediate phenotypes is a powerful tool to increase our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations. Metabolic traits pertinent to the central nervous system (CNS) constitute a potentially informative target for genetic studies of intermediate phenotypes as their genetic underpinnings may elucidate etiological mechanisms. We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of monoamine metabolite (MM) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 414 human subjects from the general population. In a linear model correcting for covariates, we identified one locus associated with MMs at a genome-wide significant level (standardized β=0.32, P=4.92 × 10(-8)), located 20 kb from SSTR1, a gene involved with brain signal transduction and glutamate receptor signaling. By subsequent whole-genome expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, we provide evidence that this variant controls expression of PDE9A (β=0.21; P unadjusted=5.6 × 10(-7); P corrected=0.014), a gene previously implicated in monoaminergic transmission, major depressive disorder and antidepressant response. A post hoc analysis of loci significantly associated with psychiatric disorders suggested that genetic variation at CSMD1, a schizophrenia susceptibility locus, plays a role in the ratio between dopamine and serotonin metabolites in CSF. The presented DNA and mRNA analyses yielded genome-wide and suggestive associations in biologically plausible genes, two of which encode proteins involved with glutamate receptor functionality. These findings will hopefully contribute to an exploration of the functional impact of the highlighted genes on monoaminergic transmission and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.	 19404257 18179900 20717559 19043545 21572414 21619887 7522267 21672551 21982424 11698617 9013396 12573388 8815801 17551090 12499305 20368705 18310141 19112506 18444257 22549119 21572415 18300295 22820512 21196542 20386566 22312427 22286219 16227987 15107182 16150925 12084853 17008408 19788915 22064162 21777827 14501210 16646809 19344640 19923886 16883304 12721547 21058334 20732625 1360663 18467348 17924348 18932104 22504458 22654729 7688210 17701901 21042317 16770335 17884980 15039003 18395805 17299512 10867119 21439553 19919087 9880581 22328573 1155031 15102340 18178591

23349640	Susceptibility loci associated with specific and shared subtypes of lymphoid malignancies.	The genetics of lymphoma susceptibility reflect the marked heterogeneity of diseases that comprise this broad phenotype. However, multiple subtypes of lymphoma are observed in some families, suggesting shared pathways of genetic predisposition to these pathologically distinct entities. Using a two-stage GWAS, we tested 530,583 SNPs in 944 cases of lymphoma, including 282 familial cases, and 4,044 public shared controls, followed by genotyping of 50 SNPs in 1,245 cases and 2,596 controls. A novel region on 11q12.1 showed association with combined lymphoma (LYM) subtypes. SNPs in this region included rs12289961 near LPXN, (P(LYM) = 3.89×10(-8), OR = 1.29) and rs948562 (P(LYM) = 5.85×10(-7), OR = 1.29). A SNP in a novel non-HLA region on 6p23 (rs707824, P(NHL) = 5.72×10(-7)) was suggestive of an association conferring susceptibility to lymphoma. Four SNPs, all in a previously reported HLA region, 6p21.32, showed genome-wide significant associations with follicular lymphoma. The most significant association with follicular lymphoma was for rs4530903 (P(FL) = 2.69×10(-12), OR = 1.93). Three novel SNPs near the HLA locus, rs9268853, rs2647046, and rs2621416, demonstrated additional variation contributing toward genetic susceptibility to FL associated with this region. Genes implicated by GWAS were also found to be cis-eQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines; candidate genes in these regions have been implicated in hematopoiesis and immune function. These results, showing novel susceptibility regions and allelic heterogeneity, point to the existence of pathways of susceptibility to both shared as well as specific subtypes of lymphoid malignancy.	 19620980 19543373 19760607 19759154 20064376 20598278 20639881 20718045 20634204 20585100 20702402 21037568 21297633 21533074 21471979 21596858 21653640 21796119 21804550 21849791 22237106 10604475 12177110 12227737 15136663 15291981 8230284 9681073 15320871 15297300 16287762 16862161 16715513 17701901 17640867 18477402 18776909 18852200 19644074
23341777	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus at 12q23.1 for lung squamous cell carcinoma in han chinese.	Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) are two major histological subtypes of lung cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have made considerable advances in the understanding of lung cancer susceptibility. Obvious heterogeneity has been observed between different histological subtypes of lung cancer, but genetic determinants in specific to lung SqCC have not been systematically investigated. Here, we performed the GWAS analysis specifically for lung SqCC in 833 SqCC cases and 3,094 controls followed by a two-stage replication in additional 2,223 lung SqCC cases and 6,409 controls from Chinese populations. We found that rs12296850 in SLC17A8-NR1H4 gene region at12q23.1 was significantly associated with risk of lung SqCC at genome-wide significance level [additive model: odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-0.84, P = 1.19×10(-10)]. Subjects carrying AG or GG genotype had a 26% (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.81) or 32% (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.56-0.83) decreased risk of lung SqCC, respectively, as compared with AA genotype. However, we did not observe significant association between rs12296850 and risk of lung AC in a total of 4,368 cases with lung AC and 9,486 controls (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90-1.02, P = 0.173). These results indicate that genetic variations on chromosome 12q23.1 may specifically contribute to lung SqCC susceptibility in Chinese population.	 19644074 19275551 19836008 20304703 20220756 20220758 20502693 20700438 20871597 20876614 21296855 21439373 21725308 21911369 21750109 21866343 22439939 22585858 22367405 22344256 22797724 19369581 11901921 15378005 15867356 16025147 16203770 16927450 17873874 17873877 17982457 18385738 18385739 18437076 18385676 18462017 18390646 18729187 18846210 18978787 18978790 19047134 19164095 18981289 19643732

23354978	Genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk for Ashkenazi Jewish women with strong family histories but no identifiable BRCA1/2 mutation.	The ability to establish genetic risk models is critical for early identification and optimal treatment of breast cancer. For such a model to gain clinical utility, more variants must be identified beyond those discovered in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This is especially true for women at high risk because of family history, but without BRCA1/2 mutations. This study incorporates three datasets in a GWAS analysis of women with Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) homogeneous ancestry. Two independent discovery cohorts comprised 239 and 238 AJ women with invasive breast cancer or preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ and strong family histories of breast cancer, but lacking the three BRCA1/2 founder mutations, along with 294 and 230 AJ controls, respectively. An independent, third cohort of 203 AJ cases with familial breast cancer history and 263 healthy controls of AJ women was used for validation. A total of 19 SNPs were identified as associated with familial breast cancer risk in AJ women. Among these SNPs, 13 were identified from a panel of 109 discovery SNPs, including an FGFR2 haplotype. In addition, six previously identified breast cancer GWAS SNPs were confirmed in this population. Seven of the 19 markers were significant in a multivariate predictive model of familial breast cancer in AJ women, three novel SNPs [rs17663555(5q13.2), rs566164(6q21), and rs11075884(16q22.2)], the FGFR2 haplotype, and three previously published SNPs [rs13387042(2q35), rs2046210(ESR1), and rs3112612(TOX3)], yielding moderate predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC (receiver-operator characteristic curve) of 0.74. Population-specific genetic variants in addition to variants shared with populations of European ancestry may improve breast cancer risk prediction among AJ women from high-risk families without founder BRCA1/2 mutations.	 20610543 20616022 20872241 21504706 21685461 21730125 21812969 22045194 21866343 22412388 22183176 11250676 12782593 12958120 14601027 15136663 15217505 15208783 8118824 9108466 15516849 16551709 16783572 17044060 17200668 17293864 17529973 17529974 17529967 17701901 17999361 18326623 18483326 18398821 19219042 19330027 19330030 19161619 19596254 19927315 20403315 20434130 20453838 20359883 20585626 21263130

23358160	Genome-wide study of association and interaction with maternal cytomegalovirus infection suggests new schizophrenia loci.	Genetic and environmental components as well as their interaction contribute to the risk of schizophrenia, making it highly relevant to include environmental factors in genetic studies of schizophrenia. This study comprises genome-wide association (GWA) and follow-up analyses of all individuals born in Denmark since 1981 and diagnosed with schizophrenia as well as controls from the same birth cohort. Furthermore, we present the first genome-wide interaction survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and maternal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The GWA analysis included 888 cases and 882 controls, and the follow-up investigation of the top GWA results was performed in independent Danish (1396 cases and 1803 controls) and German-Dutch (1169 cases, 3714 controls) samples. The SNPs most strongly associated in the single-marker analysis of the combined Danish samples were rs4757144 in ARNTL (P=3.78 × 10(-6)) and rs8057927 in CDH13 (P=1.39 × 10(-5)). Both genes have previously been linked to schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders. The strongest associated SNP in the combined analysis, including Danish and German-Dutch samples, was rs12922317 in RUNDC2A (P=9.04 × 10(-7)). A region-based analysis summarizing independent signals in segments of 100 kb identified a new region-based genome-wide significant locus overlapping the gene ZEB1 (P=7.0 × 10(-7)). This signal was replicated in the follow-up analysis (P=2.3 × 10(-2)). Significant interaction with maternal CMV infection was found for rs7902091 (P(SNP × CMV)=7.3 × 10(-7)) in CTNNA3, a gene not previously implicated in schizophrenia, stressing the importance of including environmental factors in genetic studies.	 17981263 18668039 17632694 21822266 19571809 17761686 17194218 21775352 19575812 22344220 17912601 21374718 19022827 19197363 21055719 20825314 11524377 19693800 19839995 2404658 11590244 8573335 18821565 20800221 16025097 15075440 17029132 19105203 21489405 20190755 19116147 21454296 19317969 16415888 21747397 18988193 17133224 17453677 16687321 18839057 8898229 20346398 18163421 21791550 20185149 3001953 11109296 10702717 18758442 20732627 19571808 20678249 17561376 17573676 10737605 19404256 20598509 10813800 21919190 21853134 18791076 16507006 19295128 19223858 20072116 16528748 17701901 20036349 19025758 21407268 18980221 9442870 9523395 21658581 15800151 7909693 19571811 17150149 21430674 17098871 14662550 16598713 15289276
23374588	Pharmacogenomics in Alzheimer's disease: a genome-wide association study of response to cholinesterase inhibitors.	We conducted a genome-wide association study in a cohort of 176 Italian Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with extreme phenotype of response to cholinesterase inhibitors. Patients were classified into responders in case of positive, stable, or ≤1 worsening of mini-mental state examination score and into nonresponders if >3 points worsening during a median follow-up of 0.85 years of treatment. Forty-eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms were selected for replication in 198 additional AD-treated patients. By using the dichotomous response trait and a quantitative trait approach (change of mini-mental state examination), a nominal replication and evidence of association when combining data were achieved for 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with response to treatment: rs6720975A (pcombined = 2.9 × 10(-5), beta regression coefficient: 1.61) and rs17798800A (pcombined = 6.8 × 10(-6), odds ratio = 0.38, 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.58). Rs6720975 maps in the intronic region of PRKCE, a protein kinase involved in several cellular functions, whereas rs17798800 is intergenic and, according to expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, it acts as a cis-regulator of NBEA, an A kinase-anchoring protein playing a substantial role in the maturation of the nervous system. Despite its limitations, this project paves the way for the application of personalized medicine in AD patients and for collaborative efforts in this field.	
23358156	Childhood intelligence is heritable, highly polygenic and associated with FNBP1L.	Intelligence in childhood, as measured by psychometric cognitive tests, is a strong predictor of many important life outcomes, including educational attainment, income, health and lifespan. Results from twin, family and adoption studies are consistent with general intelligence being highly heritable and genetically stable throughout the life course. No robustly associated genetic loci or variants for childhood intelligence have been reported. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on childhood intelligence (age range 6-18 years) from 17,989 individuals in six discovery and three replication samples. Although no individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected with genome-wide significance, we show that the aggregate effects of common SNPs explain 22-46% of phenotypic variation in childhood intelligence in the three largest cohorts (P=3.9 × 10(-15), 0.014 and 0.028). FNBP1L, previously reported to be the most significantly associated gene for adult intelligence, was also significantly associated with childhood intelligence (P=0.003). Polygenic prediction analyses resulted in a significant correlation between predictor and outcome in all replication cohorts. The proportion of childhood intelligence explained by the predictor reached 1.2% (P=6 × 10(-5)), 3.5% (P=10(-3)) and 0.5% (P=6 × 10(-5)) in three independent validation cohorts. Given the sample sizes, these genetic prediction results are consistent with expectations if the genetic architecture of childhood intelligence is like that of body mass index or height. Our study provides molecular support for the heritability and polygenic nature of childhood intelligence. Larger sample sizes will be required to detect individual variants with genome-wide significance.	 19430479 21826061 20686565 20598278 20562875 20060087 19734545 19294424 19474294 19200528 18067574 17701901 17572673 15260990 20616382 23012269 22139419 21943169 20881960 19488046 20935630 21058334 20306291 21142928 21552263 21407268
23362303	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with concentrations of four plasma phospholipid fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway: results from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium.	BACKGROUND- Palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), and oleic acid (18:1n-9) are major saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids that affect cellular signaling and metabolic pathways. They are synthesized via de novo lipogenesis and are the main saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Levels of these fatty acids have been linked to diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS- Genome-wide association studies were conducted in 5 population-based cohorts comprising 8961 participants of European ancestry to investigate the association of common genetic variation with plasma levels of these 4 fatty acids. We identified polymorphisms in 7 novel loci associated with circulating levels of ≥1 of these fatty acids. ALG14 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 homolog) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:0 (P=2.7×10(-11)) and lower 18:0 (P=2.2×10(-18)). FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7 (P=6.6×10(-13)) and 18:1n-9 (P=2.2×10(-32)) and lower 18:0 (P=1.3×10(-20)). LPGAT1 (lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase) polymorphisms were associated with lower 18:0 (P=2.8×10(-9)). GCKR (glucokinase regulator; P=9.8×10(-10)) and HIF1AN (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1; P=5.7×10(-9)) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7, whereas PKD2L1 (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1; P=5.7×10(-15)) and a locus on chromosome 2 (not near known genes) were associated with lower 16:1n-7 (P=4.1×10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS- Our findings provide novel evidence that common variations in genes with diverse functions, including protein-glycosylation, polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, phospholipid modeling, and glucose- and oxygen-sensing pathways, are associated with circulating levels of 4 fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway. These results expand our knowledge of genetic factors relevant to de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid biology.	 18805087 18614742 18776140 19061714 19081067 18718904 19056549 18726182 19200528 19369661 19363290 19066317 19635840 19646743 19643913 19812697 19809313 20351238 20399150 20406802 20045147 20228221 20861175 20943795 21058334 20980488 21106917 20889351 21532591 21829377 21677304 22359512 21697077 10539756 10875926 11118295 11160538 11876260 12816776 7677125 8712189 8839937 9565565 9643360 9878261 10472949 15485873 16054078 16123334 16100110 16469979 16564093 16507783 17572673 17616765 17616780 16962297 17676998 17686769 18259201 18442630 18435934 18678614
23382809	BCL9 and C9orf5 are associated with negative symptoms in schizophrenia: meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies.	Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric condition affecting slightly more than 1% of the population worldwide and it is a multifactorial disorder with a high degree of heritability (80%) based on family and twin studies. Increasing lines of evidence suggest intermediate phenotypes/endophenotypes are more associated with causes of the disease and are less genetically complex than the broader disease spectrum. Negative symptoms in schizophrenia are attractive intermediate phenotypes based on their clinical and treatment response features. Therefore, our objective was to identify genetic variants underlying the negative symptoms of schizophrenia by analyzing two genome-wide association (GWA) data sets consisting of a total of 1,774 European-American patients and 2,726 controls. Logistic regression analysis of negative symptoms as a binary trait (adjusted for age and sex) was performed using PLINK. For meta-analysis of two datasets, the fixed-effect model in PLINK was applied. Through meta-analysis we identified 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with negative symptoms with p<5×10(-5). Especially we detected five SNPs in the first two genes/loci strongly associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia (P(meta-analysis)<6.22×10(-6)), which included three SNPs in the BCL9 gene: rs583583 showed the strongest association at a P(meta-analysis) of 6.00×10(-7) and two SNPs in the C9orf5 (the top SNP is rs643410 with a p = 1.29 ×10(-6)). Through meta-analysis, we identified several additional negative symptoms associated genes (ST3GAL1, RNF144, CTNNA3 and ZNF385D). This is the first report of the common variants influencing negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These results provide direct evidence of using of negative symptoms as an intermediate phenotype to dissect the complex genetics of schizophrenia. However, additional studies are warranted to examine the underlying mechanisms of these disease-associated SNPs in these genes.	 17716071 18668039 19571809 16229822 17761686 20439386 16481659 22424231 18668038 21383261 18677311 19539887 10514809 18627596 20142819 15913960 21414604 21312410 16842980 12499305 20485477 12770514 9490669 18711365 21130836 18683247 21176025 9176922 20306291 20433910 18163421 20159339 10564813 8102296 18180429 20952758 18198266 20195266 21598020 18344044 20716857 17554300 18606951 18676839 1931805 17701901 18163389 20600988 7917293 15832199 15140279 14662550 21498463
23372041	Novel locus including FGF21 is associated with dietary macronutrient intake.	Dietary intake of macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) has been associated with risk of chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Family studies have reported a moderate contribution of genetics to variation in macronutrient intake. In a genome-wide meta-analysis of a population-based discovery cohort (n = 33 533), rs838133 in FGF21 (19q13.33), rs197273 near TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator (TANK) (2p24.2), and rs10163409 in FTO (16q12.2) were among the top associations (P < 10(-5)) for percentage of total caloric intake from protein and carbohydrate. rs838133 was replicated in silico in an independent sample from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (CHARGE) Nutrition Working Group (n = 38 360) and attained genome-wide significance in combined analysis (Pjoint = 7.9 × 10(-9)). A cytokine involved in cellular metabolism, FGF21 is a potential susceptibility gene for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our results highlight the potential of genetic variation for determining dietary macronutrient intake.	 11010932 23636237 3794132 1678444 1632423 7876234 9519563 15864280 16848714 17529973 17943122 18070814 18059457 17926232 18252893 18776911 18697794 18687777 19470704 20031568 20233392 20418489 20357365 20616382 20702402 20935630 21058334 21142928 21167468 21829679 21880673 22221213 22304921 22885922 22941192 22933429 4014201

23386860	Exploring genome-wide - dietary heme iron intake interactions and the risk of type 2 diabetes.	Genome-wide association studies have identified over 50 new genetic loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Several studies conclude that higher dietary heme iron intake increases the risk of T2D. Therefore we assessed whether the relation between genetic loci and T2D is modified by dietary heme iron intake.	 10607817 23046549 14871914 14712349 15333470 510803 7416342 2343859 1681160 9203460 9356019 9732340 16306377 16732023 17014365 18606887 20010968 20418489 21181894 22243964 22199026 14684399
23382691	Loci associated with N-glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G show pleiotropy with autoimmune diseases and haematological cancers.	Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247 individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of 1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P<2.27 × 10(-9)) in the discovery analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation of a single plasma protein using GWAS. The results may also provide an explanation for the reported pleiotropy and antagonistic effects of loci involved in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.	 10816579 11484692 11986321 12479824 12542478 12427744 12829606 7138600 6662267 3927174 3493322 3674386 8224606 8670078 9063885 9435248 15903235 16251894 16102830 16449189 16330541 16675584 16888140 16953439 17153858 17384015 17714731 17616514 17506657 18064051 18223637 17659840 18327257 18348202 18587394 18760389 18815375 18978792 18840781 19124510 19122664 19260141 19285412 19414557 19684603 19684604 19838193 19838195 19862010 19915572 19915573 20042726 20190752 20228799 20164836 20453842 20480216 20802204 20711174 20634204 20830288 19430480 19465909 20834067 21102463 20974899 21203500 21297633 21270240 21408207 21399635 21372248 21431839 21445428 21658281 20585324 21779181 21829393 21833088 21841780 21874001 21653738 21865298 22023369 22001757 22046141 22077970 21908519 22086417 22189269 10536042
23364394	A genome-wide association study of a coronary artery disease risk variant.	Although over 30 common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified to be independently associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk variants reported to date explain only a small fraction of heritability. To identify novel susceptibility variants for CAD and confirm those previously identified in European population, GWAS and a replication study were performed in the Koreans and Japanese. In the discovery stage, we genotyped 2123 cases and 3591 controls with 521 786 SNPs using the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 chips in Korean. In the replication, direct genotyping was performed using 3052 cases and 4976 controls from the KItaNagoya Genome study of Japan with 14 selected SNPs. To maximize the coverage of the genome, imputation was performed based on 1000 Genome JPT+CHB and 5.1 million SNPs were retained. CAD association was replicated for three GWAS-identified loci (1p13.3/SORT1 (rs599839), 9p21.3/CDKN2A/2B (rs4977574), and 11q22.3/ PDGFD (rs974819)) in Koreans. From GWAS and a replication, SNP rs3782889 showed a strong association (combined P=3.95 × 10(-14)), although the association of SNP rs3782889 doesn't remain statistically significant after adjusting for SNP rs11066015 (proxy SNP with BRAP (r(2)=1)). But new possible CAD-associated variant was observed for rs9508025 (FLT1), even though its statistical significance did marginally reach at the genome-wide a significance level (combined P=6.07 × 10(-7)). This study shows that three CAD susceptibility loci, which were previously identified in European can be directly replicated in Koreans and also provides additional evidences implicating suggestive loci as risk variants for CAD in East Asian.	
23371916	A genome-wide association study for serum bilirubin levels and gene-environment interaction in a Chinese population.	Bilirubin is an effective antioxidant and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci affecting serum total bilirubin levels. However, most of the studies were conducted in European populations and little attention has been devoted either to genetic variants associated with direct and indirect bilirubin levels or to the gene-environment interactions on bilirubin levels. In this study, a two-stage GWAS was performed to identify genetic variants associated with all types of bilirubin levels in 10,282 Han Chinese individuals. Gene-environment interactions were further examined. Briefly, two previously reported loci, UGT1A1 on 2q37 (rs6742078 and rs4148323, combined P = 1.44 × 10(-89) and P = 5.05 × 10(-69) , respectively) and SLCO1B3 on 12p12 (rs2417940, combined P = 6.93 × 10(-19) ) were successfully replicated. The two loci explained 9.2% and 0.9% of the total variations of total bilirubin levels, respectively. Ethnic genetic differences were observed between Chinese and European populations. More importantly, a significant interaction was found between rs2417940 in SLCO1B3 gene and smoking on total bilirubin levels (P = 1.99 × 10(-3) ). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2417940 had stronger effects on total bilirubin levels in nonsmokers than in smokers, suggesting that the effects of SLCO1B3 genotype on bilirubin levels were partly dependent on smoking status. Consistent associations and interactions were observed for serum direct and indirect bilirubin levels.

23378610	Genetic variants associated with glycine metabolism and their role in insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes.	Circulating metabolites associated with insulin sensitivity may represent useful biomarkers, but their causal role in insulin sensitivity and diabetes is less certain. We previously identified novel metabolites correlated with insulin sensitivity measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The top-ranking metabolites were in the glutathione and glycine biosynthesis pathways. We aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with metabolites in these pathways and test their role in insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes. With 1,004 nondiabetic individuals from the RISC study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 14 insulin sensitivity-related metabolites and one metabolite ratio. We replicated our results in the Botnia study (n = 342). We assessed the association of these variants with diabetes-related traits in GWAS meta-analyses (GENESIS [including RISC, EUGENE2, and Stanford], MAGIC, and DIAGRAM). We identified four associations with three metabolites-glycine (rs715 at CPS1), serine (rs478093 at PHGDH), and betaine (rs499368 at SLC6A12; rs17823642 at BHMT)-and one association signal with glycine-to-serine ratio (rs1107366 at ALDH1L1). There was no robust evidence for association between these variants and insulin resistance or diabetes. Genetic variants associated with genes in the glycine biosynthesis pathways do not provide consistent evidence for a role of glycine in diabetes-related traits.	 1737525 7014307 9686343 17466535 17956307 18029478 17886233 18384253 11073719 11135089 12848526 12730242 15321791 5032528 23439165 7112124 6416909 18324385 18372322 18682704 19148276 19356713 19380839 19715440 19502541 19933169 20037589 20081858 20195502 19624122 20154341 20526369 20581827 20616382 21058334 21170321 20921216 20929994 21093336 21282362 21423183 21852955 21886157 22039354 23010998 22977272 23043162 9166672

23381795	Genome-wide association study on plasma levels of midregional-proadrenomedullin and C-terminal-pro-endothelin-1.	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and adrenomedullin (ADM) are circulating vasoactive peptides involved in vascular homeostasis and endothelial function. Elevated levels of plasma ET-1 and ADM, and their biologically stable surrogates, C-terminal-pro-endothelin-1 (CT-pro-ET-1) and midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-pro-ADM), are predictors of cardiac death and heart failure. We studied the association of common genetic variation with MR-pro-ADM and CT-pro-ET-1 by genome-wide association analyses in 3444 participants of European ancestry. We performed follow-up genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed suggestive or significant association in the discovery stage in additional 3230 participants. The minor variants in KLKB1 (rs4253238) and F12 (rs2731672), both part of the kallikrein-kinin system, were associated with higher MR-pro-ADM (P=4.46E-52 and P=5.90E-24, respectively) and higher CT-pro-ET-1 levels (P=1.23E-122 and P=1.26E-67, respectively). Epistasis analyses showed a significant interaction between the sentinel SNP of F12 and KLKB1 for both traits. In addition, a variant near the ADM gene (rs2957692) was associated with MR-pro-ADM (P=1.05E-12) and a variant in EDN-1 (rs5370) was associated with CT-pro-ET-1 (P=1.49E-27). The total phenotypic variation explained by the genetic variants was 7.2% for MR-pro-ADM and 14.6% for CT-pro-ET-1. KLKB1 encodes plasma kallikrein, a proteolytic enzyme known to cleave high-molecular-weight kininogen to bradykinin and prorenin to renin. We cloned the precursors of ADM and ET-1 and demonstrated that purified plasma kallikrein can cleave these recombinant proteins into multiple smaller peptides. The discovery of genetic variants in the kallikrein-kinin system and in the genes encoding pre-pro-ET-1 and pre-pro-ADM provides novel insights into the (co-)regulation of these vasoactive peptides in the vascular system.

23408906	A meta-analysis of thyroid-related traits reveals novel loci and gender-specific differences in the regulation of thyroid function.	Thyroid hormone is essential for normal metabolism and development, and overt abnormalities in thyroid function lead to common endocrine disorders affecting approximately 10% of individuals over their life span. In addition, even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders. To identify novel variants underlying thyroid function, we performed a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for serum levels of the highly heritable thyroid function markers TSH and FT4, in up to 26,420 and 17,520 euthyroid subjects, respectively. Here we report 26 independent associations, including several novel loci for TSH (PDE10A, VEGFA, IGFBP5, NFIA, SOX9, PRDM11, FGF7, INSR, ABO, MIR1179, NRG1, MBIP, ITPK1, SASH1, GLIS3) and FT4 (LHX3, FOXE1, AADAT, NETO1/FBXO15, LPCAT2/CAPNS2). Notably, only limited overlap was detected between TSH and FT4 associated signals, in spite of the feedback regulation of their circulating levels by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Five of the reported loci (PDE8B, PDE10A, MAF/LOC440389, NETO1/FBXO15, and LPCAT2/CAPNS2) show strong gender-specific differences, which offer clues for the known sexual dimorphism in thyroid function and related pathologies. Importantly, the TSH-associated loci contribute not only to variation within the normal range, but also to TSH values outside the reference range, suggesting that they may be involved in thyroid dysfunction. Overall, our findings explain, respectively, 5.64% and 2.30% of total TSH and FT4 trait variance, and they improve the current knowledge of the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function and the consequences of genetic variation for hypo- or hyperthyroidism.	 22267200 17970774 16715098 22039511 15845376 18276786 19268309 22586128 12788902 21367965 20189936 7103627 11889165 10668202 11046146 20714348 19648646 17105838 18492748 18407919 19198613 11788654 19179434 16839256 11519506 21473761 8638120 7559606 17327381 15798018 17456567 19861975 17572673 10518556 7681763 22493691 22291609 10801814 18514160 11836274 12364419 8768874 12618333 20616382 8964573 21981779 21565293 9697704 9697705 11728924 19557189 19914276 20826269 16804039 10995803 19826765 15240603 21058334 16934002 17991805 12126930 17991452 21690246 11180951 10835633 20350937 20634204 19730683 11474665 21317282 18815314 15001606 22494929 21093207 16020927 19820008 12136106 19543373 18673466 12907760 21058882 3933400 21136677
23396134	Genome-wide meta-analyses of multiancestry cohorts identify multiple new susceptibility loci for refractive error and myopia.	Refractive error is the most common eye disorder worldwide and is a prominent cause of blindness. Myopia affects over 30% of Western populations and up to 80% of Asians. The CREAM consortium conducted genome-wide meta-analyses, including 37,382 individuals from 27 studies of European ancestry and 8,376 from 5 Asian cohorts. We identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. Combined analysis identified 8 additional associated loci. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission (GRIA4), ion transport (KCNQ5), retinoic acid metabolism (RDH5), extracellular matrix remodeling (LAMA2 and BMP2) and eye development (SIX6 and PRSS56). We also confirmed previously reported associations with GJD2 and RASGRF1. Risk score analysis using associated SNPs showed a tenfold increased risk of myopia for individuals carrying the highest genetic load. Our results, based on a large meta-analysis across independent multiancestry studies, considerably advance understanding of the mechanisms involved in refractive error and myopia.	 21155761 17924335 21406186 21532570 21640322 21407268 21505071 21850159 21795522 22064851 22135213 22504420 22685421 22665138 22955616 22879416 22730494 21397065 17893662 17426950 17572673 16638980 12925520 14751549 10866000 11752295 18316356 19379482 19565121 19457086 19587322 19779542 20233392 20479888 20548946 20509871 20616382 20634204 20835236 20835239 20935630 21058334 20801113 21249183 21095009 16079001 16123404 10103089 2035267 15266624
23400010	Genome-wide association analyses suggest NELL1 influences adverse metabolic response to HCTZ in African Americans.	Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is one of the most widely prescribed antihypertensive medications. Although it is well known that HCTZ is associated with hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are not well understood. We performed a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of the change in fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides in response to HCTZ from two different clinical trials: the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses and the Genetic Epidemiology of Responses to Antihypertensive studies. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs12279250 and rs4319515 (r(2)=0.73)), located at 11p15.1 in the NELL1 gene, achieved genome-wide significance for association with change in fasting plasma triglycerides in African Americans, whereby each variant allele was associated with a 28 mg dl(-1) increase in the change in triglycerides. NELL1 encodes a cytoplasmic protein that contains epidermal growth factor-like repeats and has been shown to represses adipogenic differentiation. These findings may represent a novel mechanism underlying HCTZ-induced adverse metabolic effects. 	 11368251 19065516 11943743 12235118 14981670 19077436 19249413 19564550 19715440 19447061 19792989 20081858 19851299 20233392 20397748 20528637 20587420 20931535 21122058 21294239 21153532 21350842 21723263 21980299 22179539 21304485 15037557 15331561 15358012 15365284 7447225 6869206 3278578 7573053 8733139 9603935 10070677 10090111 15987729 16041375 16635802 16862161 17130513 16921578 17846126 18981327 11849460
23412934	A genome-wide association study of brain lesion distribution in multiple sclerosis.	Brain magnetic resonance imaging is widely used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool in multiple sclerosis and provides a non-invasive, sensitive and reproducible way to track the disease. Topological characteristics relating to the distribution and shape of lesions are recognized as important neuroradiological markers in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, although these have been much less well characterized quantitatively than have traditional measures such as T2 hyperintense or T1 hypointense lesion volumes. Here, we used voxel-level 3 T magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted scans to reconstruct the 3D topology of lesions in 284 subjects with multiple sclerosis and tested whether this is a heritable phenotype. To this end, we extracted the genotypes from a published genome-wide association study on these same individuals and searched for genetic associations with lesion load, shape and topological distribution. Lesion probability maps were created to identify frequently affected areas and to assess the overall distribution of T1 lesions in the subject population as a whole. We then developed an original algorithm to cluster adjacent lesional voxels (cluxels) in each subject and tested whether cluxel topology was significantly associated with any single-nucleotide polymorphism in our data set. To focus on patterns of lesion distribution, we computed the first 10 principal components. Although principal component 1 correlated with lesion load, none of the remaining orthogonal components correlated with any other known variable. We then conducted genome-wide association studies on each of these and found 31 significant associations (false discovery rate <0.01) with principal component 8, which represents a mode of variation of lesion topology in the population. The majority of the loci can be linked to genes related to immune cell function and to myelin and neural growth; some (SYK, MYT1L, TRAPPC9, SLITKR6 and RIC3) have been previously associated with the distribution of white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis. Finally, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify a network of 48 interacting proteins showing genetic associations (P < 0.01) with cluxel topology in multiple sclerosis. This network also contains proteins expressed in immune cells and is enriched in molecules expressed in the central nervous system that contribute to neural development and regeneration. Our results show how quantitative traits derived from brain magnetic resonance images of patients with multiple sclerosis can be used as dependent variables in a genome-wide association study. With the widespread availability of powerful computing and the availability of genotyped populations, integration of imaging and genetic data sets is likely to become a mainstream tool for understanding the complex biological processes of multiple sclerosis and other brain disorders.	 17878930 7682809 18334448 18488028 18940311 19010793 19022862 19123954 18412131 19065146 19305408 19286671 19451531 8265653 9066360 9373037 9786985 16607471 17015227 17354834 17330875 17701901 19394969 19634037 19542604 19798445 19340012 20004763 20004764 20107439 20303062 20558387 20585627 20686565 20802204 20100581 20171287 20369371 20881960 21085666 21436341 19727025 21497199 21465548 21621859 21710622 21710628 21833088 21798870 17640815 10802800 11456302 11467921 11744621 12169552 12372351 12454648 12880785 14550773 14643680 15048884 18186492
23406172	Genetic determinants of haemolysis in sickle cell anaemia.	Haemolytic anaemia is variable among patients with sickle cell anaemia and can be estimated by reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin levels. Using principal component analysis of these measurements we computed a haemolytic score that we used as a subphenotype in a genome-wide association study. We identified in one cohort and replicated in two additional cohorts the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in NPRL3 (rs7203560; chr16p13·3) (P = 6·04 × 10(-07) ). This association was validated by targeted genotyping in a fourth independent cohort. The HBA1/HBA2 regulatory elements, hypersensitive sites (HS)-33, HS-40 and HS-48 are located in introns of NPRL3. Rs7203560 was in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs9926112 (r(2)  = 1) and in strong LD with rs7197554 (r(2)  = 0·75) and rs13336641 (r(2)  = 0·77); the latter is located between HS-33 and HS-40 sites and next to a CTCF binding site. The minor allele for rs7203560 was associated with the -∝(3·7) thalassaemia gene deletion. When adjusting for HbF and ∝ thalassaemia, the association of NPRL3 with the haemolytic score was significant (P = 0·00375) and remained significant when examining only cases without gene deletion∝ thalassaemia (P = 0·02463). Perhaps by independently down-regulating expression of the HBA1/HBA2 genes, variants of the HBA1/HBA2 gene regulatory loci, tagged by rs7203560, reduce haemolysis in sickle cell anaemia.	 14990351 22983573 7114401 6866027 3533181 2231712 13575938 15297300 15811985 15998894 15998734 17084951 17701901 18461136 19211639 19563753 19699350 19649390 19862010 19724057 20139978 20018918 21264896 21490337 21527519 460443 10691858 11159318 12437670 12426562 22446184 22558097 22641479 22538705 22955828
23417110	Genome-wide association study identified the human leukocyte antigen region as a novel locus for plasma beta-2 microglobulin.	Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule and has been studied as a biomarker of kidney function, cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Little is known about the genes influencing its levels directly or through glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma B2M levels in 6738 European Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to identify novel loci for B2M and assessed its association with known estimated GFR (eGFR) loci. We identified 2 genome-wide significant loci. One was in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6 (lowest p value = 1.8 × 10(-23) for rs9264638). At this locus, 6 index SNPs accounted for 3.2 % of log(B2M) variance, and their association with B2M could largely be explained by imputed classical alleles of the MHC class I genes: HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C. The index SNPs at this locus were not associated with eGFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr). The other locus of B2M was on chromosome 12 (rs3184504 at SH2B3, beta = 0.02, p value = 3.1 × 10(-8)), which was previously implicated as an eGFR locus. In conclusion, although B2M is known to be a component of MHC class I molecule, the association between HLA class I alleles and plasma B2M levels in a community-based population is novel. The identification of the two novel loci for B2M extends our understanding of its metabolism and informs its use as a kidney filtration biomarker.	 11467650 16862161 19022533 2124002 11499557 21570397 21592391 9920013 22233601 4175239 2646917 22116452 10075613 21816777 22305758 22001567 11603614 19913121 21738647 22895515 20198709 18364390 18295055 21060863 20483451 20508602 2032286 2478461 18227369 20091798 22174698 12618477 11719489 19708985 20383146 10319267 19862010 20233392 17724262 22286218 19693089 6159213 19430483 19525953 20667078 21833088 18204446 4134761 19932544 21300701 21270831 2450918 21546482 15127324

23419831	APOE and BCHE as modulators of cerebral amyloid deposition: a florbetapir PET genome-wide association study.	Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the cerebral cortex is thought to be a pivotal event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis with a significant genetic contribution. Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cortical Aβ load until now. We employed florbetapir ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain Aβ levels in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were tested for association to quantitative global cortical Aβ load controlling for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein E) (rs429358, P=5.5 × 10(-14)) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P=2.7 × 10(-8)) in a region previously associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of the variance in cortical Aβ levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%). Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3, ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These results confirm the association of APOE with Aβ deposition and represent the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at the BCHE locus with Aβ burden in humans may have implications for potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD spectrum. 	 19595868 18974171 17486121 22637583 22487856 20142819 9302273 16682536 21715678 22820512 20451870 17917325 18391487 19634037 18339640 21651394 12563284 18640242 15297300 22749065 19713000 22476196 21471435 19679070 21852788 16801647 22157615 18334913 22786589 22504417 20451875 20080314 20538374 17701901 21862451 18348202 12684452 9403484 8346443 21245183 20451868 21514248 19359103 17903298
23423138	A common variant in myosin-18B contributes to mathematical abilities in children with dyslexia and intraparietal sulcus variability in adults.	The ability to perform mathematical tasks is required in everyday life. Although heritability estimates suggest a genetic contribution, no previous study has conclusively identified a genetic risk variant for mathematical performance. Research has shown that the prevalence of mathematical disabilities is increased in children with dyslexia. We therefore correlated genome-wide data of 200 German children with spelling disability, with available quantitative data on mathematic ability. Replication of the top findings in additional dyslexia samples revealed that rs133885 was a genome-wide significant marker for mathematical abilities (P(comb) = 7.71 × 10(-10), n = 699), with an effect size of 4.87%. This association was also found in a sample from the general population (P = 0.048, n = 1080), albeit with a lower effect size. The identified variant encodes an amino-acid substitution in MYO18B, a protein with as yet unknown functions in the brain. As areas of the parietal cortex, in particular the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), are involved in numerical processing in humans, we investigated whether rs133885 was associated with IPS morphology using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 79 neuropsychiatrically healthy adults. Carriers of the MYO18B risk-genotype displayed a significantly lower depth of the right IPS. This validates the identified association between rs133885 and mathematical disability at the level of a specific intermediate phenotype.	 15835906 17699676 18776888 18768777 11393049 20957581 12499305 14622587 15751041 15308213 18300295 18088583 20046827 12209013 21617068 17539369 19786962 20971676 11522573 10931772 17038000 7719130 18761673 11697933 12219807 17539370 22504417 11278198 20713499 17928237 17701901 10601743 19581563 16953876 10320379 19058223 21761997 9364899 19788550 19571811 10555134 20039944 3291116 16594732 17160900

23437003	Genetic determinants of trabecular and cortical volumetric bone mineral densities and bone microstructure.	Most previous genetic epidemiology studies within the field of osteoporosis have focused on the genetics of the complex trait areal bone mineral density (aBMD), not being able to differentiate genetic determinants of cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD), trabecular vBMD, and bone microstructural traits. The objective of this study was to separately identify genetic determinants of these bone traits as analysed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Separate GWA meta-analyses for cortical and trabecular vBMDs were performed. The cortical vBMD GWA meta-analysis (n = 5,878) followed by replication (n = 1,052) identified genetic variants in four separate loci reaching genome-wide significance (RANKL, rs1021188, p = 3.6×10⁻¹⁴; LOC285735, rs271170, p = 2.7×10⁻¹²; OPG, rs7839059, p = 1.2×10⁻¹⁰; and ESR1/C6orf97, rs6909279, p = 1.1×10⁻⁹). The trabecular vBMD GWA meta-analysis (n = 2,500) followed by replication (n = 1,022) identified one locus reaching genome-wide significance (FMN2/GREM2, rs9287237, p = 1.9×10⁻⁹). High-resolution pQCT analyses, giving information about bone microstructure, were available in a subset of the GOOD cohort (n = 729). rs1021188 was significantly associated with cortical porosity while rs9287237 was significantly associated with trabecular bone fraction. The genetic variant in the FMN2/GREM2 locus was associated with fracture risk in the MrOS Sweden cohort (HR per extra T allele 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.93) and GREM2 expression in human osteoblasts. In conclusion, five genetic loci associated with trabecular or cortical vBMD were identified. Two of these (FMN2/GREM2 and LOC285735) are novel bone-related loci, while the other three have previously been reported to be associated with aBMD. The genetic variants associated with cortical and trabecular bone parameters differed, underscoring the complexity of the genetics of bone parameters. We propose that a genetic variant in the RANKL locus influences cortical vBMD, at least partly, via effects on cortical porosity, and that a genetic variant in the FMN2/GREM2 locus influences GREM2 expression in osteoblasts and thereby trabecular number and thickness as well as fracture risk.	 16598372 20222106 17222801 17444815 17554300 17451375 17618849 17229586 18455228 18445777 18442308 18518773 18263651 19079262 19073177 19016581 19528961 19671655 19700477 19801982 19654370 20233392 20472174 19839766 19888900 19929437 20375214 20562875 20928874 21533022 21565789 21998597 22507743 22941192 20561906 21124946 21283786 20959961 10803674 10805804 10980570 11697792 12447394 13678771 14985946 15180950 8256786 8090165 9916782 15940376 16007330 22504420 22095490 22792071 21918900 17228994

23509613	Genome-wide association study of antiphospholipid antibodies.	Background. The persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) may lead to the development of primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Although the genetic basis of APA has been suggested, the identity of the underlying genes is largely unknown. In this study, we have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in an effort to identify susceptibility loci/genes for three main APA: anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL), lupus anticoagulant (LAC), and anti- β 2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti- β 2GPI). Methods. DNA samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array containing 906,600 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Association of SNPs with the antibody status (positive/negative) was tested using logistic regression under the additive model. Results. We have identified a number of suggestive novel loci with P < E - 05. Although they do not meet the conservative threshold of genome-wide significance, many of the suggestive loci are potential candidates for the production of APA. We have replicated the previously reported associations of HLA genes and APOH with APA but these were not the top loci. Conclusions. We have identified a number of suggestive novel loci for APA that will stimulate follow-up studies in independent and larger samples to replicate our findings.	 10990172 3668978 2499608 9063752 15527705 17492404 18711367 19048414 19713697 20331378 20164195 20431553 20460425 21303835 21123325 21486929 21412220 21903422 22225470 22239941 22247332 22246055
23446634	Genome-wide association analysis of red blood cell traits in African Americans: the COGENT Network.	Laboratory red blood cell (RBC) measurements are clinically important, heritable and differ among ethnic groups. To identify genetic variants that contribute to RBC phenotypes in African Americans (AAs), we conducted a genome-wide association study in up to ~16 500 AAs. The alpha-globin locus on chromosome 16pter [lead SNP rs13335629 in ITFG3 gene; P < 1E-13 for hemoglobin (Hgb), RBC count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), MCH and MCHC] and the G6PD locus on Xq28 [lead SNP rs1050828; P < 1E - 13 for Hgb, hematocrit (Hct), MCV, RBC count and red cell distribution width (RDW)] were each associated with multiple RBC traits. At the alpha-globin region, both the common African 3.7 kb deletion and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) appear to contribute independently to RBC phenotypes among AAs. In the 2p21 region, we identified a novel variant of PRKCE distinctly associated with Hct in AAs. In a genome-wide admixture mapping scan, local European ancestry at the 6p22 region containing HFE and LRRC16A was associated with higher Hgb. LRRC16A has been previously associated with the platelet count and mean platelet volume in AAs, but not with Hgb. Finally, we extended to AAs the findings of association of erythrocyte traits with several loci previously reported in Europeans and/or Asians, including CD164 and HBS1L-MYB. In summary, this large-scale genome-wide analysis in AAs has extended the importance of several RBC-associated genetic loci to AAs and identified allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy at several previously known genetic loci associated with blood cell traits in AAs.	 8449958 23222517 8696333 9096338 9220539 9570704 9680353 15790781 16030190 16166586 16493011 16627766 16773560 17077324 17569788 17978087 18348202 18603562 19152315 19066309 19344387 19820697 19862010 20040588 20139978 20927387 21031451 21153663 21738479 21765894 22075998 22423221 22929040 7949118

23453885	Identification of risk loci with shared effects on five major psychiatric disorders: a genome-wide analysis.	Findings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.	 14601036 8215813 22472876 22497794 22258521 17873874 17982457 18221348 18462017 18852200 19150704 18677311 18711365 19218893 19361613 19416921 19571811 20098439 20081856 20148275 20369019 19916019 20679588 20185149 20732625 20819988 19621016 20713499 20959621 20686188 21129726 20351715 21217634 21078305 21285140 21383967 21353194 20386566 20733578 21078228 21852963 21926972 21926974 22031444 22003227 22420048 22424231
23449627	Genome-wide association and longitudinal analyses reveal genetic loci linking pubertal height growth, pubertal timing and childhood adiposity.	The pubertal height growth spurt is a distinctive feature of childhood growth reflecting both the central onset of puberty and local growth factors. Although little is known about the underlying genetics, growth variability during puberty correlates with adult risks for hormone-dependent cancer and adverse cardiometabolic health. The only gene so far associated with pubertal height growth, LIN28B, pleiotropically influences childhood growth, puberty and cancer progression, pointing to shared underlying mechanisms. To discover genetic loci influencing pubertal height and growth and to place them in context of overall growth and maturation, we performed genome-wide association meta-analyses in 18 737 European samples utilizing longitudinally collected height measurements. We found significant associations (P < 1.67 × 10(-8)) at 10 loci, including LIN28B. Five loci associated with pubertal timing, all impacting multiple aspects of growth. In particular, a novel variant correlated with expression of MAPK3, and associated both with increased prepubertal growth and earlier menarche. Another variant near ADCY3-POMC associated with increased body mass index, reduced pubertal growth and earlier puberty. Whereas epidemiological correlations suggest that early puberty marks a pathway from rapid prepubertal growth to reduced final height and adult obesity, our study shows that individual loci associating with pubertal growth have variable longitudinal growth patterns that may differ from epidemiological observations. Overall, this study uncovers part of the complex genetic architecture linking pubertal height growth, the timing of puberty and childhood obesity and provides new information to pinpoint processes linking these traits.	 21058334 20935630 21470270 20922792 21179014 21505072 21798870 21881559 22174699 22291964 22338106 22484627 10709729 10909949 11201332 11158521 11875099 1275435 6682302 7913883 8078586 7670477 8760713 16170316 17384015 17572673 17478515 17701901 17921354 17645565 18320165 18203123 18293372 18784189 19633095 20041184 20130649 20233392 20372150 20398887 20714348 20881960 21102462
23406873	A genome-wide meta-analysis identifies two novel loci associated with high myopia in the Han Chinese population.	High myopia, highly prevalent in the Chinese population, is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Genetic factors play a critical role in the development of this visual disorder. Genome-wide association studies in recent years have revealed several chromosomal regions that contribute to its progression. To identify additional genetic variants for high myopia susceptibility, we used a genome-wide meta-analysis to examine the associations between the disease and 286 031 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a combined cohort of 665 cases and 960 controls. The most significant SNPs (n = 61) were genotyped in a replication cohort (850 cases and 1197 controls), and 14 SNPs were further tested through genotyping in two additional validation cohorts (combined 1278 cases and 2486 controls). As a result of this analysis, four SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P < 2.0 × 10(-7)). The most significantly associated SNP, rs2730260 [overall P = 8.95 × 10(-14); odds ratio (95% CI) =1.33 (1.23-1.44)], is located in the VIPR2 gene, which is located in the MYP4 locus. The other three SNPs (rs7839488, rs4395927 and rs4455882) in the same linkage disequilibrium block are located in the SNTB1 gene, with -P values ranging from 1.13 × 10(-8) to 2.13 × 10(-11). The VIPR2 and SNTB1 genes are expressed in the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium and have been previously reported to have potential functions for the pathogenesis of myopia. Our results suggest that variants of the VIPR2 and SNTB1 genes increase susceptibility to high myopia in Han Chinese.	
23533358	NCK2 is significantly associated with opiates addiction in African-origin men.	Substance dependence is a complex environmental and genetic disorder with significant social and medical concerns. Understanding the etiology of substance dependence is imperative to the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies. To this end, substantial effort has been made to identify genes underlying substance dependence, and in recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have led to discoveries of numerous genetic variants for complex diseases including substance dependence. Most of the GWAS discoveries were only based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a single dichotomized outcome. By employing both SNP- and gene-based methods of analysis, we identified a strong (odds ratio = 13.87) and significant (P value = 1.33E - 11) association of an SNP in the NCK2 gene on chromosome 2 with opiates addiction in African-origin men. Codependence analysis also identified a genome-wide significant association between NCK2 and comorbidity of substance dependence (P value = 3.65E - 08) in African-origin men. Furthermore, we observed that the association between the NCK2 gene (P value = 3.12E - 10) and opiates addiction reached the gene-based genome-wide significant level. In summary, our findings provided the first evidence for the involvement of NCK2 in the susceptibility to opiates addiction and further revealed the racial and gender specificities of its impact.	 19353632 15734726 15272419 8947252 17170166 16769879 17374033 21254220 17374032 10402507 14745296 22238607 9819065 18300295 22444669 11545662 18618000 17374034 19874574 20711441 23032486 21703634 16862602 19891732 15048645 16961766 20235792 18331377 17250611 15297300 20871796 23365539 20598278 20479774 21298047 9603606 18319328 18519826 17622222 19259974 20202923 19812666 17135278 17373729 10782012 17701901 16344719 17440936 17716221 15024690 15121434 18243582 16838244 18723748 21397060 19247474 12555233 18181266 18629733 15608558 21956439 20332099 16109452 17158188
23468962	A genome-wide scan for breast cancer risk haplotypes among African American women.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) simultaneously investigating hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have become a powerful tool in the investigation of new disease susceptibility loci. Haplotypes are sometimes thought to be superior to SNPs and are promising in genetic association analyses. The application of genome-wide haplotype analysis, however, is hindered by the complexity of haplotypes themselves and sophistication in computation. We systematically analyzed the haplotype effects for breast cancer risk among 5,761 African American women (3,016 cases and 2,745 controls) using a sliding window approach on the genome-wide scale. Three regions on chromosomes 1, 4 and 18 exhibited moderate haplotype effects. Furthermore, among 21 breast cancer susceptibility loci previously established in European populations, 10p15 and 14q24 are likely to harbor novel haplotype effects. We also proposed a heuristic of determining the significance level and the effective number of independent tests by the permutation analysis on chromosome 22 data. It suggests that the effective number was approximately half of the total (7,794 out of 15,645), thus the half number could serve as a quick reference to evaluating genome-wide significance if a similar sliding window approach of haplotype analysis is adopted in similar populations using similar genotype density.	 21102626 19789366 19474294 19865486 12605551 19434714 16945910 16862161 16845142 22976474 11988408 15780967 12452179 18273807 18425821 22430674 18358327 15637718 19198611 12615007 20018026 21169375 14566096 10729226 17934201 12029063 7612904 16077740 19735491 21124933 21104886 15217505 15297300 19092774 16025443 21852243 7476138 15266393 12037407 9837836 12384975 19367585 18622428 21614091 11788962 19543370 18577746 16774684 15543638 17847013 17701901 19680443 11346797 22954633 17886257 11189684 18701435 11791212 20981092 12796855 22644746 22923054 11586305 14639705 15148658 11678987 11721056 10695593
23281178	A genome-wide assessment of variability in human serum metabolism.	The study of the genetic regulation of metabolism in human serum samples can contribute to a better understanding of the intermediate biological steps that lead from polymorphism to disease. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) utilizing samples from a study of prostate cancer in Swedish men, consisting of 402 individuals (214 cases and 188 controls) in a discovery set and 489 case-only samples in a replication set. A global nontargeted metabolite profiling approach was utilized resulting in the detection of 6,138 molecular features followed by targeted identification of associated metabolites. Seven replicating loci were identified (PYROXD2, FADS1, PON1, CYP4F2, UGT1A8, ACADL, and LIPC) with associated sequence variants contributing significantly to trait variance for one or more metabolites (P = 10(-13) -10(-91)). Regional mQTL enrichment analyses implicated two loci that included FADS1 and a novel locus near PDGFC. Biological pathway analysis implicated ACADM, ACADS, ACAD8, ACAD10, ACAD11, and ACOXL, reflecting significant enrichment of genes with acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. mQTL SNPs and mQTL-harboring genes were over-represented across GWASs conducted to date, suggesting that these data may have utility in tracing the molecular basis of some complex disease associations.	
23456092	Extended genetic effects of ADH cluster genes on the risk of alcohol dependence: from GWAS to replication.	Alcohol dependence (AD) is a multifactorial and polygenic disorder involving complex gene-to-gene and gene-to-environment interactions. Several genome-wide association studies have reported numerous risk factors for AD, but replication results following these studies have been controversial. To identify new candidate genes, the present study used GWAS and replication studies in a Korean cohort with AD. Genome-wide association analysis revealed that two chromosome regions on Chr. 4q22-q23 (ADH gene cluster, including ADH5, ADH4, ADH6, ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH7) and Chr. 12q24 (ALDH2) showed multiple association signals for the risk of AD. To investigate detailed genetic effects of these ADH genes on AD, a follow-up study of the ADH gene cluster on 4q22-q23 was performed. A total of 90 SNPs, including ADH1B rs1229984 (H47R), were genotyped in an additional 975 Korean subjects. In case-control analysis, ADH1B rs1229984 (H47R) showed the most significant association with the risk of AD (p = 2.63 × 10(-21), OR = 2.35). Moreover, subsequent conditional analyses revealed that all positive associations of other ADH genes in the cluster disappeared, which suggested that ADH1B rs1229984 (H47R) might be the sole functional genetic marker across the ADH gene cluster. Our findings could provide additional information on the ADH gene cluster regarding the risk of AD, as well as a new and important insight into the genetic factors associated with AD.	 8166312 16938546 21372407 9347089 18307984 17847010 21576033 17273965 12050823 17718394 20201924 17921519 2014795 7925371 15564879 10441588 16571603 15297300 12452180 9892295 16086315 11198709 20202923 18056758 17923853 11858627 8651462 18839109 1404711 2054065 22004471 16220108 9040286 11254454 8974313 21270382 20089146 19861527 22096494 10090900
23314186	Genetic variation associated with circulating monocyte count in the eMERGE Network.	With white blood cell count emerging as an important risk factor for chronic inflammatory diseases, genetic associations of differential leukocyte types, specifically monocyte count, are providing novel candidate genes and pathways to further investigate. Circulating monocytes play a critical role in vascular diseases such as in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. We performed a joint and ancestry-stratified genome-wide association analyses to identify variants specifically associated with monocyte count in 11 014 subjects in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. In the joint and European ancestry samples, we identified novel associations in the chromosome 16 interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) gene (P-value = 2.78×10(-16), β = -0.22). Other monocyte associations include novel missense variants in the chemokine-binding protein 2 (CCBP2) gene (P-value = 1.88×10(-7), β = 0.30) and a region of replication found in ribophorin I (RPN1) (P-value = 2.63×10(-16), β = -0.23) on chromosome 3. The CCBP2 and RPN1 region is located near GATA binding protein2 gene that has been previously shown to be associated with coronary heart disease. On chromosome 9, we found a novel association in the prostaglandin reductase 1 gene (P-value = 2.29×10(-7), β = 0.16), which is downstream from lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. This region has previously been shown to be associated with monocyte count. We also replicated monocyte associations of genome-wide significance (P-value = 5.68×10(-17), β = -0.23) at the integrin, alpha 4 gene on chromosome 2. The novel IRF8 results and further replications provide supporting evidence of genetic regions associated with monocyte count.	 10572090 22037903 12045153 12133947 17502370 17701901 18179887 18500243 20040767 21269473 21738478 21738479 21738480 21524210 21598361 22025056 11846985
23455637	A variant in FTO shows association with melanoma risk not due to BMI.	We report the results of an association study of melanoma that is based on the genome-wide imputation of the genotypes of 1,353 cases and 3,566 controls of European origin conducted by the GenoMEL consortium. This revealed an association between several SNPs in intron 8 of the FTO gene, including rs16953002, which replicated using 12,313 cases and 55,667 controls of European ancestry from Europe, the USA and Australia (combined P = 3.6 × 10(-12), per-allele odds ratio for allele A = 1.16). In addition to identifying a new melanoma-susceptibility locus, this is to our knowledge the first study to identify and replicate an association with SNPs in FTO not related to body mass index (BMI). These SNPs are not in intron 1 (the BMI-related region) and exhibit no association with BMI. This suggests FTO's function may be broader than the existing paradigm that FTO variants influence multiple traits only through their associations with BMI and obesity.	 7741122 19578364 8664138 15761869 16029848 17434869 12111919 12584178 3802833 1869281 17496892 17463248 17463249 17554300 17572673 18280327 17658951 18372903 18488026 18488027 18792098 19214238 19543373 19559399 19542184 20031593 20362563 20581827 20647408 20634204 20935630 21098976 21347432 21084183 21398525 21983787 22012259 22080950 21788373 22109280 22450736 22763110 22955986 22955989 22531089 7741123
23456168	Genome-wide association study in Han Chinese identifies three novel loci for human height.	Human height is a complex genetic trait with high heritability but discovery efforts in Asian populations are limited. We carried out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for height in 6,534 subjects with in silico replication of 1,881 subjects in Han Chinese. We identified three novel loci reaching the genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10(-8)), which mapped in or near ZNF638 (rs12612930, P = 2.02 × 10(-10)), MAML2 (rs11021504, P = 7.81 × 10(-9)), and C18orf12 (rs11082671, P = 1.87 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed two loci previously reported in European populations including CS (rs3816804, P = 2.63 × 10(-9)) and CYP19A1 (rs3751599, P = 4.80 × 10(-10)). In addition, we provided evidence supporting 35 SNPs identified by previous GWAS (P < 0.05). Our study provides new insights into the genetic determination of biological regulation of human height.	 22751097 11315092 22298955 20189936 16862161 18193045 20397748 20668459 21552263 18297083 19034521 19729412 18391950 19715440 7789282 20881960 11549641 21602272 14624724 19030899 19893584 20616382 18952825 18950892 12386158 17767157 19140131 19570815 21058334 20966902 19590010 19812666 15132212 17701901 18391952 20040588 19396169 22021425 15470266 22354840 17443206
23455636	Seven new loci associated with age-related macular degeneration.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of blindness in older individuals. To accelerate the understanding of AMD biology and help design new therapies, we executed a collaborative genome-wide association study, including >17,100 advanced AMD cases and >60,000 controls of European and Asian ancestry. We identified 19 loci associated at P < 5 × 10(-8). These loci show enrichment for genes involved in the regulation of complement activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Our results include seven loci with associations reaching P < 5 × 10(-8) for the first time, near the genes COL8A1-FILIP1L, IER3-DDR1, SLC16A8, TGFBR1, RAD51B, ADAMTS9 and B3GALTL. A genetic risk score combining SNP genotypes from all loci showed similar ability to distinguish cases and controls in all samples examined. Our findings provide new directions for biological, genetic and therapeutic studies of AMD.	 18685559 17767156 19215730 19264985 19474294 19405847 18511946 19715440 19812666 19966805 20233392 20354512 20360734 20385819 20385826 20360305 20616382 20811451 20634204 20601685 20981092 20843825 21058334 21122828 21374718 21665990 21909106 22022419 21959373 21882290 22019782 22162623 22513993 23128226 18398418 11315092 12958120 14997420 15078675 3719049 9512153 9634502 15767473 15761120 15761121 15761122 15870199 16080115 16174643 16199517 16415888 16518403 16936732 16936733 16998489 17053108 17456821 17572673 17634448 17701901 19200528
23459936	Exploring the genetic basis of chronic periodontitis: a genome-wide association study.	Chronic periodontitis (CP) is a common oral disease that confers substantial systemic inflammatory and microbial burden and is a major cause of tooth loss. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study of CP that was carried out in a cohort of 4504 European Americans (EA) participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (mean age-62 years, moderate CP-43% and severe CP-17%). We detected no genome-wide significant association signals for CP; however, we found suggestive evidence of association (P < 5 × 10(-6)) for six loci, including NIN, NPY, WNT5A for severe CP and NCR2, EMR1, 10p15 for moderate CP. Three of these loci had concordant effect size and direction in an independent sample of 656 adult EA participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study. Meta-analysis pooled estimates were severe CP (n = 958 versus health: n = 1909)-NPY, rs2521634 [G]: odds ratio [OR = 1.49 (95% confidence interval (CI = 1.28-1.73, P = 3.5 × 10(-7)))]; moderate CP (n = 2293)-NCR2, rs7762544 [G]: OR = 1.40 (95% CI = 1.24-1.59, P = 7.5 × 10(-8)), EMR1, rs3826782 [A]: OR = 2.01 (95% CI = 1.52-2.65, P = 8.2 × 10(-7)). Canonical pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment of nervous system signaling, cellular immune response and cytokine signaling pathways. A significant interaction of NUAK1 (rs11112872, interaction P = 2.9 × 10(-9)) with smoking in ARIC was not replicated in Health ABC, although estimates of heritable variance in severe CP explained by all single nucleotide polymorphisms increased from 18 to 52% with the inclusion of a genome-wide interaction term with smoking. These genome-wide association results provide information on multiple candidate regions and pathways for interrogation in future genetic studies of CP.	 2072240 8032453 11128917 16862161 20562875 3487557 6936406 10993575 19214202 22093052 2646917 17608611 15059944 21501239 22253303 12668349 22699663 21709707 15066069 20616382 21964901 20354512 15780750 11701471 19010457 22133366 10048646 16277589 21471325 20233392 11063384 15699278 19897590 9722697 21254218 22360496 21058334 16702416 19812666 16411989 9705695 20634204 10872955 21594894 17701901 20074509 19961380 21134227 18256235 18062113 22735581 21167468 21043800 22348697 11394403 20514045 16332229
23463857	Genome- and phenome-wide analyses of cardiac conduction identifies markers of arrhythmia risk.

23472185	Oligoclonal band status in Scandinavian multiple sclerosis patients is associated with specific genetic risk alleles.	The presence of oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a typical finding in multiple sclerosis (MS). We applied data from Norwegian, Swedish and Danish (i.e. Scandinavian) MS patients from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for genetic differences in MS relating to OCB status. GWAS data was compared in 1367 OCB positive and 161 OCB negative Scandinavian MS patients, and nine of the most associated SNPs were genotyped for replication in 3403 Scandinavian MS patients. HLA-DRB1 genotypes were analyzed in a subset of the OCB positive (n = 2781) and OCB negative (n = 292) MS patients and compared to 890 healthy controls. Results from the genome-wide analyses showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the HLA complex and six other loci were associated to OCB status. In SNPs selected for replication, combined analyses showed genome-wide significant association for two SNPs in the HLA complex; rs3129871 (p = 5.7×10(-15)) and rs3817963 (p = 5.7×10(-10)) correlating with the HLA-DRB1*15 and the HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, respectively. We also found suggestive association to one SNP in the Calsyntenin-2 gene (p = 8.83×10(-7)). In HLA-DRB1 analyses HLA-DRB1*15∶01 was a stronger risk factor for OCB positive than OCB negative MS, whereas HLA-DRB1*04∶04 was associated with increased risk of OCB negative MS and reduced risk of OCB positive MS. Protective effects of HLA-DRB1*01∶01 and HLA-DRB1*07∶01 were detected in both groups. The groups were different with regard to age at onset (AAO), MS outcome measures and gender. This study confirms both shared and distinct genetic risk for MS subtypes in the Scandinavian population defined by OCB status and indicates different clinical characteristics between the groups. This suggests differences in disease mechanisms between OCB negative and OCB positive MS with implications for patient management, which need to be further studied.	 6847134 4113225 9328791 15930013 16473370 16905561 17000979 17053149 16945427 17564960 17701901 17660530 18382088 18970977 18829628 19181345 19324977 19327846 19457560 19630074 19720976 19879597 20534645 20678810 20959295 21387374 21440682 21833088 21418440 22112985 21643791 22185806 23225573 22961214 11456302 11741834 12498782 12601107 14989713 15081263 15104673 8057110
23459443	Drug-gene interactions and the search for missing heritability: a cross-sectional pharmacogenomics study of the QT interval.	Variability in response to drug use is common and heritable, suggesting that genome-wide pharmacogenomics studies may help explain the 'missing heritability' of complex traits. Here, we describe four independent analyses in 33 781 participants of European ancestry from 10 cohorts that were designed to identify genetic variants modifying the effects of drugs on QT interval duration (QT). Each analysis cross-sectionally examined four therapeutic classes: thiazide diuretics (prevalence of use=13.0%), tri/tetracyclic antidepressants (2.6%), sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents (2.9%) and QT-prolonging drugs as classified by the University of Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (4.4%). Drug-gene interactions were estimated using covariable-adjusted linear regression and results were combined with fixed-effects meta-analysis. Although drug-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions were biologically plausible and variables were well-measured, findings from the four cross-sectional meta-analyses were null (Pinteraction>5.0 × 10(-8)). Simulations suggested that additional efforts, including longitudinal modeling to increase statistical power, are likely needed to identify potentially important pharmacogenomic effects. 	 22682551 18521091 11315092 12571261 19247217 8604626 17384015 8184870 20031568 20854747 2919564 22025428 19749758 20921969 21771992 8004131 20519034 19587794 7736582 18535201 4926376 19089453 17676998 18650507 14999113 20173735 19749757 20616382 20062061 15851319 22100668 8401129 10597863 16648850 19491196 3880997 14975464 20233392 15591335 15892024 21058334 20300088 20031603 11710893 10201655 19812666 19305409 10073515 21502584 19684573 20040588 12690008 11741220 19305408 20693352 21709561 19300499 15345781
23472165	Genome-wide association study link novel loci to endometriosis.	Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition with complex etiology defined by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the womb. Endometriosis is a common cause of both cyclic and chronic pelvic pain, reduced fertility, and reduced quality-of-life. Diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis is, on average, delayed by 7-10 years from the onset of symptoms. Absence of a timely and non-invasive diagnostic tool is presently the greatest barrier to the identification and treatment of endometriosis. Twin and family studies have documented an increased relative risk in families. To identify genetic factors that contribute to endometriosis we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a European cohort including 2,019 surgically confirmed endometriosis cases and 14,471 controls. Three of the SNPs we identify associated at P<5×10(-8) in our combined analysis belong to two loci: LINC00339-WNT4 on 1p36.12 (rs2235529; P = 8.65×10(-9), OR = 1.29, CI = 1.18-1.40) and RND3-RBM43 on 2q23.3 (rs1519761; P = 4.70×10(-8), OR = 1.20, Cl = 1.13-1.29, and rs6757804; P = 4.05×10(-8), OR = 1.20, Cl = 1.13-1.29). Using an adjusted Bonferoni significance threshold of 4.51×10(-7) we identify two additional loci in our meta-analysis that associate with endometriosis:, RNF144B-ID4 on 6p22.3 (rs6907340; P = 2.19×10(-7), OR = 1.20, Cl = 1.12-1.28), and HNRNPA3P1-LOC100130539 on 10q11.21 (rs10508881; P = 4.08×10(-7), OR = 1.19, Cl = 1.11-1.27). Consistent with previously suggested associations to WNT4 our study implicate a 150 kb region around WNT4 that also include LINC00339 and CDC42. A univariate analysis of documented infertility, age at menarche, and family history did not show allelic association with these SNP markers. Clinical data from patients in our study reveal an average delay in diagnosis of 8.4 years and confirm a strong correlation between endometriosis severity and infertility (n = 1182, P<0.001, OR = 2.18). This GWAS of endometriosis was conducted with high diagnostic certainty in cases, and with stringent handling of population substructure. Our findings broaden the understanding of the genetic factors that play a role in endometriosis.	 20436317 16862161 19687804 15541453 23010532 16080113 18535005 17070183 22587998 18760391 23104006 16249290 12660267 21163860 12790847 22924156 19358700 21151130 20601957 9389831 17701901 9130884 8304029 19648217 11870102 22307873 16854417 19543373 10202882
23471985	Genome-wide scan of healthy human connectome discovers SPON1 gene variant influencing dementia severity.	Aberrant connectivity is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, other than a few disease-associated candidate genes, we know little about the degree to which genetics play a role in the brain networks; we know even less about specific genes that influence brain connections. Twin and family-based studies can generate estimates of overall genetic influences on a trait, but genome-wide association scans (GWASs) can screen the genome for specific variants influencing the brain or risk for disease. To identify the heritability of various brain connections, we scanned healthy young adult twins with high-field, high-angular resolution diffusion MRI. We adapted GWASs to screen the brain's connectivity pattern, allowing us to discover genetic variants that affect the human brain's wiring. The association of connectivity with the SPON1 variant at rs2618516 on chromosome 11 (11p15.2) reached connectome-wide, genome-wide significance after stringent statistical corrections were enforced, and it was replicated in an independent subsample. rs2618516 was shown to affect brain structure in an elderly population with varying degrees of dementia. Older people who carried the connectivity variant had significantly milder clinical dementia scores and lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. As a posthoc analysis, we conducted GWASs on several organizational and topological network measures derived from the matrices to discover variants in and around genes associated with autism (MACROD2), development (NEDD4), and mental retardation (UBE2A) significantly associated with connectivity. Connectome-wide, genome-wide screening offers substantial promise to discover genes affecting brain connectivity and risk for brain diseases.	 20016769 17021177 1555244 22461612 22863679 20412111 19434714 22504421 20688814 16120771 20111993 11694885 22848712 22049421 16300627 22819192 18554321 20829489 20197096 22654059 15190254 21410935 18003904 1759558 19819337 16530430 12139432 18691658 9191756 16443497 22711833 20598278 14675724 21741401 21368038 18271029 17825583 20133824 20391539 22504417 22504419 20581818 20663923 21543606 11287656 22562816 23262292 12574429 7104545 11113031 22461613 22504418 20122755 19060910 19211893 10399931 14983046 20208533

23474815	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in five cohorts reveals common variants in RBFOX1, a regulator of tissue-specific splicing, associated with refractive error.	Visual refractive errors (REs) are complex genetic traits with a largely unknown etiology. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of moderate size have identified several novel risk markers for RE, measured here as mean spherical equivalent (MSE). We performed a GWAS using a total of 7280 samples from five cohorts: the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS); the KORA study ('Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg'); the Framingham Eye Study (FES); the Ogliastra Genetic Park-Talana (OGP-Talana) Study and the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Genotyping was performed on Illumina and Affymetrix platforms with additional markers imputed to the HapMap II reference panel. We identified a new genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 16 (rs10500355, P = 3.9 × 10(-9)) in a combined discovery and replication set (26 953 samples). This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located within the RBFOX1 gene which is a neuron-specific splicing factor regulating a wide range of alternative splicing events implicated in neuronal development and maturation, including transcription factors, other splicing factors and synaptic proteins.	 10592272 22685421 11211020 11328732 11709020 11734523 12045153 12160524 14685227 14985292 15008558 15078680 15148587 15555525 15590941 15611866 15824060 15851555 16862161 17065484 17327828 17572673 17194218 17701901 17724179 17503474 18193043 18193045 18648525 18294691 18469186 18769560 18794351 19064856 19433716 19471602 19211608 19779542 20005573 20208533 20718045 20835236 20835239 21095009 21155761 21655358 21640322 21614001 21505071 21695231 21714144 21623373 22665138 22730494 15215395 22051799 10868275
23470693	Genome-wide association studies of pit-and-fissure- and smooth-surface caries in permanent dentition.	While genetics clearly influences dental caries risk, few caries genes have been discovered and validated. Recent studies have suggested differential genetic factors for primary dentition caries and permanent dentition caries, as well as for pit-and-fissure- (PF) and smooth- (SM) surface caries. We performed separate GWAS for caries in permanent-dentition PF surfaces (1,017 participants, adjusted for age, sex, and the presence of Streptococcus mutans) and SM surfaces (1,004 participants, adjusted for age, education group, and the presence of Streptococcus mutans) in self-reported whites (ages 14 to 56 yrs). Caries scores were derived based on visual assessment of each surface of each tooth; more than 1.2 million SNPs were either successfully genotyped or imputed and were tested for association. Two homologous genes were suggestively associated: BCOR (Xp11.4) in PF-surface caries (p value = 1.8E-7), and BCORL1 (Xq26.1) in SM-surface caries (p value = 1.0E-5). BCOR mutations cause oculofaciocardiodental syndrome, a Mendelian disease involving multiple dental anomalies. Associations of other plausible cariogenesis genes were also observed for PF-surface caries (e.g., INHBA, p value = 6.5E-6) and for SM-surface caries (e.g., CXCR1 and CXCR2, p value = 1.9E-6). This study supports the notion that genes differentially affect cariogenesis across the surfaces of the permanent dentition, and nominates several novel genes for investigation.	 20070156 22405185 10932194 11714685 18795143 10468466 17956471 20652339 9207855 20718045 9716414 9775475 15957158 21940522 16246939 10069716 16121123 12412952 16788889 20563598 17344103 15004558 17379597 3063664 22286298 20516689 18434572 19367324 15511295 19578371
23536807	A genome-wide association study for primary open angle glaucoma and macular degeneration reveals novel Loci.	Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are the two leading causes of visual loss in the United States. We utilized a novel study design to perform a genome-wide association for both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and AMD. This study design utilized a two-stage process for hypothesis generation and validation, in which each disease cohort was utilized as a control for the other. A total of 400 POAG patients and 400 AMD patients were ascertained and genotyped at 500,000 loci. This study identified a novel association of complement component 7 (C7) to POAG. Additionally, an association of central corneal thickness, a known risk factor for POAG, was found to be associated with ribophorin II (RPN2). Linked monogenic loci for POAG and AMD were also evaluated for evidence of association, none of which were found to be significantly associated. However, several yielded putative associations requiring validation. Our data suggest that POAG is more genetically complex than AMD, with no common risk alleles of large effect.	 19361779 19625618 19765683 19235185 20022638 20215012 20363506 20835238 20576771 21398277 21562585 21427129 21447600 21532571 21508110 2690818 21873608 22156576 22306015 22570617 22661486 22798626 10802651 11097601 11594942 11834836 12049575 14597044 14685227 15108121 15269314 6349332 2813076 8513321 8586416 8812425 8842741 8944018 9005853 9012402 9097971 9497264 9620769 9683145 9780093 10037570 10196380 10326953 15677485 15761120 15761121 15761122 15870199 15914615 15895326 15906098 16080115 16124852 16174643 16267090 16505037 16518403 16723468 16677633 16872346 16876519 16998489 17053108 17053109 17122119 17353431 17317787 17554300 17563728 17634448 17690259 17884985 17999355 18083105 18541031 18572163 18776954 18586872 18842294 18685559 19000712
23478653	A genome-wide association study of survival in small-cell lung cancer patients treated with irinotecan plus cisplatin chemotherapy.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing overall survival (OS) of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. We prospectively collected blood samples from 139 SCLC patients who participated in phase II studies of irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) chemotherapy as first-line therapy. Among 334 127 SNPs, which passed quality control, seven showed significant association with OS. The rs16950650CT, rs7186128AG or GG, rs17574269AG, rs8020368CC, rs4655567CC, rs2166219TT or rs2018683TT showed shorter OS compared with control alleles. Among the seven SNPs, rs4655567, rs8020368 and rs2018683 were significantly associated with a resistant relapse (RR). In the multivariate analysis, rs8020368CC was significantly associated with higher risk of RR (odds ratio=16.7, P=0.007). In vitro and in silico analysis showed that SNPs in C14orf49 might be associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This exploratory GWAS identified candidate SNPs that may be predictive of the clinical outcome of SCLC patients receiving IP.

23561647	Genome-wide association study of coronary and aortic calcification implicates risk loci for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.	Arterial calcification is a well-known risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). We performed a genome-wide association study on coronary artery calcification and aortic calcification as intermediate traits for CAD/MI. We tested ∼2.5 million SNPs for association with coronary artery calcification and aortic calcification in 2620 male individuals of the NELSON trial, who underwent chest CT scans. All participants were current or former heavy smokers. No SNPs were associated with aortic calcification on a genome-wide scale. The 9p21 locus was significantly associated with coronary artery calcification (rs1537370, P = 2.3 × 10(-11)). Since this locus corresponds to the strongest SNP association for CAD/MI, we tested 24 published and validated CAD/MI risk SNPs for association with arterial calcification. Besides the CAD/MI SNP at 9p21 (rs4977574, P = 3.1 × 10(-10)), two additional loci at ADAMTS7 (rs3825807, P = 6.5 × 10(-6)) and at PHACTR1 (rs12526453, P = 1.0 × 10(-3)) show a nominally significant association with coronary artery calcification with MI/CAD risk alleles increasing the degree of arterial calcification. The 9p21 locus was also nominally associated with aortic calcification (P = 3.2 × 10(-4)). These findings indicate that these CAD and MI risk loci are likely involved in arterial calcification.

23502781	Genome-wide association analysis identifies a susceptibility locus for pulmonary arterial hypertension.	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe disease resulting from progressive obliteration of small-caliber pulmonary arteries by proliferating vascular cells. PAH can occur without recognized etiology (idiopathic PAH), be associated with a systemic disease or occur as a heritable form, with BMPR2 mutated in approximately 80% of familial and 15% of idiopathic PAH cases. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on 2 independent case-control studies for idiopathic and familial PAH (without BMPR2 mutations), including a total of 625 cases and 1,525 healthy individuals. We detected a significant association at the CBLN2 locus mapping to 18q22.3, with the risk allele conferring an odds ratio for PAH of 1.97 (1.59-2.45; P = 7.47 × 10(-10)). CBLN2 is expressed in the lung, and its expression is higher in explanted lungs from individuals with PAH and in endothelial cells cultured from explanted PAH lungs.	 21410790 15289382 11315092 18356561 16862161 6703480 19555858 15249493 21651515 8988890 2760624 21471108 21037114 19679640 14598854 16415888 21378990 19926856 15939821 21460840 21980494 13655060 16930405 21084426 17701901 20534176 9423247 16456139 18596905 21750679 15721752
23502783	The CCND1 c.870G>A polymorphism is a risk factor for t(11;14)(q13;q32) multiple myeloma.	A number of specific chromosomal abnormalities define the subgroups of multiple myeloma. In a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies of multiple myeloma including a total of 1,661 affected individuals, we investigated risk for developing a specific tumor karyotype. The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in which CCND1 is placed under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer was strongly associated with the CCND1 c.870G>A polymorphism (P = 7.96 × 10(-11)). These results provide a model in which a constitutive genetic factor is associated with risk of a specific chromosomal translocation.	 22532805 21654808 21261519 16862161 12111919 14989251 21085122 22495321 22560090 20940415 20087644 21304890 12177636 21131037 17289997 12029063 18843022 16362079 22315488 16705090 22120009 16826223 21219174 16155052 19644074 18180298 16550162 18070707 17499716 21356186 20459741 20220069 16224025 20940395
23508960	Aspirin hydrolysis in plasma is a variable function of butyrylcholinesterase and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b2 (PAFAH1b2).	Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed within erythrocytes by a heterodimer of PAFAH1b2/PAFAH1b3 but also in plasma by an unidentified activity. Hydrolysis in both compartments was variable, with a 12-fold variation in plasma among 2226 Cleveland Clinic GeneBank patients. Platelet inhibition by aspirin was suppressed in plasma that rapidly hydrolyzed aspirin. Plasma aspirin hydrolysis was significantly higher in patients with coronary artery disease compared with control subjects (16.5 ± 4.4 versus 15.1 ± 3.7 nmol/ml/min; p = 3.4 × 10(-8)). A genome-wide association study of 2054 GeneBank subjects identified a single locus immediately adjacent to the BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) gene associated with plasma aspirin hydrolytic activity (lead SNP, rs6445035; p = 9.1 × 10(-17)). However, its penetrance was low, and plasma from an individual with an inactivating mutation in BCHE still effectively hydrolyzed aspirin. A second aspirin hydrolase was identified in plasma, the purification of which showed it to be homomeric PAFAH1b2. This is distinct from the erythrocyte PAFAH1b2/PAFAH1b3 heterodimer. Inhibitors showed that both butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and PAFAH1b2 contribute to aspirin hydrolysis in plasma, with variation primarily reflecting non-genetic variation of BChE activity. Therefore, aspirin is hydrolyzed in plasma by two enzymes, BChE and a new extracellular form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, PAFAH1b2. Hydrolytic effectiveness varies widely primarily from non-genetic variation of BChE activity that affects aspirin bioavailability in blood and the ability of aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation.	 5013373 22075249 810797 19482214 5891911 19232899 6712756 9748494 21170047 10542206 1613122 17574104 23212718 8424287 15860386 10715270 20659351 14671242 3443144 7974569 21293878 9660828 2144687 16793048 3888490 15098021 8985254 3103135 19232900 13650640 18024618 12551946 6436696 15025799 21475195 17180149 12374850 21844189 10421450 20879632 16442234 18349088 9259670 14695884 1892057 2339692 8446967 8565784
23496005	Clinical, polysomnographic and genome-wide association analyses of narcolepsy with cataplexy: a European Narcolepsy Network study.	The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and PSG characteristics of narcolepsy with cataplexy and their genetic predisposition by using the retrospective patient database of the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN). We have analysed retrospective data of 1099 patients with narcolepsy diagnosed according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2. Demographic and clinical characteristics, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test data, hypocretin-1 levels, and genome-wide genotypes were available. We found a significantly lower age at sleepiness onset (men versus women: 23.74 ± 12.43 versus 21.49 ± 11.83, P = 0.003) and longer diagnostic delay in women (men versus women: 13.82 ± 13.79 versus 15.62 ± 14.94, P = 0.044). The mean diagnostic delay was 14.63 ± 14.31 years, and longer delay was associated with higher body mass index. The best predictors of short diagnostic delay were young age at diagnosis, cataplexy as the first symptom and higher frequency of cataplexy attacks. The mean multiple sleep latency negatively correlated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and with the number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs), but none of the polysomnographic variables was associated with subjective or objective measures of sleepiness. Variant rs2859998 in UBXN2B gene showed a strong association (P = 1.28E-07) with the age at onset of excessive daytime sleepiness, and rs12425451 near the transcription factor TEAD4 (P = 1.97E-07) with the age at onset of cataplexy. Altogether, our results indicate that the diagnostic delay remains extremely long, age and gender substantially affect symptoms, and that a genetic predisposition affects the age at onset of symptoms. 	
23508266	A genome-wide association study of bronchodilator response in asthmatics.	Reversibility of airway obstruction in response to β2-agonists is highly variable among asthmatics, which is partially attributed to genetic factors. In a genome-wide association study of acute bronchodilator response (BDR) to inhaled albuterol, 534 290 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in 403 white trios from the Childhood Asthma Management Program using five statistical models to determine the most robust genetic associations. The primary replication phase included 1397 polymorphisms in three asthma trials (pooled n=764). The second replication phase tested 13 SNPs in three additional asthma populations (n=241, n=215 and n=592). An intergenic SNP on chromosome 10, rs11252394, proximal to several excellent biological candidates, significantly replicated (P=1.98 × 10(-7)) in the primary replication trials. An intronic SNP (rs6988229) in the collagen (COL22A1) locus also provided strong replication signals (P=8.51 × 10(-6)). This study applied a robust approach for testing the genetic basis of BDR and identified novel loci associated with this drug response in asthmatics. 	 11027739 22792082 11359637 12032351 12151001 12359648 12824425 14597484 14740322 15080825 15500895 7466721 2749657 8290741 7915137 9399966 10027502 10340917 15715182 15843549 15879435 16147906 16255080 16729719 16750985 16998094 17415415 17507702 17561245 17517770 17637349 17701901 17956269 18193043 18362331 18408560 18569231 18467348 18641329 17852344 18617639 18783200 19426955 21211649 21849067 11230178

Venous Thrombosis (VT) is a common multifactorial disease with an estimated heritability between 35% and 60%.

This study was aimed to investigate whether pair-wise interactions between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could exist and modulate the risk of VT.	 18974171 10209995 12814979 21810271 22618535 22340074 17308338 19198611 19912223 19434077 11867360 17677000 22714933 14598854 21441561 15557412 22496670 20479774 11038326 21980494 19812666 13655060 19132190 22703881 17701901 21781262 22443383 19278955 17634969
23518928	TSPYL5 SNPs: association with plasma estradiol concentrations and aromatase expression.	We performed a discovery genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with variation in plasma estradiol (E2) concentrations using DNA from 772 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer prior to the initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy. Association analyses showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1864729) with the lowest P value (P = 3.49E-08), mapped to chromosome 8 near TSPYL5. We also identified 17 imputed SNPs in or near TSPYL5 with P values < 5E-08, one of which, rs2583506, created a functional estrogen response element. We then used a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) stably transfected with ERα with known genome-wide SNP genotypes to demonstrate that TSPYL5 expression increased after E2 exposure of cells heterozygous for variant TSPYL5 SNP genotypes, but not in those homozygous for wild-type alleles. TSPYL5 knockdown decreased, and overexpression increased aromatase (CYP19A1) expression in MCF-7 cells, LCLs, and adipocytes through the skin/adipose (I.4) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that TSPYL5 bound to the CYP19A1 I.4 promoter. A putative TSPYL5 binding motif was identified in 43 genes, and TSPYL5 appeared to function as a transcription factor for most of those genes. In summary, genome-wide significant SNPs in TSPYL5 were associated with elevated plasma E2 in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. SNP rs2583506 created a functional estrogen response element, and LCLs with variant SNP genotypes displayed increased E2-dependent TSPYL5 expression. TSPYL5 induced CYP19A1 expression and that of many other genes. These studies have revealed a novel mechanism for regulating aromatase expression and plasma E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women with ER(+) breast cancer.	 17194218 16862161 10835412 6472127 8076586 1825497 20354183 12928347 7707406 20128387 12913152 18757419 14623544 19200528 18319309 20876420 19834503 20048079 12409064 17701901 21407268 20625535 16061840 20981092 21170034 14623514 15158124 2208160 20923822 12839940

23544013	Genome-wide association study in BRCA1 mutation carriers identifies novel loci associated with breast and ovarian cancer risk.	BRCA1-associated breast and ovarian cancer risks can be modified by common genetic variants. To identify further cancer risk-modifying loci, we performed a multi-stage GWAS of 11,705 BRCA1 carriers (of whom 5,920 were diagnosed with breast and 1,839 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer), with a further replication in an additional sample of 2,646 BRCA1 carriers. We identified a novel breast cancer risk modifier locus at 1q32 for BRCA1 carriers (rs2290854, P = 2.7 × 10(-8), HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.09-1.20). In addition, we identified two novel ovarian cancer risk modifier loci: 17q21.31 (rs17631303, P = 1.4 × 10(-8), HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.17-1.38) and 4q32.3 (rs4691139, P = 3.4 × 10(-8), HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.17-1.38). The 4q32.3 locus was not associated with ovarian cancer risk in the general population or BRCA2 carriers, suggesting a BRCA1-specific association. The 17q21.31 locus was also associated with ovarian cancer risk in 8,211 BRCA2 carriers (P = 2×10(-4)). These loci may lead to an improved understanding of the etiology of breast and ovarian tumors in BRCA1 carriers. Based on the joint distribution of the known BRCA1 breast cancer risk-modifying loci, we estimated that the breast cancer lifetime risks for the 5% of BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk are 28%-50% compared to 81%-100% for the 5% at highest risk. Similarly, based on the known ovarian cancer risk-modifying loci, the 5% of BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk have an estimated lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 28% or lower, whereas the 5% at highest risk will have a risk of 63% or higher. Such differences in risk may have important implications for risk prediction and clinical management for BRCA1 carriers.	 21593217 21169536 22384356 21118973 23544012 17384015 15880399 22253144 20852632 21283786 17080083 16537453 21844186 19147532 19915575 20040092 22351618 18355772 17999359 22053997 19497887 23535730 22522925 19656774 22446964 19838192 23535731 6745643 22144499 15654335 20852631 23535733 3061869 17293876 17554300 18182601 20399636 12900793 18060068 22714938 23535729 18349832 22504418 22348646 12677558
23544012	Identification of a BRCA2-specific modifier locus at 6p24 related to breast cancer risk.	Common genetic variants contribute to the observed variation in breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers; those known to date have all been found through population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To comprehensively identify breast cancer risk modifying loci for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we conducted a deep replication of an ongoing GWAS discovery study. Using the ranked P-values of the breast cancer associations with the imputed genotype of 1.4 M SNPs, 19,029 SNPs were selected and designed for inclusion on a custom Illumina array that included a total of 211,155 SNPs as part of a multi-consortial project. DNA samples from 3,881 breast cancer affected and 4,330 unaffected BRCA2 mutation carriers from 47 studies belonging to the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 were genotyped and available for analysis. We replicated previously reported breast cancer susceptibility alleles in these BRCA2 mutation carriers and for several regions (including FGFR2, MAP3K1, CDKN2A/B, and PTHLH) identified SNPs that have stronger evidence of association than those previously published. We also identified a novel susceptibility allele at 6p24 that was inversely associated with risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers (rs9348512; per allele HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90, P = 3.9 × 10(-8)). This SNP was not associated with breast cancer risk either in the general population or in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The locus lies within a region containing TFAP2A, which encodes a transcriptional activation protein that interacts with several tumor suppressor genes. This report identifies the first breast cancer risk locus specific to a BRCA2 mutation background. This comprehensive update of novel and previously reported breast cancer susceptibility loci contributes to the establishment of a panel of SNPs that modify breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers. This panel may have clinical utility for women with BRCA2 mutations weighing options for medical prevention of breast cancer.	 12226108 10802651 3061869 7729426 15467710 15880399 17018785 17409409 17384015 17999359 18355772 18349832 18708398 19543373 19656774 20453838 20598278 20852631 20981092 21060860 21118973 21285253 21278746 21750175 21593217 22351618 22714938 22348646 23544013 22053997 10629551 6745643
23535967	Using multiple measures for quantitative trait association analyses: application to estimated glomerular filtration rate.	Studies of multiple measures of a quantitative trait can have greater precision and thus statistical power compared with single-measure studies, but this has rarely been studied in the relation to quantitative trait measurement error models in genetic association studies. Using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a quantitative measure of kidney function, as an example we constructed measurement error models of a quantitative trait with systematic and random error components. We then examined the effects on precision of the parameter estimate between genetic loci and eGFR, resulting from varying the correlation and contribution of the error components. We also compared the empirical results from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of kidney function in 9049 European Americans: a single measure model, a three-measure model of the same biomarker of kidney function and a six-measure model of different biomarkers of kidney function. Simulations showed that given the same amount of overall errors, inclusion of measures with less correlated systematic errors led to greater gain in precision. The empirical GWAS results confirmed that both the three- and six-measure models detected more eGFR-associated genomic loci with stronger statistical association than the single-measure model despite some heterogeneity among the measures. Multiple measures of a quantitative trait can increase the statistical power of a study without additional participant recruitment. However, careful attention must be paid to the correlation of systematic errors and inconsistent associations when different biomarkers or methods are used to measure the quantitative trait. 	 11499557 22305758 11904577 12671064 2646917 2200925 1594806 9290224 16332993 18295055 18358317 19019849 19369661 19625992 20233392 20383146 20562874 20537455 20839289 21307931 21701565 11855950
23535911	Genome-wide scan revealed that polymorphisms in the PNPLA3, SAMM50, and PARVB genes are associated with development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in Japan.	We examined the genetic background of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the Japanese population, by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS). For GWAS, 392 Japanese NAFLD subjects and 934 control individuals were analyzed. For replication studies, 172 NAFLD and 1,012 control subjects were monitored. After quality control, 261,540 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in autosomal chromosomes were analyzed using a trend test. Association analysis was also performed using multiple logistic regression analysis using genotypes, age, gender and body mass index (BMI) as independent variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate allelic effect of significant SNPs on biochemical traits and histological parameters adjusted by age, gender, and BMI. Rs738409 in the PNPLA3 gene was most strongly associated with NAFLD after adjustment (P = 6.8 × 10(-14), OR = 2.05). Rs2896019, and rs381062 in the PNPLA3 gene, rs738491, rs3761472, and rs2143571 in the SAMM50 gene, rs6006473, rs5764455, and rs6006611 in the PARVB gene had also significant P values (<2.0 × 10(-10)) and high odds ratios (1.84-2.02). These SNPs were found to be in the same linkage disequilibrium block and were associated with decreased serum triglycerides and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in NAFLD patients. These SNPs were associated with steatosis grade and NAFLD activity score (NAS). Rs738409, rs2896019, rs738491, rs6006473, rs5764455, and rs6006611 were associated with fibrosis. Polymorphisms in the SAMM50 and PARVB genes in addition to those in the PNPLA3 gene were observed to be associated with the development and progression of NAFLD.	 11501945 19302184 21381068 20648472 12542595 7489979 22719876 9867708 21176169 21659620 17998334 11961152 15915461 12404245 7382552 19729411 20164304 10348825 11296695 15297300 21068004 20648554 19624767 11473047 18445359 22724004 10488700 18820647 20708005 9547102 22792295 17701901 18588668 22252321 20029421 23023705 11266382 21423719 18723451
23534349	Generalization of variants identified by genome-wide association studies for electrocardiographic traits in African Americans.	Electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements vary by ancestry. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci that contribute to ECG measurements; however, most are performed in Europeans collected from population-based cohorts or surveys. The strongest associations reported are in NOS1AP with QT interval and SCN10A with PR and QRS durations. The extent to which these associations can be generalized to African Americans has yet to be determined. Using electronic medical records, PR and QT intervals, QRS duration, and heart rate were determined in 455 African Americans as part of the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project and Northwestern University NUgene Project. We tested for an association between these ECG traits and >930K SNPs. We identified a total 36 novel associations with PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and heart rate at p < 1.0 × 10(-6). Using published GWAS data, we compared our results with those previously identified in other populations. Five associations originally identified in other populations generalized with respect to statistical significance and direction of effect. A total of 43 associations have a consistent direction of effect with European and/or Asian populations. This work provides a catalogue of generalized versus nongeneralized associations, a necessary step in prioritizing GWAS-identified regions for further fine-mapping in diverse populations. 	 19492015 22125226 19389651 19639606 20395969 21044898 21162740 21589926 22037903 20622881 21347284 20062061 21981779 17565224 21325150 12193783 15297300 21269473 19140131 16648850 20733501 8528244 22912591 10448219 8541846 18500243 19908384 20031603 21041692 20062060 20634204 7889574 17701901 21076409 20062063 17903306 18669863 17568746 10595921 19305408 7828904
23555300	Genome-wide association study and gene expression analysis identifies CD84 as a predictor of response to etanercept therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.	Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) biologic therapy is a widely used treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unknown why some RA patients fail to respond adequately to anti-TNF therapy, which limits the development of clinical biomarkers to predict response or new drugs to target refractory cases. To understand the biological basis of response to anti-TNF therapy, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of more than 2 million common variants in 2,706 RA patients from 13 different collections. Patients were treated with one of three anti-TNF medications: etanercept (n = 733), infliximab (n = 894), or adalimumab (n = 1,071). We identified a SNP (rs6427528) at the 1q23 locus that was associated with change in disease activity score (ΔDAS) in the etanercept subset of patients (P = 8 × 10(-8)), but not in the infliximab or adalimumab subsets (P>0.05). The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3' UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P = 1 × 10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P = 0.004 in 132 RA patients). Consistent with the genetic findings, higher CD84 gene expression correlated with lower cross-sectional DAS (P = 0.02, n = 210) and showed a non-significant trend for better ΔDAS in a subset of RA patients with gene expression data (n = 31, etanercept-treated). A small, multi-ethnic replication showed a non-significant trend towards an association among etanercept-treated RA patients of Portuguese ancestry (n = 139, P = 0.4), but no association among patients of Japanese ancestry (n = 151, P = 0.8). Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity. These findings support a model in which CD84 genotypes and/or expression may serve as a useful biomarker for response to etanercept treatment in RA patients of European ancestry.	 7818570 15005015 8546736 15641091 20870100 20309874 15509629 21179534 21061259 21483280 21441907 22044414 22150039 22064851 21952740 22446960 22446963 22422731 15965027 15973463 16862161 17027888 17572673 17701901 17696278 17804836 17873874 17673491 18385279 18615156 18852200 19157532 19525953 20463871 20453842 11564780 11855950 12759288 12906870 12928397 7640345
23548203	Genome-wide association studies identify several new loci associated with pigmentation traits and skin cancer risk in European Americans.	Aiming to identify novel genetic loci for pigmentation and skin cancer, we conducted a series of genome-wide association studies on hair color, eye color, number of sunburns, tanning ability and number of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) among 10 183 European Americans in the discovery stage and 4504 European Americans in the replication stage (for eye color, 3871 males in the discovery stage and 2496 males in the replication stage). We targeted novel chromosome regions besides the known ones for replication. As a result, we identified a new region downstream of the EDNRB gene on 13q22 associated with hair color and the strongest association was the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs975739 (P = 2.4 × 10(-14); P = 5.4 × 10(-9) in the discovery set and P = 1.2 × 10(-6) in the replication set). Using blue, intermediate (including green) and brown eye colors as co-dominant outcomes, we identified the SNP rs3002288 in VASH2 on 1q32.3 associated with brown eye (P = 7.0 × 10(-8); P = 5.3 × 10(-5) in the discovery set and P = 0.02 in the replication set). Additionally, we identified a significant interaction between the SNPs rs7173419 and rs12913832 in the OCA2 gene region on brown eye color (P-value for interaction = 3.8 × 10(-3)). As for the number of NMSCs, we identified two independent SNPs on chr6 and one SNP on chromosome 14: rs12203592 in IRF4 (P = 7.2 × 10(-14); P = 1.8 × 10(-8) in the discovery set and P = 6.7 × 10(-7) in the replication set), rs12202284 between IRF4 and EXOC2 (P = 5.0 × 10(-8); P = 6.6 × 10(-7) in the discovery set and P = 3.0 × 10(-3) in the replication set) and rs8015138 upstream of GNG2 (P = 6.6 × 10(-8); P = 5.3 × 10(-7) in the discovery set and P = 0.01 in the replication set). 	 19619260 19578363 19340012 20127975 20418489 21221757 21515942 21679469 21700618 21926416 22211791 20546537 10926539 12819783 14566096 14681826 15201217 15379248 15489060 7258341 7199888 1678444 7891157 7771439 9119548 15671430 15637718 15793588 15837981 16650841 16489054 16145050 16862161 16943234 17537913 17529973 17289863 17952075 18252222 18483556 18488028 18775669 18579639 18849993 19383829 19204325 19320733 19715440
23511034	Genome-wide association study of ulcerative colitis in Koreans suggests extensive overlapping of genetic susceptibility with Caucasians.	Recent genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses have identified 47 susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis (UC) in Caucasian populations. A previous genome-wide association study of UC in a Japanese population suggested marginal sharing of susceptibility loci between Caucasian and Asian populations. We performed a genome-wide association studies to identify UC susceptibility loci in a Korean population and further comparative study.	
23535730	GWAS meta-analysis and replication identifies three new susceptibility loci for ovarian cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified four susceptibility loci for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), with another two suggestive loci reaching near genome-wide significance. We pooled data from a GWAS conducted in North America with another GWAS from the UK. We selected the top 24,551 SNPs for inclusion on the iCOGS custom genotyping array. We performed follow-up genotyping in 18,174 individuals with EOC (cases) and 26,134 controls from 43 studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We validated the two loci at 3q25 and 17q21 that were previously found to have associations close to genome-wide significance and identified three loci newly associated with risk: two loci associated with all EOC subtypes at 8q21 (rs11782652, P = 5.5 × 10(-9)) and 10p12 (rs1243180, P = 1.8 × 10(-8)) and another locus specific to the serous subtype at 17q12 (rs757210, P = 8.1 × 10(-10)). An integrated molecular analysis of genes and regulatory regions at these loci provided evidence for functional mechanisms underlying susceptibility and implicated CHMP4C in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.	 16862161 18653518 22256951 14633622 20852632 21499250 17846035 18252211 20362230 20951327 10891514 16563094 21720365 20952405 20526366 19302216 20852633 20581827 20360942 21482675 20065031 19648919 16258507 19760597 18511562 21368754 20852631 21475838 19295514 19680443 9637117 23535729 20627891 18094714 22422861 21441907 18613948 21949640
23535729	Large-scale genotyping identifies 41 new loci associated with breast cancer risk.	Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Common variants at 27 loci have been identified as associated with susceptibility to breast cancer, and these account for ∼9% of the familial risk of the disease. We report here a meta-analysis of 9 genome-wide association studies, including 10,052 breast cancer cases and 12,575 controls of European ancestry, from which we selected 29,807 SNPs for further genotyping. These SNPs were genotyped in 45,290 cases and 41,880 controls of European ancestry from 41 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The SNPs were genotyped as part of a collaborative genotyping experiment involving four consortia (Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study, COGS) and used a custom Illumina iSelect genotyping array, iCOGS, comprising more than 200,000 SNPs. We identified SNPs at 41 new breast cancer susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Further analyses suggest that more than 1,000 additional loci are involved in breast cancer susceptibility.	 23544012 23544013 22037553 22133146 22267197 22331459 22461340 22539603 22139079 22885922 22976474 22410776 23535730 10891514 11101836 11245426 11267660 11315092 12079286 23540573 22532805 12610780 14557987 14662653 15146459 8896551 8969618 9806774 16415884 16651380 16682732 17109766 17293876 17293864 17434869 17545519 17529973 17529974 17529967 17875692 17846035 18088386 18180189 18438407 18653518 18979497 19219042 19223247 19330027 19330030 19571811 19767753 20145154 20233392 20453838 20453196 20702402 20852631 20852632 21263130 21346143 21527583 21852249 22005519 23535731 23535732
23535733	Genome-wide association studies identify four ER negative-specific breast cancer risk loci.	Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors represent 20-30% of all breast cancers, with a higher proportion occurring in younger women and women of African ancestry. The etiology and clinical behavior of ER-negative tumors are different from those of tumors expressing ER (ER positive), including differences in genetic predisposition. To identify susceptibility loci specific to ER-negative disease, we combined in a meta-analysis 3 genome-wide association studies of 4,193 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 35,194 controls with a series of 40 follow-up studies (6,514 cases and 41,455 controls), genotyped using a custom Illumina array, iCOGS, developed by the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS). SNPs at four loci, 1q32.1 (MDM4, P = 2.1 × 10(-12) and LGR6, P = 1.4 × 10(-8)), 2p24.1 (P = 4.6 × 10(-8)) and 16q12.2 (FTO, P = 4.0 × 10(-8)), were associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer (P > 0.05). These findings provide further evidence for distinct etiological pathways associated with invasive ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers.	 12206512 23544013 17389037 17434869 17529973 19497887 20233392 20197764 20520800 20542480 20616382 20935630 21191117 21750655 22037553 22331459 22684628 22976474 23535649 23535729 23535731
23535732	Identification of 23 new prostate cancer susceptibility loci using the iCOGS custom genotyping array.	Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males in developed countries. To identify common prostate cancer susceptibility alleles, we genotyped 211,155 SNPs on a custom Illumina array (iCOGS) in blood DNA from 25,074 prostate cancer cases and 24,272 controls from the international PRACTICAL Consortium. Twenty-three new prostate cancer susceptibility loci were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). More than 70 prostate cancer susceptibility loci, explaining ∼30% of the familial risk for this disease, have now been identified. On the basis of combined risks conferred by the new and previously known risk loci, the top 1% of the risk distribution has a 4.7-fold higher risk than the average of the population being profiled. These results will facilitate population risk stratification for clinical studies.	 20855462 21084273 20473942 21526222 21465221 21602798 21769933 21743057 22236224 22308973 22366784 22268124 22610119 22955616 23023329 23104005 23065704 23535729 23535733 23544013 20998131 20562874 10433620 15583692 16461460 17384015 17572673 17846035 18264097 18708398 18653518 19330030 19767754 19917249 20204290 20197460 20233392
23555189	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic determinants of urine PCA3 levels in men.	Prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) is a non-coding gene specifically overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) that has great potential as a clinical biomarker for predicting prostate biopsy outcome. However, genetic determinants of PCA3 expression level remain unknown. To investigate the association between genetic variants and PCA3 mRNA level, a genome-wide association study was conducted in 1371 men of European descent in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events trial. First-voided urine specimens containing prostate cells were obtained after digital rectal examination. The PROGENSA PCA3 assay was used to determine PCA3 score in the urinary samples. A linear regression model was used to detect the associations between (single nucleotide polymorphisms) SNPs and PCA3 score under an additive genetic model, adjusting for age and population stratification. Two SNPs, rs10993994 in β-microseminoprotein at 10q11.23 and rs10424878 in kallikrein-related peptidase 2 at 19q13.33, were associated with PCA3 score at genome-wide significance level (P = 1.22 x 10(-9) and 1.06 x 10(-8), respectively). Men carrying the rs10993994 "T" allele or rs10424878 "A" allele had higher PCA3 score compared with men carrying rs10993994 "C" allele or rs10424878 "G" allele (β = 1.25 and 1.24, respectively). This is the first comprehensive search for genetic determinants of PCA3 score. The novel loci identified may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of PCA3 expression as a potential marker of PCa.	 20058238 19720969 20850153 20967219 21332814 21541972 21756274 22998901 10604382 12727822 12805332 12814669 12873976 15371831 3347596 9187691 9306417 15599939 16627561 16862161 17085659 17572673 17636412 17701901 18264097 18353398 19383797 19434657 19474385 20637539
23535734	Identification of seven loci affecting mean telomere length and their association with disease.	Interindividual variation in mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with cancer and several age-associated diseases. We report here a genome-wide meta-analysis of 37,684 individuals with replication of selected variants in an additional 10,739 individuals. We identified seven loci, including five new loci, associated with mean LTL (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Five of the loci contain candidate genes (TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1 and RTEL1) that are known to be involved in telomere biology. Lead SNPs at two loci (TERC and TERT) associate with several cancers and other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, a genetic risk score analysis combining lead variants at all 7 loci in 22,233 coronary artery disease cases and 64,762 controls showed an association of the alleles associated with shorter LTL with increased risk of coronary artery disease (21% (95% confidence interval, 5-35%) per standard deviation in LTL, P = 0.014). Our findings support a causal role of telomere-length variation in some age-related diseases.	 17316384 17223473 17874998 17869047 18411343 18348202 18753630 18957201 18762552 19129229 19561590 19854130 20072607 20085953 20139977 19889414 20354512 20421499 20502693 20616382 20634204 20935629 21113150 21378990 21467229 21695195 21909115 22075998 21708826 21878343 11520856 11517337 22527283 11927518 12000852 12193671 12499305 12514102 12540856 12649083 12958120 14732735 15044956 15210109 1438199 7977349 15520935 15574496 16112303 17024208 17043079 17623782

23527680	Genome-wide association study of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity measured as quantitative traits.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) offer the benefit of a hypothesis-free approach to measuring the quantitative effect of genetic variants on affection status. Generally the findings of GWAS relying on ADHD status have been non-significant, but the one study using quantitative measures of symptoms found SLC9A9 and SLC6A1 were associated with inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Accordingly, we performed a GWAS using quantitative measures of each ADHD subtype measured with the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) scale in two community-based samples. This scale captures the full range of attention and kinetic behavior; from high levels of attention and appropriate activity to the inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity associated with ADHD within two community-based samples. Our discovery sample comprised 1,851 participants (mean age = 22.8 years [4.8]; 50.6% female), while our replication sample comprised 155 participants (mean age = 26.3 years [3.1]; 68.4% females). Age, sex, age × sex, and age2 were included as covariates and the results from each sample were combined using meta-analysis, then analyzed with a gene-based test to estimate the combined effect of markers within genes. We compare our results with markers that have previously been found to have a strong association with ADHD symptoms. Neither the GWAS nor subsequent meta-analyses yielded genome-wide significant results; the strongest effect was observed at rs2110267 (4.62 × 10-7) for symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. The strongest effect in the gene-based test was for GPR139 on symptoms of inattention (6.40 × 10-5). Replication of this study with larger samples will add to our understanding of the genetic etiology of ADHD.	
23565137	SORL1 is genetically associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Japanese, Koreans and Caucasians.	To discover susceptibility genes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), we conducted a 3-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) using three populations: Japanese from the Japanese Genetic Consortium for Alzheimer Disease (JGSCAD), Koreans, and Caucasians from the Alzheimer Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC). In Stage 1, we evaluated data for 5,877,918 genotyped and imputed SNPs in Japanese cases (n = 1,008) and controls (n = 1,016). Genome-wide significance was observed with 12 SNPs in the APOE region. Seven SNPs from other distinct regions with p-values <2×10(-5) were genotyped in a second Japanese sample (885 cases, 985 controls), and evidence of association was confirmed for one SORL1 SNP (rs3781834, P = 7.33×10(-7) in the combined sample). Subsequent analysis combining results for several SORL1 SNPs in the Japanese, Korean (339 cases, 1,129 controls) and Caucasians (11,840 AD cases, 10,931 controls) revealed genome wide significance with rs11218343 (P = 1.77×10(-9)) and rs3781834 (P = 1.04×10(-8)). SNPs in previously established AD loci in Caucasians showed strong evidence of association in Japanese including rs3851179 near PICALM (P = 1.71×10(-5)) and rs744373 near BIN1 (P = 1.39×10(-4)). The associated allele for each of these SNPs was the same as in Caucasians. These data demonstrate for the first time genome-wide significance of LOAD with SORL1 and confirm the role of other known loci for LOAD in Japanese. Our study highlights the importance of examining associations in multiple ethnic populations.	 21460841 19036982 9343467 17761686 16862161 22279231 22015308 17459730 17220890 18541377 21358043 8232972 16174740 22472873 22711829 20616382 1202204 3249767 21460840 20236449 16123114 16642434 20951388 21220680 16740596 17701901 22869155 22673115 19064752 19543373 6610841 19442637
23551011	Genome-wide association study of pre-eclampsia detects novel maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy-number variants in subsets of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study cohort.	A genome-wide association study was undertaken to identify maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy-number variants (CNVs) associated with pre-eclampsia. Case-control analysis was performed on 1070 Afro-Caribbean (n = 21 cases and 1049 controls) and 723 Hispanic (n = 62 cases and 661 controls) mothers and 1257 mothers of European ancestry (n = 50 cases and 1207 controls) from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study. European ancestry subjects were genotyped on Illumina Human610-Quad and Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic subjects were genotyped on Illumina Human1M-Duo BeadChip microarrays. Genome-wide SNP data were analyzed using PLINK. CNVs were called using three detection algorithms (GNOSIS, PennCNV, and QuantiSNP), merged using CNVision, and then screened using stringent criteria. SNP and CNV findings were compared to those of the Study of Pregnancy Hypertension in Iowa (SOPHIA), an independent pre-eclampsia case-control dataset of Caucasian mothers (n = 177 cases and 116 controls). A list of top SNPs were identified for each of the HAPO ethnic groups, but none reached Bonferroni-corrected significance. Novel candidate CNVs showing enrichment among pre-eclampsia cases were also identified in each of the three ethnic groups. Several variants were suggestively replicated in SOPHIA. The discovered SNPs and copy-number variable regions present interesting candidate genetic variants for pre-eclampsia that warrant further replication and investigation. 	 20059347 17921354 17701901 17341461 17122850 16862161 15994632 15733721 10468424 9563982 2242360 7259998 15384082 12642066 12113977 12044323 11125122 22748001 22479352 21658581 20634204 21209939 20548291
23562540	GWAS of cerebrospinal fluid tau levels identifies risk variants for Alzheimer's disease.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau), and Aβ₄₂ are established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have been used as quantitative traits for genetic analyses. We performed the largest genome-wide association study for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau/ptau levels published to date (n = 1,269), identifying three genome-wide significant loci for CSF tau and ptau: rs9877502 (p = 4.89 × 10⁻⁹ for tau) located at 3q28 between GEMC1 and OSTN, rs514716 (p = 1.07 × 10⁻⁸ and p = 3.22 × 10⁻⁹ for tau and ptau, respectively), located at 9p24.2 within GLIS3 and rs6922617 (p = 3.58 × 10⁻⁸ for CSF ptau) at 6p21.1 within the TREM gene cluster, a region recently reported to harbor rare variants that increase AD risk. In independent data sets, rs9877502 showed a strong association with risk for AD, tangle pathology, and global cognitive decline (p = 2.67 × 10⁻⁴, 0.039, 4.86 × 10⁻⁵, respectively) illustrating how this endophenotype-based approach can be used to identify new AD risk loci.	 21460841 15984010 22343410 20634593 11160418 19749406 21605046 18046769 20932310 12709467 16862161 21085570 19539887 18358330 16961266 21554923 12130773 20943911 22685416 23150934 21552263 17366635 21347408 18813964 18541914 9702683 20862329 21139041 11094148 21715678 16372280 22357843 22054870 19822868 19020205 22091726 19142572 21460840 22533436 12521230 21123754 22821396 14706948 17982457 21515849 12601108 10072051 18466480 18509095 15324364 15014128 15936505 19361613 17012293 21825236 16845085 6610841 17512092
23593202	Bivariate genome-wide association analyses identified genes with pleiotropic effects for femoral neck bone geometry and age at menarche.	Femoral neck geometric parameters (FNGPs), which include cortical thickness (CT), periosteal diameter (W), buckling ratio (BR), cross-sectional area (CSA), and section modulus (Z), contribute to bone strength and may predict hip fracture risk. Age at menarche (AAM) is an important risk factor for osteoporosis and bone fractures in women. Some FNGPs are genetically correlated with AAM. In this study, we performed a bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify new candidate genes responsible for both FNGPs and AAM. In the discovery stage, we tested 760,794 SNPs in 1,728 unrelated Caucasian subject, followed by replication analyses in independent samples of US Caucasians (with 501 subjects) and Chinese (with 826 subjects). We found six SNPs that were associated with FNGPs and AAM. These SNPs are located in three genes (i.e. NRCAM, IDS and LOC148145), suggesting these three genes may co-regulate FNGPs and AAM. Our findings may help improve the understanding of genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying both osteoporosis and AAM.	 15336612 19714249 17680356 12577181 16234971 8717549 15797957 11923910 17541737 20354449 15845590 16292600 16107566 19282985 15491506 14504711 19786129 22810918 17303000 22077147 18776908 17064891 21102462 11683425 15571588 15297300 12730767 15231015 18664314 18924135 10423024 17701901 16845089 15688123 16491291 10841181 15797184 28524629 19802512 21956439 20175129 17079199
23593239	The molecular genetic architecture of self-employment.	Economic variables such as income, education, and occupation are known to affect mortality and morbidity, such as cardiovascular disease, and have also been shown to be partly heritable. However, very little is known about which genes influence economic variables, although these genes may have both a direct and an indirect effect on health. We report results from the first large-scale collaboration that studies the molecular genetic architecture of an economic variable-entrepreneurship-that was operationalized using self-employment, a widely-available proxy. Our results suggest that common SNPs when considered jointly explain about half of the narrow-sense heritability of self-employment estimated in twin data (σ(g)(2)/σ(P)(2) = 25%, h(2) = 55%). However, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across sixteen studies comprising 50,627 participants did not identify genome-wide significant SNPs. 58 SNPs with p<10(-5) were tested in a replication sample (n = 3,271), but none replicated. Furthermore, a gene-based test shows that none of the genes that were previously suggested in the literature to influence entrepreneurship reveal significant associations. Finally, SNP-based genetic scores that use results from the meta-analysis capture less than 0.2% of the variance in self-employment in an independent sample (p≥0.039). Our results are consistent with a highly polygenic molecular genetic architecture of self-employment, with many genetic variants of small effect. Although self-employment is a multi-faceted, heavily environmentally influenced, and biologically distal trait, our results are similar to those for other genetically complex and biologically more proximate outcomes, such as height, intelligence, personality, and several diseases.	 11315092 20601437 20691247 12111919 20562875 16463022 22223662 21267061 20031568 8786073 22344220 21618601 12499305 22427719 3555518 16060722 23025612 20881960 14744081 18349094 8122813 20054611 21670730 12958120 20616382 12076884 21376301 20935630 20585395 23012269 21173776 2729252 20980249 20598278 21142928 11731797 7993309 10157429 23482589 21826061 8227991 1585961 22566634 22832902 19812666 10379515 22586112 17701901 19199283 10681884 21874068 8054091 8403348 17247344 21167468 8528256 19571811 7352607 11503162 19461999 8929413
23563609	Genome-wide SNP and CNV analysis identifies common and low-frequency variants associated with severe early-onset obesity.	Common and rare variants associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity account for <5% of the variance in BMI. We performed SNP and copy number variation (CNV) association analyses in 1,509 children with obesity at the extreme tail (>3 s.d. from the mean) of the BMI distribution and 5,380 controls. Evaluation of 29 SNPs (P < 1 × 10(-5)) in an additional 971 severely obese children and 1,990 controls identified 4 new loci associated with severe obesity (LEPR, PRKCH, PACS1 and RMST). A previously reported 43-kb deletion at the NEGR1 locus was significantly associated with severe obesity (P = 6.6 × 10(-7)). However, this signal was entirely driven by a flanking 8-kb deletion; absence of this deletion increased risk for obesity (P = 6.1 × 10(-11)). We found a significant burden of rare, single CNVs in severely obese cases (P < 0.0001). Integrative gene network pathway analysis of rare deletions indicated enrichment of genes affecting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the neuronal regulation of energy homeostasis.	 19966786 19151714 20634204 20838587 20935630 21708048 21935397 22223662 22343897 22498250 22532805 22484627 15297675 10466767 15946856 17316299 17434869 17496892 17554300 17572673 18454148 18586225 18604207 18927395 20421936
23563607	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 11 new loci for anthropometric traits and provides insights into genetic architecture.	Approaches exploiting trait distribution extremes may be used to identify loci associated with common traits, but it is unknown whether these loci are generalizable to the broader population. In a genome-wide search for loci associated with the upper versus the lower 5th percentiles of body mass index, height and waist-to-hip ratio, as well as clinical classes of obesity, including up to 263,407 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 4 new loci (IGFBP4, H6PD, RSRC1 and PPP2R2A) influencing height detected in the distribution tails and 7 new loci (HNF4G, RPTOR, GNAT2, MRPS33P4, ADCY9, HS6ST3 and ZZZ3) for clinical classes of obesity. Further, we find a large overlap in genetic structure and the distribution of variants between traits based on extremes and the general population and little etiological heterogeneity between obesity subgroups.	 21935397 3712713 22158537 22235250 22242009 22223662 22344219 22344221 22383892 9029679 9519560 15992544 15940704 17873877 17982457 18159244 18344981 18591433 18604207 19079261 19151714 19219422 19487278 19557161 19571811 19528091 19553259 19524639 20081857 20081858 20346437 20421936 20616382 20881960 20935629 20935630 21047794 21118518 21376301 21303902 21533022 21708048 22426310 22484627 22772370 22430306 17322881 16183647 21308769 11234459 12733722 14624724 15297675 22041814

23575227	The chromosome 3q25 genomic region is associated with measures of adiposity in newborns in a multi-ethnic genome-wide association study.	Newborns characterized as large and small for gestational age are at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during the first year of life as well as for obesity and dysglycemia as children and adults. The intrauterine environment and fetal genes contribute to the fetal size at birth. To define the genetic architecture underlying the newborn size, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 4281 newborns in four ethnic groups from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study. We tested for association with newborn anthropometric traits (birth length, head circumference, birth weight, percent fat mass and sum of skinfolds) and newborn metabolic traits (cord glucose and C-peptide) under three models. Model 1 adjusted for field center, ancestry, neonatal gender, gestational age at delivery, parity, maternal age at oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); Model 2 adjusted for Model 1 covariates, maternal body mass index (BMI) at OGTT, maternal height at OGTT, maternal mean arterial pressure at OGTT, maternal smoking and drinking; Model 3 adjusted for Model 2 covariates, maternal glucose and C-peptide at OGTT. Strong evidence for association was observed with measures of newborn adiposity (sum of skinfolds model 3 Z-score 7.356, P = 1.90×10⁻¹³, and to a lesser degree fat mass and birth weight) and a region on Chr3q25.31 mapping between CCNL and LEKR1. These findings were replicated in an independent cohort of 2296 newborns. This region has previously been shown to be associated with birth weight in Europeans. The current study suggests that association of this locus with birth weight is secondary to an effect on fat as opposed to lean body mass.	 7926349 22504419 8989136 9384200 9609578 9677213 9881526 10068385 10426171 14857788 16434511 16611675 17407456 17194218 18216018 18463375 19011170 19200528 19376489 20089115 20372150 20714348 20616382 20811451 20718045 21116306 21429275 21307140 21775754 22073261 22125221 21885063 22479352 10740335 10751748 11206409 11707480 11809615 12113977 14682500 15265471 7282605 6685976 6538464 6374903 6541980 3591799 3117303 2712811 2570282 1954451 1727584 8173400 23202124 7613432

23585552	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic risk underlying primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.	Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is an important cause of vision loss and can potentially lead to blindness. The underlying pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood. We applied a two-stage genetic association discovery phase followed by a replication phase in a combined total of 2833 RRD cases and 7871 controls. The discovery phase involved a genome-wide association scan of 867 affected individuals and 1953 controls from Scotland, followed by genotyping and testing 4347 highest ranking or candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in independent sets of cases (1000) and controls (2912) of Dutch and British origin. None of the SNPs selected reached a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for significance (P < 1.27 × 10(-7)). The strongest association, for rs12960119 (P = 1.58 × 10(-7)) located within an intron of the SS18 gene. Further testing was carried out in independent case-control series from London (846 cases) and Croatia (120 cases). The combined meta-analysis identified one association reaching genome-wide significance for rs267738 (OR = 1.29, P = 2.11 × 10(-8)), a missense coding SNP and eQTL for CERS2 encoding the protein ceramide synthase 2. Several of the top signals showing suggestive significance in the combined meta-analysis encompassed genes with a documented role in cell adhesion or migration, including SS18, TIAM1, TSTA3 and LDB2, which warrant further investigation. This first genetic association study of RRD supports a polygenic component underlying RRD risk since 27.4% of the underlying RRD liability could be explained by the collective additive effects of the genotyped SNP from the discovery genome-wide scan. 	
23575436	New susceptibility loci in MYL2, C12orf51 and OAS1 associated with 1-h plasma glucose as predisposing risk factors for type 2 diabetes in the Korean population.	Most recently, 1-h hyperglycemia has been recognized as an additional risk factor for type 2 diabetes. To date, previous genome-wide association studies for glycemic traits have a limited impact on the fasting state and 2-h plasma glucose level in an oral glucose challenge. To identify genetic susceptibility in different stages of glucose tolerance, we performed a meta-analysis for glycemic traits including 1-h plasma glucose (1-hPG) from 14 232 non-diabetic individuals in the Korean population. Newly implicated variants (MYL2, C12orf51 and OAS1) were found to be significantly associated with 1-hPG. We also demonstrated associations with gestational diabetes mellitus. Our results could provide additional insight into the genetic variation in the clinical range of glycemia. 	
23583978	A meta-analysis identifies new loci associated with body mass index in individuals of African ancestry.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 36 loci associated with body mass index (BMI), predominantly in populations of European ancestry. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association of >3.2 million SNPs with BMI in 39,144 men and women of African ancestry and followed up the most significant associations in an additional 32,268 individuals of African ancestry. We identified one new locus at 5q33 (GALNT10, rs7708584, P = 3.4 × 10(-11)) and another at 7p15 when we included data from the GIANT consortium (MIR148A-NFE2L3, rs10261878, P = 1.2 × 10(-10)). We also found suggestive evidence of an association at a third locus at 6q16 in the African-ancestry sample (KLHL32, rs974417, P = 6.9 × 10(-8)). Thirty-two of the 36 previously established BMI variants showed directionally consistent effect estimates in our GWAS (binomial P = 9.7 × 10(-7)), five of which reached genome-wide significance. These findings provide strong support for shared BMI loci across populations, as well as for the utility of studying ancestrally diverse populations.	 20400458 20581827 12417297 12651872 17122076 17434869 17982457 17658951 18454146 18454148 18593304 19079260 19079261 19151714 19188425 20081857 20081858 20126310 20346437 20421936 20686565 20935630 21292315 21216877 21687990 21909115 21998595 22253363 21701570 22344219 22344221 22484627
23583980	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for pulmonary fibrosis.	We performed a genome-wide association study of non-Hispanic, white individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs; n = 1,616) and controls (n = 4,683), with follow-up replication analyses in 876 cases and 1,890 controls. We confirmed association with TERT at 5p15, MUC5B at 11p15 and the 3q26 region near TERC, and we identified seven newly associated loci (Pmeta = 2.4 × 10(-8) to 1.1 × 10(-19)), including FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9 (19p13) and chromosomal regions 7q22 and 15q14-15. Our results suggest that genes involved in host defense, cell-cell adhesion and DNA repair contribute to risk of fibrotic IIPs.	 9887343 12707032 22791817 17194218 11841538 22384356 15516475 16371599 11519507 21506748 12676565 20066089 2604297 11590244 19020537 22138821 15044640 17572673 21506745 2221080 16613331 20616382 17392301 20126254 16698794 19100526 20738328 20517342 22751100 16258256 19570573 16917092 10594734 20805105 18635891 16700509 23321605 23001564 21946350 16109978 17460043 9517585 18628224 22901891 18835860 20634204 22751096 18318599 20660310 18204446 23269371 20173748 20656946 20421499 21167468 18382419 15976379 18753630 21506741 19543373 11790668 11991887 20214461 22706312 15860663
23583979	Identification of heart rate-associated loci and their effects on cardiac conduction and rhythm disorders.	Elevated resting heart rate is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In a 2-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in up to 181,171 individuals, we identified 14 new loci associated with heart rate and confirmed associations with all 7 previously established loci. Experimental downregulation of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio identified 20 genes at 11 loci that are relevant for heart rate regulation and highlight a role for genes involved in signal transmission, embryonic cardiac development and the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, congenital heart failure and/or sudden cardiac death. In addition, genetic susceptibility to increased heart rate is associated with altered cardiac conduction and reduced risk of sick sinus syndrome, and both heart rate-increasing and heart rate-decreasing variants associate with risk of atrial fibrillation. Our findings provide fresh insights into the mechanisms regulating heart rate and identify new therapeutic targets.	 19305408 8531965 19706367 19715440 20062060 21076409 9535482 16252236 16408054 17510291 17384015 17572673 17625558 17701901 17965497 18031506 18974171 19430483 20062063 21317889 21378987 21378990 21745477 22187277 22426310 22544366 22673903 22876189 20278752 20190752 20233392 20520814 20388839 20714348 20616382 20639392 20801495 19057666 10823906 12952881 7457467 6697463 6484569 3588564 1985358 1420083 19396169
23646285	Genome-wide association study of HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative essential hypersomnia.	Essential hypersomnia (EHS), a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, can be divided into two broad classes based on the presence or absence of the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele. HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive EHS and narcolepsy with cataplexy are associated with the same susceptibility genes. In contrast, there are fewer studies of HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative EHS which, we hypothesized, involves a different pathophysiological pathway than does narcolepsy with cataplexy. In order to identify susceptibility genes associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative EHS, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 125 unrelated Japanese EHS patients lacking the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele and 562 Japanese healthy controls. A comparative study was also performed on 268 HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative Caucasian hypersomnia patients and 1761 HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative Caucasian healthy controls. We identified three SNPs that each represented a unique locus- rs16826005 (P = 1.02E-07; NCKAP5), rs11854769 (P = 6.69E-07; SPRED1), and rs10988217 (P = 3.43E-06; CRAT) that were associated with an increased risk of EHS in this Japanese population. Interestingly, rs10988217 showed a similar tendency in its association with both HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative EHS and narcolepsy with cataplexy in both Japanese and Caucasian populations. This is the first GWAS of HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative EHS, and the identification of these three new susceptibility loci should provide additional insights to the pathophysiological pathway of this condition.	 12598816 18820697 15823167 16255080 17704776 18565458 18821565 11923451 18711365 21358852 18219583 12796782 15297300 6597978 23349733 19366998 19404393 19644074 19010793 3010426 21058334 11179016 11567138 19222302 20634204 19412176 17701901 19927159 12711127 981985 12666097 20702402 3000935 19488044 20889312
23599027	Genome-wide association study of age at menarche in African-American women.	African-American (AA) women have earlier menarche on average than women of European ancestry (EA), and earlier menarche is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes among other chronic diseases. Identification of common genetic variants associated with age at menarche has a potential value in pointing to the genetic pathways underlying chronic disease risk, yet comprehensive genome-wide studies of age at menarche are lacking for AA women. In this study, we tested the genome-wide association of self-reported age at menarche with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a total of 18 089 AA women in 15 studies using an additive genetic linear regression model, adjusting for year of birth and population stratification, followed by inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (Stage 1). Top meta-analysis results were then tested in an independent sample of 2850 women (Stage 2). First, while no SNP passed the pre-specified P < 5 × 10(-8) threshold for significance in Stage 1, suggestive associations were found for variants near FLRT2 and PIK3R1, and conditional analysis identified two independent SNPs (rs339978 and rs980000) in or near RORA, strengthening the support for this suggestive locus identified in EA women. Secondly, an investigation of SNPs in 42 previously identified menarche loci in EA women demonstrated that 25 (60%) of them contained variants significantly associated with menarche in AA women. The findings provide the first evidence of cross-ethnic generalization of menarche loci identified to date, and suggest a number of novel biological links to menarche timing in AA women. 	 22876189 23022100 23103231 11230615 11343036 11500528 12319855 11914195 12359790 12359816 12509562 12671122 12723990 15199113 4426599 705363 1607059 7749133 8543288 9093289 9794178 10208883 23160955 23283660 23424626 16049805 15779076 16186815 16862161 16782804 16951536 17016694 17053289 17321422 17325027 17550780 17701901 17541737 17680356 17943122 18245510 18245511 18245513 18320165 18391951 18590522 19017771 19471299 19634296 19715440 19838192 19955787 19439916 20080753 20084087 20233392 20395969 20398887 20398329 20400458 20512147 20616382 19448620 19448621 19448622 19448623 20734064 20935630 21058334 20937744 21102462 20962026 21262910 21359227 21637779 21478295 21753830 21852243 22037553 22125221 22024429 22179539 22253364 22258758 22479202 22629316
23594818	Evidence for shared genetic risk between methamphetamine-induced psychosis and schizophrenia.	Methamphetamine (METH) use can provoke psychotic reactions requiring immediate treatment, namely METH-induced psychosis. Although the distinction between METH-induced and primary psychosis is important for understanding their clinical courses, we do not have clear diagnostic procedure by their symptoms. Not only are there similarities between the clinical features of METH-induced psychosis and schizophrenia (SCZ), but there is also epidemiological evidence of a shared genetic risk between 'METH-related' disorders and SCZ, which makes the differentiation of these two conditions difficult. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) targeting METH-dependent patients. The METH sample group, used in the METH-dependence GWAS, included 236 METH-dependent patients and 864 healthy controls. We also included a 'within-case' comparison between 194 METH-induced psychosis patients and 42 METH-dependent patients without psychosis in a METH-induced psychosis GWAS. To investigate the shared genetic components between METH dependence, METH-induced psychosis, and SCZ, data from our previous SCZ GWAS (total N=1108) were re-analyzed. In the SNP-based analysis, none of the SNPs showed genome-wide significance in either data set. By performing a polygenic component analysis, however, we found that a large number of 'risk' alleles for METH-induced psychosis are over-represented in individuals with SCZ (Pbest=0.0090). Conversely, we did not detect enrichment either between METH dependence and METH-induced psychosis or between METH dependence and SCZ. The results support previous epidemiological and neurobiological evidence for a relationship between METH-induced psychosis and SCZ. These also suggest that the overlap between genes scored as positive in these data sets can have higher probability as susceptibility genes for psychosis.	 1553490 18347602 15892150 16172381 16702973 16862161 17701901 18316681 18820697 19165232 18521090 19571808 19571811 18317462 19219857 20068123 20479773 20598278 20466522 20713499 21036393 21167468 20832056 21440632 22193527 22041458 22641179 15542728
24429156	Genetic variants associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility and mortality: a genome-wide association study.	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease that probably involves several genetic loci. Several rare genetic variants and one common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MUC5B have been associated with the disease. Our aim was to identify additional common variants associated with susceptibility and ultimately mortality in IPF.	 16625196 21799077 21219635 21729893 21565292 21506748 21506741 21471066 21068441 20466729 19447831 19474294 19210659 18985539 18987746 18835860 18753630 18348202 16844727 17362526 17554300 14711911 12029063 11441107 10988139 10673212 10556148 16809633 23027871 22778396 22751096 22561965 22607134 22506007 22016448
23562823	Genome-wide association study in a Chinese population with diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness in adults. To identify genetic contributions in DR, we studied 2071 type 2 diabetics. We first conducted a genome-wide association study of 1007 individuals, comparing 570 subjects with ≥8 years duration without DR (controls) with 437 PDR (cases) in the Chinese discovery cohort. Cases and controls were similar for HbA1c, diabetes duration and body mass index. Association analysis with imputed data identified three novel loci: TBC1D4-COMMD6-UCHL3 (rs9565164, P = 1.3 × 10(-7)), LRP2-BBS5 (rs1399634, P = 2.0 × 10(-6)) and ARL4C-SH3BP4 (rs2380261, P = 2.1 × 10(-6)). Analysis of an independent cohort of 585 Hispanics diabetics with or without DR though did not confirm these signals. These genes are still of particular interest because they are involved in insulin regulation, inflammation, lipid signaling and apoptosis pathways, all of which are possibly involved with DR. Our finding nominates possible novel loci as potential DR susceptibility genes in the Chinese that are independent of the level of HbA1c and duration of diabetes and may provide insight into the pathophysiology of DR. 	 15147902 18974171 16862161 21441570 10052453 16251603 20706635 19349785 22455417 13129861 9588456 9742976 21873659 16938560 15855583 16325581 17911160 21193625 20616382 8366922 17251272 17574030 17395753 18771725 22330960 19081074 20580421 20530784 18539916 18223010 22122357 18765632 20699456 16816367 20149342 9356033 20871662 21477661 19837878 7619101 21310492 20634204 19679560 17701901 20040588 19543373 17632512 6759208 16573520
23642732	Association of SNPs in the UGT1A gene cluster with total bilirubin and mortality in the Diabetes Heart Study.	A negative relationship between total bilirubin concentration (TBili) and CVD risk has been documented in a series of epidemiological studies. In addition, TBili is thought to be under strong genetic regulation via the UGT1A gene family, suggesting it may be a heritable CVD risk factor. However, few studies directly relate TBili-associated UGT1A variants to CVD severity or outcome. This study replicated the genetic association for TBili in the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS), and examined the relationships of TBili-associated SNPs with measures of subclinical CVD and mortality.	 15618373 22211818 22954960 11849670 23322233 21646302 22416852 22493581 12816916 19296952 16290992 11019988 8206992 18460048 8620339 19414484 23091317 18343383 17249379 21409311 23010146 11157203 12709588 8287538 19419973 17000907 7565971 10749222
23603761	Dense genotyping of immune-related disease regions identifies 14 new susceptibility loci for juvenile idiopathic arthritis.	We used the Immunochip array to analyze 2,816 individuals with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), comprising the most common subtypes (oligoarticular and rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA), and 13,056 controls. We confirmed association of 3 known JIA risk loci (the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, PTPN22 and PTPN2) and identified 14 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for the first time. Eleven additional new regions showed suggestive evidence of association with JIA (P < 1 × 10(-6)). Dense mapping of loci along with bioinformatics analysis refined the associations to one gene in each of eight regions, highlighting crucial pathways, including the interleukin (IL)-2 pathway, in JIA disease pathogenesis. The entire Immunochip content, the HLA region and the top 27 loci (P < 1 × 10(-6)) explain an estimated 18, 13 and 6% of the risk of JIA, respectively. In summary, this is the largest collection of JIA cases investigated so far and provides new insight into the genetic basis of this childhood autoimmune disease.	 23143596 19648290 12124869 12202775 12364641 12468825 14760812 8520712 15934099 16024817 16024819 16273109 16862161 16775617 17336654 17554300 17194218 17701901 17804842 18417527 18681337 19116909 19248117 19565500 19644074 10677315 20072139 19674979 20191588 20508602 20506132 20634204 19430480 20827233 20463745 20976248 20722033 20864496 21167468 21345260 22057235 22532805 22561518 22294642 22354554 22941192 22961000 23128233 22922229 22936693 23143594
23620142	Genome-wide and gene-centric analyses of circulating myeloperoxidase levels in the charge and care consortia.	Increased systemic levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) are associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). To identify the genetic factors that are associated with circulating MPO levels, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a gene-centric analysis in subjects of European ancestry and African Americans (AAs). A locus on chromosome 1q31.1 containing the complement factor H (CFH) gene was strongly associated with serum MPO levels in 9305 subjects of European ancestry (lead SNP rs800292; P = 4.89 × 10(-41)) and in 1690 AA subjects (rs505102; P = 1.05 × 10(-8)). Gene-centric analyses in 8335 subjects of European ancestry additionally identified two rare MPO coding sequence variants that were associated with serum MPO levels (rs28730837, P = 5.21 × 10(-12); rs35897051, P = 3.32 × 10(-8)). A GWAS for plasma MPO levels in 9260 European ancestry subjects identified a chromosome 17q22 region near MPO that was significantly associated (lead SNP rs6503905; P = 2.94 × 10(-12)), but the CFH locus did not exhibit evidence of association with plasma MPO levels. Functional analyses revealed that rs800292 was associated with levels of complement proteins in serum. Variants at chromosome 17q22 also had pleiotropic cis effects on gene expression. In a case-control analysis of ∼80 000 subjects from CARDIoGRAM, none of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with CAD. These results suggest that distinct genetic factors regulate serum and plasma MPO levels, which may have relevance for various acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. The clinical implications for CAD and a better understanding of the functional basis for the association of CFH and MPO variants with circulating MPO levels require further study. 	 11111115 22407325 11479475 11781690 12952835 14573731 15006595 15108282 15314690 171281 1201628 2831184 9129009 9326240 9354683 15383453 15761122 15790935 16182131 16299065 16621965 17572253 17676061 18193043 18974833 19180233 19091698 19549636 19726691 20031590 20048194 19651119 20385819 20385826 20502693 20400780 20040767 20399194 20616382 20694013 20861866 21059827 20568015 21378990 21399633 21637784 21665990 21909106 21979047 11283158
23624525	Genome-wide association analyses in Han Chinese identify two new susceptibility loci for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	To identify susceptibility genes for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 506 individuals with sporadic ALS and 1,859 controls of Han Chinese ancestry. Ninety top SNPs suggested by the current GWAS and 6 SNPs identified by previous GWAS were analyzed in an independent cohort of 706 individuals with ALS and 1,777 controls of Han Chinese ancestry. We discovered two new susceptibility loci for ALS at 1q32 (CAMK1G, rs6703183, Pcombined = 2.92 × 10(-8), odds ratio (OR) = 1.31) and 22p11 (CABIN1 and SUSD2, rs8141797, Pcombined = 2.35 × 10(-9), OR = 1.52). These two loci explain 12.48% of the overall variance in disease risk in the Han Chinese population. We found no association evidence for the previously reported loci in the Han Chinese population, suggesting genetic heterogeneity of disease susceptibility for ALS between ancestry groups. Our study identifies two new susceptibility loci and suggests new pathogenic mechanisms of ALS.	 17827064 19261878 22595785 17428258 18174402 20562875 11771769 17428257 17553424 12637513 17671248 19734901 19169255 17572673 10964611 22761934 22523592 11715057 18084291 16033692 9859994 21989247 19838193 15217349 18817731 12753081 11517246
23612905	Robust evidence for five new Graves' disease risk loci from a staged genome-wide association analysis.	Graves' disease (GD), characterized by autoantibodies targeting antigens specifically expressed in thyroid tissues causing hyperthyroidism, is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, only a few loci for GD risk were confirmed in the various ethnic groups, and additional genetic determinants have to be detected. In this study, we carried out a three-stage study in 9529 patients with GD and 9984 controls to identify new risk loci for GD and found genome-wide significant associations in the overall populations for five novel susceptibility loci: the GPR174-ITM2A at Xq21.1, C1QTNF6-RAC2 at 22q12.3-13.1, SLAMF6 at 1q23.2, ABO at 9q34.2 and an intergenic region harboring two non-coding RNAs at 14q32.2 and one previous indefinite locus, TG at 8q24.22 (Pcombined < 5 × 10(-8)). The genotypes of corresponding variants at 14q32.2 and 8q24.22 were correlated with the expression levels of C14orf64 and a TG transcript skipping exon 46, respectively. This study increased the number of GD loci with compelling evidence and indicated that non-coding RNAs might be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of GD. 	
23620144	Genome-wide scan of job-related exhaustion with three replication studies implicate a susceptibility variant at the UST gene locus.	Job-related exhaustion is the core dimension of burnout, a work-related stress syndrome that has several negative health consequences. In this study, we explored the molecular genetic background of job-related exhaustion. A genome-wide analysis of job-related exhaustion was performed in the GENMETS subcohort (n = 1256) of the Finnish population-based Health 2000 study. Replication analyses included an analysis of the strongest associations in the rest of the Health 2000 sample (n = 1660 workers) and in three independent populations (the FINRISK population cohort, n = 10 753; two occupational cohorts, total n = 1451). Job-related exhaustion was ascertained using a standard self-administered questionnaire (the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)-GS exhaustion scale in the Health 2000 sample and the occupational cohorts) or a single question (FINRISK). A variant located in an intron of UST, uronyl-2-sulfotransferase (rs13219957), gave the strongest statistical evidence in the initial genome-wide study (P = 1.55 × 10(-7)), and was associated with job-related exhaustion in all the replication sets (P < 0.05; P = 6.75 × 10(-7) from the meta-analysis). Consistent with studies of mood disorders, individual common genetic variants did not have any strong effect on job-related exhaustion. However, the nominally significant signals from the allelic variant of UST in four separate samples suggest that this variant might be a weak risk factor for job-related exhaustion. Together with the previously reported associations of other dermatan/chondroitin sulfate genes with mood disorders, these results indicate a potential molecular pathway for stress-related traits and mark a candidate region for further studies of job-related and general exhaustion. 	 9805280 9407097 10187838 10352933 13688369 15925030 16038984 16337278 16341826 16503841 16505484 16648327 16680382 16813846 17395837 17845272 18079434 18684778 18819920 19017706 19959603 20360315 20630263 20418371 20516156 20038947 20125088 21042317 22388765 22399527 22306176 22445702 22472876 21890791 10704995 11007705 11148311 12556911 15208783 987581 7572242 10098877

23577725	Genetic factors in nonsmokers with age-related macular degeneration revealed through genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis.	Relatively little is known about the interaction between genes and environment in the complex etiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study aimed to identify novel factors associated with AMD by analyzing gene-smoking interactions in a genome-wide association study of 1207 AMD cases and 686 controls of Caucasian background with genotype data on 668,238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after quality control. Participants' history of smoking at least 100 cigarettes lifetime was determined by a self-administered questionnaire. SNP associations modeled the effect of the minor allele additively on AMD using logistic regression, with adjustment for age, sex, and ever/never smoking. Joint effects of SNPs and smoking were examined comparing a null model containing only age, sex, and smoking against an extended model including genotypic and interaction terms. Genome-wide significant main effects were detected at three known AMD loci: CFH (P = 7.51×10(-30) ), ARMS2 (P = 1.94×10(-23) ), and RDBP/CFB/C2 (P = 4.37×10(-10) ), while joint effects analysis revealed three genomic regions with P < 10(-5) . Analyses stratified by smoking found genetic associations largely restricted to nonsmokers, with one notable exception: the chromosome 18q22.1 intergenic SNP rs17073641 (between SERPINB8 and CDH7), more strongly associated in nonsmokers (OR = 0.57, P = 2.73 × 10(-5) ), with an inverse association among smokers (OR = 1.42, P = 0.00228), suggesting that smoking modifies the effect of some genetic polymorphisms on AMD risk.	 15761121 15761120 15761122 15870199 15895326 16174643 16288198 16518403 16642439 16862161 16936732 16936733 17000705 17053109 16774849 17210851 17270675 17283440 17557158 17634448 17701901 17576744 17767156 18161622 18162041 18203751 18316707 18776909 18806297 20028529 20385819 20385826 20374233 20861866 11004294 11097601 11297486 11141572 11524377 11594944 11927430 12202504 12714612 12714659 15013873 15078664 15078675 15163691 15234127 3421236 1639395 8002834 7864750 8859077 9512153 9623885 9634502 9761297 15767473 10420191
23643386	Weight loss after gastric bypass is associated with a variant at 15q26.1.	The amount of weight loss attained after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery follows a wide and normal distribution, and recent evidence indicates that this weight loss is due to physiological, rather than mechanical, mechanisms. To identify potential genetic factors associated with weight loss after RYGB, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 693 individuals undergoing RYGB and then replicated this analysis in an independent population of 327 individuals undergoing RYGB. We found that a 15q26.1 locus near ST8SIA2 and SLCO3A1 was significantly associated with weight loss after RYGB. Expression of ST8SIA2 in omental fat of these individuals at baseline was significantly associated with weight loss after RYGB. Gene expression analysis in RYGB and weight-matched, sham-operated (WMS) mice revealed that expression of St8sia2 and Slco3a1 was significantly altered in metabolically active tissues in RYGB-treated compared to WMS mice. These findings provide strong evidence for specific genetic influences on weight loss after RYGB and underscore the biological nature of the response to RYGB.	 14631946 22673227 15479938 15499184 3203132 16595758 16862161 16895978 16969366 17341711 17701901 17715408 18701606 18606867 19026940 18997674 19553259 19360006 19556976 20598278 20876408 20663923 20935630 21058334 21169809 21251984 20386566 20805826 21602305 21730028 21832118 22416083 22492873 22693595 15242781
23678272	Three new single nucleotide polymorphisms identified by a genome-wide association study in Korean patients with vitiligo.	Genetic susceptibility is involved in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Association studies with a whole genome-based approach instead of a single or a few candidate genes may be useful for discovering new susceptible genes. Although the etiology of non-segmental and segmental types is different, the association between gene polymorphisms and vitiligo has been reported, without defining types or in non-segmental type. Whole genome-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined in patients with non-segmental and segmental types of vitiligo using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K mapping array, and 10 functional classes of significant SNPs were selected. Genotyping and data analysis of selected 10 SNPs was performed using real-time PCR. Genotype and allele frequencies were significantly different between both types of vitiligo and three of the target SNPs, DNAH5 (rs2277046), STRN3 (rs2273171), and KIAA1005 (rs3213758). A stronger association was suggested between the mutation in KIAA1005 (rs3213758) and the segmental type compared to the non-segmental type of vitiligo. DNAH5 (rs2277046), STRN3 (rs2273171), and KIAA1005 (rs3213758) may be new vitiligo-related SNPs in Korean patients, either non-segmental or segmental type.	 16169686 16015369 17059358 17558409 17637824 18200060 18548110 18820938 19543371 19890347 20410501 22417114 10748158 11062149 11592035 11837458 15051538 8651021 9424078 9487014 15829235 16729966
23648065	Genome-wide association study of chemotherapeutic agent-induced severe neutropenia/leucopenia for patients in Biobank Japan.	Chemotherapeutic agents are notoriously known to have a narrow therapeutic range that often results in life-threatening toxicity. Hence, it is clinically important to identify the patients who are at high risk for severe toxicity to certain chemotherapy through a pharmacogenomics approach. In this study, we carried out multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 13 122 cancer patients who received different chemotherapy regimens, including cyclophosphamide- and platinum-based (cisplatin and carboplatin), anthracycline-based (doxorubicin and epirubicin), and antimetabolite-based (5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine) treatment, antimicrotubule agents (paclitaxel and docetaxel), and topoisomerase inhibitors (camptothecin and etoposide), as well as combination therapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, to identify genetic variants that are associated with the risk of severe neutropenia/leucopenia in the Japanese population. In addition, we used a weighted genetic risk scoring system to evaluate the cumulative effects of the suggestive genetic variants identified from GWAS in order to predict the risk levels of individuals who carry multiple risk alleles. Although we failed to identify genetic variants that surpassed the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 × 10(-8) ) through GWAS, probably due to insufficient statistical power and complex clinical features, we were able to shortlist some of the suggestive associated loci. The current study is at the relatively preliminary stage, but does highlight the complexity and problematic issues associated with retrospective pharmacogenomics studies. However, we hope that verification of these genetic variants through local and international collaborations could improve the clinical outcome for cancer patients.	
23644492	Genome-wide association study identifies common variants in SLC39A6 associated with length of survival in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.	We conducted a genome-wide scan of SNPs to identify variants associated with length of survival in 1,331 individuals with esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC), with associations validated in 2 independent sets including 1,962 individuals with this cancer. We identified rs1050631 in SLC39A6 as associated with the survival times of affected individuals, with the hazard ratio for death from ESCC in the combined sample being 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.43; P = 3.77 × 10(-8)). rs7242481, located in the 5' UTR of SLC39A6, disturbs a transcriptional repressor binding site and results in upregulation of SLC39A6 expression. Immunohistochemical staining of ESCC tissues showed that higher expression of SLC39A6 protein was correlated with shorter length of survival in individuals with advanced ESCC (P = 0.013). Knockdown of SLC39A6 expression suppressed proliferation and invasion in ESCC cells. These results suggest that SLC39A6 has an important role in the prognosis of ESCC and may be a potential therapeutic target.	 15789306 20036807 12659941 20006355 22110740 22232737 21642993 17825787 21087493 21878961 22213172 21042586 20729852 15541644 22142827 20085904 19887557 22219482 21880137 15129296 20729853 20308648 17551301 22665904 18522839 21375764 19559222 21118971 11846610 17185560 20922573 19698717 21483023 22350023 20646319 8091774 23180869 21073618 10406262 19852955 19724917
23650146	A genome-wide association study for venous thromboembolism: the extended cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, heritable disease resulting in high rates of hospitalization and mortality. Yet few associations between VTE and genetic variants, all in the coagulation pathway, have been established. To identify additional genetic determinants of VTE, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) among individuals of European ancestry in the extended cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology (CHARGE) VTE consortium. The discovery GWAS comprised 1,618 incident VTE cases out of 44,499 participants from six community-based studies. Genotypes for genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were imputed to approximately 2.5 million SNPs in HapMap and association with VTE assessed using study-design appropriate regression methods. Meta-analysis of these results identified two known loci, in F5 and ABO. Top 1,047 tag SNPs (P ≤ 0.0016) from the discovery GWAS were tested for association in an additional 3,231 cases and 3,536 controls from three case-control studies. In the combined data from these two stages, additional genome-wide significant associations were observed on 4q35 at F11 (top SNP rs4253399, intronic to F11) and on 4q28 at FGG (rs6536024, 9.7 kb from FGG; P < 5.0 × 10(-13) for both). The associations at the FGG locus were not completely explained by previously reported variants. Loci at or near SUSD1 and OTUD7A showed borderline yet novel associations (P < 5.0 × 10(-6) ) and constitute new candidate genes. In conclusion, this large GWAS replicated key genetic associations in F5 and ABO, and confirmed the importance of F11 and FGG loci for VTE. Future studies are warranted to better characterize the associations with F11 and FGG and to replicate the new candidate associations.	 19492150 19278955 19597492 19515723 19715440 19728115 19583818 20616382 21058334 20880254 21463476 21824919 21980494 22251481 22672568 23128226 17284699 10605758 10910940 11038326 11418660 11583312 12814980 12859034 15099278 3021194 2646917 1974250 2025141 1669507 8275211 8925592 8801636 9384654 10209995 16241947 16144795 16643425 17433897 17384015 17676998 17701901 17445871 18070814 18349091 19630821
23644456	Nonsense mutation in the LGR4 gene is associated with several human diseases and other traits.	Low bone mineral density (BMD) is used as a parameter of osteoporosis. Genome-wide association studies of BMD have hitherto focused on BMD as a quantitative trait, yielding common variants of small effects that contribute to the population diversity in BMD. Here we use BMD as a dichotomous trait, searching for variants that may have a direct effect on the risk of pathologically low BMD rather than on the regulation of BMD in the healthy population. Through whole-genome sequencing of Icelandic individuals, we found a rare nonsense mutation within the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) gene (c.376C>T) that is strongly associated with low BMD, and with osteoporotic fractures. This mutation leads to termination of LGR4 at position 126 and fully disrupts its function. The c.376C>T mutation is also associated with electrolyte imbalance, late onset of menarche and reduced testosterone levels, as well as an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and biliary tract cancer. Interestingly, the phenotype of carriers of the c.376C>T mutation overlaps that of Lgr4 mutant mice.	 22189423 20096396 19301403 21205862 22135314 19605502 16785743 22805710 21727895 19801982 22504420 21533022 17109061 18445777 9240735 18424556 21909076 19079262 15192078 17041600 20431112 18180210 21693646 16406039 18487371 18455228 21791950 21982879
23667675	Genome wide association study of age at menarche in the Japanese population.	Age at menarche (AAM) is a complex trait involving both genetic and environmental factors. To identify the genetic factors associated with AAM, we conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies using more than 15,000 Japanese female samples. Here, we identified an association between SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) rs364663 at the LIN28B locus and AAM, with a P-value of 5.49×10(-7) and an effect size of 0.089 (year). We also evaluated 33 SNPs that were previously reported to be associated with AAM in women of European ancestry. Among them, two SNPs rs4452860 and rs7028916 in TMEM38B indicated significant association with AAM in the same directions as reported in previous studies (P = 0.0013 with an effect size of 0.051) even after Bonferroni correction for the 33 SNPs. In addition, six loci in or near CCDC85A, LOC100421670, CA10, ZNF483, ARNTL, and RXRG exhibited suggestive association with AAM (P<0.05). Our findings elucidated the impact of genetic variations on AAM in the Japanese population.	 1639955 16782804 11925413 16917137 21738478 16210384 17680356 19448621 20189936 11854319 18292307 16862161 21750111 18391951 17982410 18464913 14570750 16731583 2349942 17611541 16971064 20734064 9199997 20512147 21242260 16107566 18391950 19715440 21196492 22965935 19448622 11287254 19448620 12723990 21102462 19448623 15879463 24301179 18029452 20172861 22747683 15779076 10230834 22344221 18817904 16394082 16804047 23316006 18951094 22496814 12972267 22387998 22396660 19012874 22797727 18647812 14685227 6494891 21499248

23666240	Identification of nine new susceptibility loci for testicular cancer, including variants near DAZL and PRDM14.	Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is the most common cancer in young men and is notable for its high familial risks. So far, six loci associated with TGCT have been reported. From genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of 307,291 SNPs in 986 TGCT cases and 4,946 controls, we selected for follow-up 694 SNPs, which we genotyped in a further 1,064 TGCT cases and 10,082 controls from the UK. We identified SNPs at nine new loci (1q22, 1q24.1, 3p24.3, 4q24, 5q31.1, 8q13.3, 16q12.1, 17q22 and 21q22.3) showing association with TGCT (P < 5 × 10(-8)), which together account for an additional 4-6% of the familial risk of TGCT. The loci include genes plausibly related to TGCT development. PRDM14, at 8q13.3, is essential for early germ cell specification, and DAZL, at 3p24.3, is required for the regulation of germ cell development. Furthermore, PITX1, at 5q31.1, regulates TERT expression and is the third TGCT-associated locus implicated in telomerase regulation.	 21441907 21300782 21551455 21623831 22037553 22064851 21993562 22405274 23535729 23535732 23666239 23462292 21339739 11279525 11514340 12711554 15208620 12932298 4115573 7670487 8896558 8968755 8968756 15502821 16224025 16107607 16549803 17031378 17344468 17942894 18194669 18622394 19001867 19043588 19151717 19410550 19483681 19483682 19578363 19578367 19865085 19836008 20543847 20840815 20953172 21412254

To identify additional AIS-associated loci, we expanded the study by adding X-chromosome SNPs in the GWAS and increasing the size of the replication cohorts. Through a stepwise association study including 1,819 cases and 25,939 controls, we identified a new susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q24.1 in Japanese (P = 2.25 × 10(-10); odds ratio (OR) = 1.28). The most significantly associated SNP, rs6570507, was in GPR126 (encoding G protein-coupled receptor 126). Its association was replicated in Han Chinese and European-ancestry populations (combined P = 1.27 × 10(-14); OR = 1.27). GPR126 was highly expressed in cartilage, and the knockdown of gpr126 in zebrafish caused delayed ossification of the developing spine. Our results should provide insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of AIS.	 16172901 19092622 11501945 14736741 19343178 19745155 15225624 10635522 18391950 14516040 21308753 20425822 20881960 19878575 22955616 11008749 4767654 21216876 22019779 21068833 7576421 23096252 20546612 18239943 19266077 16875686 22301463 22777888 19222302 18401079 17701901 8769506 20010835 21613327 20702402
23669352	Genome-wide analysis of BMI in adolescents and young adults reveals additional insight into the effects of genetic loci over the life course.	Genetic loci for body mass index (BMI) in adolescence and young adulthood, a period of high risk for weight gain, are understudied, yet may yield important insight into the etiology of obesity and early intervention. To identify novel genetic loci and examine the influence of known loci on BMI during this critical time period in late adolescence and early adulthood, we performed a two-stage meta-analysis using 14 genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry with data on BMI between ages 16 and 25 in up to 29 880 individuals. We identified seven independent loci (P < 5.0 × 10⁻⁸) near FTO (P = 3.72 × 10⁻²³), TMEM18 (P = 3.24 × 10⁻¹⁷), MC4R (P = 4.41 × 10⁻¹⁷), TNNI3K (P = 4.32 × 10⁻¹¹), SEC16B (P = 6.24 × 10⁻⁹), GNPDA2 (P = 1.11 × 10⁻⁸) and POMC (P = 4.94 × 10⁻⁸) as well as a potential secondary signal at the POMC locus (rs2118404, P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁵ after conditioning on the established single-nucleotide polymorphism at this locus) in adolescents and young adults. To evaluate the impact of the established genetic loci on BMI at these young ages, we examined differences between the effect sizes of 32 published BMI loci in European adult populations (aged 18-90) and those observed in our adolescent and young adult meta-analysis. Four loci (near PRKD1, TNNI3K, SEC16B and CADM2) had larger effects and one locus (near SH2B1) had a smaller effect on BMI during adolescence and young adulthood compared with older adults (P < 0.05). These results suggest that genetic loci for BMI can vary in their effects across the life course, underlying the importance of evaluating BMI at different ages.	 21935397 12721663 17496892 17235396 19151714 19079261 19715440 17434869 19542202 19880856 17572673 18604207 21779088 19144223 20935630 8172099 17565041 22344219 22344221 20233392 18454148 9545414 22484627 15321794 20421936 21063014 20724581 20386548 19478790 19057666 18387595 17701901 10817843 17578381 21167468 21773009 15251908 18159244 19079260
23666239	Meta-analysis identifies four new loci associated with testicular germ cell tumor.	We conducted a meta-analysis to identify new susceptibility loci for testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). In the discovery phase, we analyzed 931 affected individuals and 1,975 controls from 3 genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted replication in 6 independent sample sets comprising 3,211 affected individuals and 7,591 controls. In the combined analysis, risk of TGCT was significantly associated with markers at four previously unreported loci: 4q22.2 in HPGDS (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-1.26; P = 1.11 × 10(-8)), 7p22.3 in MAD1L1 (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.14-1.29; P = 5.59 × 10(-9)), 16q22.3 in RFWD3 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.18-1.34; P = 5.15 × 10(-12)) and 17q22 (rs9905704: OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.18-1.33; P = 4.32 × 10(-13) and rs7221274: OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.12-1.28; P = 4.04 × 10(-9)), a locus that includes TEX14, RAD51C and PPM1E. These new TGCT susceptibility loci contain biologically plausible genes encoding proteins important for male germ cell development, chromosomal segregation and the DNA damage response.	 22493223 22538716 22508459 22320869 22140272 19204904 19483681 19483682 20173098 20354512 20400964 20502693 20543847 14704198 15208620 15184900 15298952 6128640 1313741 8580300 8611417 9413462 10415348 15590968 15737930 15737931 15994931 16549803 17060358 17117392 20811155 20925043 21549307 21558276 21612857 21678065 21551455 21887724 21865362 22795133 22955989 22960744 22965656 23462292 17167184 17283118 17312021 17293864 17234637 17873381 18071360 18184914 18454172 19035442 10658529 10888877 10932193 11979442 12042300 14667503 20562874 20516147 20811451 22064851 22265413 22194441 22405274 22421439
23670970	Genetic modifiers of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.	Diabetes is a common age-dependent complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) that is strongly influenced by modifier genes. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 3,059 individuals with CF (644 with CF-related diabetes [CFRD]) and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and 5' to the SLC26A9 gene that associated with CFRD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38; P = 3.6 × 10(-8)). Replication was demonstrated in 694 individuals (124 with CFRD) (HR, 1.47; P = 0.007), with combined analysis significant at P = 9.8 × 10(-10). SLC26A9 is an epithelial chloride/bicarbonate channel that can interact with the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the protein mutated in CF. We also hypothesized that common SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes also might affect risk for CFRD. A previous association of CFRD with SNPs in TCF7L2 was replicated in this study (P = 0.004; combined analysis P = 3.8 × 10(-6)), and type 2 diabetes SNPs at or near CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2 were associated with CFRD (P < 0.004). These five loci accounted for 8.3% of the phenotypic variance in CFRD onset and had a combined population-attributable risk of 68%. Diabetes is a highly prevalent complication of CF, for which susceptibility is determined in part by variants at SLC26A9 (which mediates processes proximate to the CF disease-causing gene) and at four susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes in the general population. 	 16024506 22338094 17030173 17268797 17381470 17332481 17416797 21809345 22325160 22466613 22885922 22872759 22945630 22996690 16804061 17701901 18040894 18216022 19004773 19289574 19126627 19585101 19738092 19643730 19817799 20075150 20118932 20658517 20981092 21058334 21115770 20681990 21423765 11510890 11836738 11834742 12111919 15048129 15292279 3346774 2039252 8592553 8772610 9864362 15601358 15870674 16207846 21526222 21602797 21626717 21841312
23677057	Identification of KCNN2 as a susceptibility locus for coronary artery aneurysms in Kawasaki disease using genome-wide association analysis.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is often complicated by coronary artery lesions (CALs), including aneurysms. Because of the complications associated with KD, this disorder is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children from developed countries. To identify genetic loci that confer a higher risk of developing CALs, we performed a case-control association study using previous genome-wide association study data for samples from KD cases only (n=186) by grouping KD patients without CALs (control: n=123) vs KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter>5 mm) (case: n=17). Twelve loci with one or more sequence variants were found to be significantly associated with CALs (P<1 × 10(-5)). Of these, an SNP (rs17136627) in the potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily N, member 2 (KCNN2) at 5q22.3 was validated in 32 KD patients with large aneurysms (diameter>5 mm) and 191 KD patients without CALs (odds ratio (OR)=12.6, P(combined)=1.96 × 10(-8)). This result indicates that the KCNN2 gene can have an important role in the development of coronary artery aneurysms in KD.	
23696099	Genetic variants that confer resistance to malaria are associated with red blood cell traits in African-Americans: an electronic medical record-based genome-wide association study.	To identify novel genetic loci influencing interindividual variation in red blood cell (RBC) traits in African-Americans, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2315 individuals, divided into discovery (n = 1904) and replication (n = 411) cohorts. The traits included hemoglobin concentration (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), RBC count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Patients were participants in the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and underwent genotyping of ~1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the Illumina Human1M-Duo array. Association analyses were performed adjusting for age, sex, site, and population stratification. Three loci previously associated with resistance to malaria-HBB (11p15.4), HBA1/HBA2 (16p13.3), and G6PD (Xq28)-were associated (P ≤ 1 × 10(-6)) with RBC traits in the discovery cohort. The loci replicated in the replication cohort (P ≤ 0.02), and were significant at a genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in the combined cohort. The proportions of variance in RBC traits explained by significant variants at these loci were as follows: rs7120391 (near HBB) 1.3% of MCHC, rs9924561 (near HBA1/A2) 5.5% of MCV, 6.9% of MCH and 2.9% of MCHC, and rs1050828 (in G6PD) 2.4% of RBC count, 2.9% of MCV, and 1.4% of MCH, respectively. We were not able to replicate loci identified by a previous GWAS of RBC traits in a European ancestry cohort of similar sample size, suggesting that the genetic architecture of RBC traits differs by race. In conclusion, genetic variants that confer resistance to malaria are associated with RBC traits in African-Americans. 	 11423617 22101970 14614139 7130394 6352482 2398834 1619469 8653873 15699438 15769889 15790781 16001361 16255080 22037903 22560525 17211848 17701901 18156501 19180233 19207024 19442502 19820697 19862010 20139978 20354512 20634204 20927387 20981092 21041692 21234875 21153663 21269473 21508311 21738480 21700265 22125226 12103252
23698163	Genome-wide association study of serum selenium concentrations.	Selenium is an essential trace element and circulating selenium concentrations have been associated with a wide range of diseases. Candidate gene studies suggest that circulating selenium concentrations may be impacted by genetic variation; however, no study has comprehensively investigated this hypothesis. Therefore, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with serum selenium concentrations in 1203 European descents from two cohorts: the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). We tested association between 2,474,333 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and serum selenium concentrations using linear regression models. In the first stage (PLCO) 41 SNPs clustered in 15 regions had p < 1 × 10(-5). None of these 41 SNPs reached the significant threshold (p = 0.05/15 regions = 0.003) in the second stage (WHI). Three SNPs had p < 0.05 in the second stage (rs1395479 and rs1506807 in 4q34.3/AGA-NEIL3; and rs891684 in 17q24.3/SLC39A11) and had p between 2.62 × 10(-7) and 4.04 × 10(-7) in the combined analysis (PLCO + WHI). Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings. Identification of genetic variation that impacts selenium concentrations may contribute to a better understanding of which genes regulate circulating selenium concentrations.	 10554523 19415410 10963212 11112379 11189684 11215509 11215510 11588133 11683552 12173025 12470897 12509226 12730442 12730444 12759393 14985676 3719945 3766450 3287776 8427200 7585090 19826042 20634204 20852007 21058334 21563143 21765007 21761138 22259188 22253303 21936966 22589738 22715394 22648711 22404120 22692883 9152512 9492970 15702311 17023702 17209198 17903306 17937618 18361410 18458833 18346308 19074884 18952151 19451621 19474294 10571008
23704328	Genome-wide association study of primary tooth eruption identifies pleiotropic loci associated with height and craniofacial distances.	Twin and family studies indicate that the timing of primary tooth eruption is highly heritable, with estimates typically exceeding 80%. To identify variants involved in primary tooth eruption, we performed a population-based genome-wide association study of 'age at first tooth' and 'number of teeth' using 5998 and 6609 individuals, respectively, from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and 5403 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966). We tested 2 446 724 SNPs imputed in both studies. Analyses were controlled for the effect of gestational age, sex and age of measurement. Results from the two studies were combined using fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis. We identified a total of 15 independent loci, with 10 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 'age at first tooth' and 11 loci for 'number of teeth'. Together, these associations explain 6.06% of the variation in 'age of first tooth' and 4.76% of the variation in 'number of teeth'. The identified loci included eight previously unidentified loci, some containing genes known to play a role in tooth and other developmental pathways, including an SNP in the protein-coding region of BMP4 (rs17563, P = 9.080 × 10(-17)). Three of these loci, containing the genes HMGA2, AJUBA and ADK, also showed evidence of association with craniofacial distances, particularly those indexing facial width. Our results suggest that the genome-wide association approach is a powerful strategy for detecting variants involved in tooth eruption, and potentially craniofacial growth and more generally organ development. 	 11237119 23202124 12684764 12812793 12908068 14706829 14767552 14997420 15052270 8104708 8696334 18391951 18391952 9371801 9598325 10330178 15593017 15916718 18037648 17621269 18252212 18434571 10642790 18505920 19011631 19060910 19343178 19156667 19090534 19539887 19681132 19875280 19915575 19956648 20041193 20195514 20091798 20400963 20400964 20616382 20634204 19430479 20881960 21058334 21102462 21273026 21653640 21931568 21854395 22341974 22415375 22504417 22504419 22920782 22949612 23250216 9254841 9214393 12620190

23717212	Imputation-based meta-analysis of severe malaria in three African populations.	Combining data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted at different locations, using genotype imputation and fixed-effects meta-analysis, has been a powerful approach for dissecting complex disease genetics in populations of European ancestry. Here we investigate the feasibility of applying the same approach in Africa, where genetic diversity, both within and between populations, is far more extensive. We analyse genome-wide data from approximately 5,000 individuals with severe malaria and 7,000 population controls from three different locations in Africa. Our results show that the standard approach is well powered to detect known malaria susceptibility loci when sample sizes are large, and that modern methods for association analysis can control the potential confounding effects of population structure. We show that pattern of association around the haemoglobin S allele differs substantially across populations due to differences in haplotype structure. Motivated by these observations we consider new approaches to association analysis that might prove valuable for multicentre GWAS in Africa: we relax the assumptions of SNP-based fixed effect analysis; we apply Bayesian approaches to allow for heterogeneity in the effect of an allele on risk across studies; and we introduce a region-based test to allow for heterogeneity in the location of causal alleles.	 20959295 19465909 19492015 17668372 22384356 11103309 11965279 22306652 6584911 22895189 21345260 20190752 21565292 22305225 21738480 17455985 21418562 21743469 19834557 18852200 20811451 19820697 19557189 22126751 19862010 19956792 21437273 17554300 15843560 20548291 21737059 21833088 21653516 22139419 22479202 21364697 19543373 19215730 20084087 21771975

23708190	A genome-wide association study identifies two risk loci for congenital heart malformations in Han Chinese populations.	Congenital heart malformation (CHM) is the most common form of congenital human birth anomaly and is the leading cause of infant mortality. Although some causative genes have been identified, little progress has been made in identifying genes in which low-penetrance susceptibility variants occur in the majority of sporadic CHM cases. To identify common genetic variants associated with sporadic non-syndromic CHM in Han Chinese populations, we performed a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a total of 4,225 CHM cases and 5,112 non-CHM controls. The GWAS stage included 945 cases and 1,246 controls and was followed by 2-stage validation with 2,160 cases and 3,866 controls. The combined analyses identified significant associations (P < 5.0 × 10⁻⁸) at 1p12 (rs2474937 near TBX15; odds ratio (OR) = 1.40; P = 8.44 × 10⁻¹⁰) and 4q31.1 (rs1531070 in MAML3; OR = 1.40; P = 4.99 × 10⁻¹²). These results extend current knowledge of genetic contributions to CHM in Han Chinese populations.	 10936053 18538293 16862161 12023302 22069191 17008524 17519398 11239417 18844489 16709898 21384533 16917909 19068278 9652610 17413276 16990131 17273550 19893584 7716513 20935629 16285859 22822471 17535917 19597048 18575602 19514064 20546612 12084585 11242049 15652702 19074289 20497191 8988165 11242110 21282637 20832395 17701901 18288184 19762328 10837027 18703928 18441319 17668378 16258075 14978031 8988164

Our discovery cohort comprised 1,995 CHD cases and 5,159 controls and included affected individuals from each of the 3 major clinical CHD categories (with septal, obstructive and cyanotic defects). When all CHD phenotypes were considered together, no region achieved genome-wide significant association. However, a region on chromosome 4p16, adjacent to the MSX1 and STX18 genes, was associated (P = 9.5 × 10⁻⁷) with the risk of ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) in the discovery cohort (N = 340 cases), and this association was replicated in a further 417 ASD cases and 2,520 controls (replication P = 5.0 × 10⁻⁵; odds ratio (OR) in replication cohort = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.65; combined P = 2.6 × 10⁻¹⁰). Genotype accounted for ~9% of the population-attributable risk of ASD.	 18667074 19597493 19915572 20092884 20634204 20981092 20929874 21399635 22199024 22503907 22939634 10742093 11118473 11315092 11369996 5212356 8696335 8988164 16221730 16862161 17030704 17384015 17463248 17554300 17572673 17701901 17586828 18285513 19106121 19401338
23726511	Genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for posttraumatic stress disorder.

23720494	Genome-wide association study identifies loci affecting blood copper, selenium and zinc.	Genetic variation affecting absorption, distribution or excretion of essential trace elements may lead to health effects related to sub-clinical deficiency. We have tested for allelic effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on blood copper, selenium and zinc in a genome-wide association study using two adult cohorts from Australia and the UK. Participants were recruited in Australia from twins and their families and in the UK from pregnant women. We measured erythrocyte Cu, Se and Zn (Australian samples) or whole blood Se (UK samples) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Genotyping was performed with Illumina chips and > 2.5 m SNPs were imputed from HapMap data. Genome-wide significant associations were found for each element. For Cu, there were two loci on chromosome 1 (most significant SNPs rs1175550, P = 5.03 × 10(-10), and rs2769264, P = 2.63 × 10(-20)); for Se, a locus on chromosome 5 was significant in both cohorts (combined P = 9.40 × 10(-28) at rs921943); and for Zn three loci on chromosomes 8, 15 and X showed significant results (rs1532423, P = 6.40 × 10(-12); rs2120019, P = 1.55 × 10(-18); and rs4826508, P = 1.40 × 10(-12), respectively). The Se locus covers three genes involved in metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids and potentially of the analogous Se compounds; the chromosome 8 locus for Zn contains multiple genes for the Zn-containing enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Where potentially relevant genes were identified, they relate to metabolism of the element (Se) or to the presence at high concentration of a metal-containing protein (Cu).	 6023853 16945521 17268249 17505969 17687451 17622322 17873877 18256235 18469257 18462017 18779302 19147802 19276540 19528881 19710611 19906252 19896111 20232210 20053595 20493851 20598278 20616382 20634204 20950764 20961297 21058334 21099294 21248196 20812787 21670538 21529783 21318622 21963101 22955616 22507742 22507743 10816601 11731797 12730449 15113935 15038597 6425451 3918596 16112185 16132136 16308488 17023702
23726366	Genome-wide characterization of shared and distinct genetic components that influence blood lipid levels in ethnically diverse human populations.	Blood lipid concentrations are heritable risk factors associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Lipid traits exhibit considerable variation among populations of distinct ancestral origin as well as between individuals within a population. We performed association analyses to identify genetic loci influencing lipid concentrations in African American and Hispanic American women in the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource. We validated one African-specific high-density lipoprotein cholesterol locus at CD36 as well as 14 known lipid loci that have been previously implicated in studies of European populations. Moreover, we demonstrate striking similarities in genetic architecture (loci influencing the trait, direction and magnitude of genetic effects, and proportions of phenotypic variation explained) of lipid traits across populations. In particular, we found that a disproportionate fraction of lipid variation in African Americans and Hispanic Americans can be attributed to genomic loci exhibiting statistical evidence of association in Europeans, even though the precise genes and variants remain unknown. At the same time, we found substantial allelic heterogeneity within shared loci, characterized both by population-specific rare variants and variants shared among multiple populations that occur at disparate frequencies. The allelic heterogeneity emphasizes the importance of including diverse populations in future genetic association studies of complex traits such as lipids; furthermore, the overlap in lipid loci across populations of diverse ancestral origin argues that additional knowledge can be gleaned from multiple populations.	 18292342 18039927 18348202 18305138 19148283 19304782 19543370 19812666 20031607 20137780 20502693 19755428 20562875 20686565 20647424 20616382 21031451 21058334 20935172 21167468 21331046 21347282 21378990 21738479 21738485 22125221 22021425 22479202 11931686 12547883 14575939 15210959 4337382 6475735 22604720 22748210 22820512 22955989 22939635 23236364 23555291 4054601 8942437 9343467 9449192 9786230 13751193 15769763 15712363 16357253 16378771 16282974 16429159 16511593 16773560 16862161 17357068 17701901
23722424	GWAS of 126,559 individuals identifies genetic variants associated with educational attainment.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment was conducted in a discovery sample of 101,069 individuals and a replication sample of 25,490. Three independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genome-wide significant (rs9320913, rs11584700, rs4851266), and all three replicate. Estimated effects sizes are small (coefficient of determination R(2) ≈ 0.02%), approximately 1 month of schooling per allele. A linear polygenic score from all measured SNPs accounts for ≈2% of the variance in both educational attainment and cognitive function. Genes in the region of the loci have previously been associated with health, cognitive, and central nervous system phenotypes, and bioinformatics analyses suggest the involvement of the anterior caudate nucleus. These findings provide promising candidate SNPs for follow-up work, and our effect size estimates can anchor power analyses in social-science genetics. 	 4911003 21909115 18763692 19915574 18263651 11315092 19553259 21151127 19220931 17351290 16926217 21297633 19451621 17254420 20048236 18075776 11799070 23137839 19861402 20167617 20834067 20562875 10865790 21048141 15316060 15148347 16671833 15947879 18771491 22507742 22253318 21890791 19079261 17943122 19001172 21804653 22427719 16698126 19915572 9247335 23220627 8200562 23128233 10891514 21681207 16239631 16032514 23358156 21051448 16060722 17572673 19424496 19734545 19084217 20881960 23563608 22310353 18824075 14717632 17676998 22843982 22159054 21877163 20616382 20935630 1576220 20167083 12101245 19200528 22471867 17554261 21102463 19503597 23064961 21173776 18852200 20228799 11129752 19700477 20339536 4039415 18587394 20598278 21829388 19602272 21653519 8639155 21142928 22589738 19767753 23482589 18760389 21946350 15052270 17567990 20202923 23028342 21058334 2392892 21318257 7425434 16934002 18053258 20037589 22658931 22426310 22566634 16251536 21900946 17554300 23363460 23263488 988067 18525043 19222302 23593239 22586112 18852893 21360792 17701901 21407268 20558539 7800110 19361613 18677645 19959603 12537860 22139419 22513993 19260138 21167468 12628169 18366642 22243964 20056765 20453842 19571811 21694764 15368602 10802651 19060910 22423221 19079260 10857866 16425095 20694014 10408549 23255883 20346758
23726668	A genome-wide association study of a sustained pattern of antidepressant response.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have failed to replicate common genetic variants associated with antidepressant response, as defined using a single endpoint. Genetic influences may be discernible by examining individual variation between sustained versus unsustained patterns of response, which may distinguish medication effects from non-specific, or placebo responses to active medication. We conducted a GWAS among 1116 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial who were characterized using Growth Mixture Modeling as showing a sustained versus unsustained pattern of clinical response over 12 weeks of treatment with citalopram. Replication analyses examined 585 subjects from the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) trial. The strongest association with sustained as opposed to unsustained response in STAR*D involved a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs10492002) within the acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3 gene (ACSS3, p-value=4.5×10(-6), odds ratio=0.61). No SNPs met our threshold for genome-wide significance. SNP data were available in GENDEP for 18 of the top 25 SNPs in STAR*D. The most replicable association was with SNP rs7816924 (p=0.008, OR=1.58); no SNP met the replication p-value threshold of 0.003. Joint analysis of these 18 SNPs resulted in the strongest signal coming from rs7816924 (p=2.11×10(-7)), which resides in chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 gene (CSGALNACT1). An exploratory genetic pathway analysis revealed evidence for an involvement of the KEGG pathway of long-term potentiation (FDR=.02). Results suggest novel genetic associations to sustained response. 	 11318201 22472876 12562566 12778843 12946886 6378117 15603739 16199517 16390886 17123473 17222456 17701901 17922940 19252156 19812673 19880459 19846067 19631948 20360315 20439394 20435672 19863842 20598278 20811451 21158559 21381817 21946334 22127194 22147842 22083729 22770672 22243633 23091423 23238717 22865056 11867360
23728934	Polygenic transmission and complex neuro developmental network for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: genome-wide association study of both common and rare variants.	Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex polygenic disorder. This study aimed to discover common and rare DNA variants associated with ADHD in a large homogeneous Han Chinese ADHD case-control sample. The sample comprised 1,040 cases and 963 controls. All cases met DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic criteria. We used the Affymetrix6.0 array to assay both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs). Genome-wide association analyses were performed using PLINK. SNP-heritability and SNP-genetic correlations with ADHD in Caucasians were estimated with genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). Pathway analyses were performed using the Interval enRICHment Test (INRICH), the Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE), and the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT). We did not find genome-wide significance for single SNPs but did find an increased burden of large, rare CNVs in the ADHD sample (P = 0.038). SNP-heritability was estimated to be 0.42 (standard error, 0.13, P = 0.0017) and the SNP-genetic correlation with European Ancestry ADHD samples was 0.39 (SE 0.15, P = 0.0072). The INRICH, DAPPLE, and GREAT analyses implicated several gene ontology cellular components, including neuron projections and synaptic components, which are consistent with a neurodevelopmental pathophysiology for ADHD. This study suggested the genetic architecture of ADHD comprises both common and rare variants. Some common causal variants are likely to be shared between Han Chinese and Caucasians. Complex neurodevelopmental networks may underlie ADHD's etiology.	 22420046 16314870 18329248 23021477 20957330 20562875 15076256 11923911 20060416 19351574 21996756 22420048 18821565 21324949 20051220 22843982 19546859 21376301 18988193 18839057 20436461 8178837 19638256 12187510 8307567 20732627 21895634 15305146 22016809 20732625 19384554 16946911 17701901 18980221 22513993 21167468 22138692 20888040 21249183
23728906	A genome-wide association study of sleep habits and insomnia.	Several aspects of sleep behavior such as timing, duration and quality have been demonstrated to be heritable. To identify common variants that influence sleep traits in the population, we conducted a genome-wide association study of six sleep phenotypes assessed by questionnaire in a sample of 2,323 individuals from the Australian Twin Registry. Genotyping was performed on the Illumina 317, 370, and 610K arrays and the SNPs in common between platforms were used to impute non-genotyped SNPs. We tested for association with more than 2,000,000 common polymorphisms across the genome. While no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance threshold, we identified a number of associations in plausible candidate genes. Most notably, a group of SNPs in the third intron of the CACNA1C gene ranked as most significant in the analysis of sleep latency (P = 1.3 × 10⁻⁶). We attempted to replicate this association in an independent sample from the Chronogen Consortium (n = 2,034), but found no evidence of association (P = 0.73). We have identified several other suggestive associations that await replication in an independent sample. We did not replicate the results from previous genome-wide analyses of self-reported sleep phenotypes after correction for multiple testing.	 22754043 16301095 2267475 6684786 19238806 10733689 12898572 18246983 19715440 20174623 19915576 18711365 20881960 5787679 20935630 15865952 7991958 16279934 18688819 17346965 20598278 19166596 17018599 20677014 17964164 11731797 20233392 19896111 5958255 17554300 19812666 17969472 22105623 19903925 20072116 19015202 17701901 16171284 10100809 18256235 17903308 19621016 7466126 17924335 16687280 18060068 1118533 19543373 12531146
23603763	Dense genotyping of immune-related disease regions identifies nine new risk loci for primary sclerosing cholangitis.	Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a severe liver disease of unknown etiology leading to fibrotic destruction of the bile ducts and ultimately to the need for liver transplantation. We compared 3,789 PSC cases of European ancestry to 25,079 population controls across 130,422 SNPs genotyped using the Immunochip. We identified 12 genome-wide significant associations outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 9 of which were new, increasing the number of known PSC risk loci to 16. Despite comorbidity with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 72% of the cases, 6 of the 12 loci showed significantly stronger association with PSC than with IBD, suggesting overlapping yet distinct genetic architectures for these two diseases. We incorporated association statistics from 7 diseases clinically occurring with PSC in the analysis and found suggestive evidence for 33 additional pleiotropic PSC risk loci. Together with network analyses, these findings add to the genetic risk map of PSC and expand on the relationship between PSC and other immune-mediated diseases.	 22955619 21699788 21151127 17194218 15738054 20172772 11719900 21374718 21345260 19923227 14597658 3659828 22554193 23128233 15573121 16800000 21538284 20017967 20507892 10446108 18674735 19944697 22821403 10372541 19037317 16496231 8707097 21413052 22057162 6982501 22521342 19557189 16776819 11095341 22286218 3203132 21725321 1850376 17701901 21761138 21833088 22057235 20981092 12753745 19092835 22902788 22961000 21398603 19543373 23033494 23143594 21249183
23727862	Genome-wide association study identifies two susceptibility loci for osteosarcoma.	Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy of adolescents and young adults. To better understand the genetic etiology of osteosarcoma, we performed a multistage genome-wide association study consisting of 941 individuals with osteosarcoma (cases) and 3,291 cancer-free adult controls of European ancestry. Two loci achieved genome-wide significance: a locus in the GRM4 gene at 6p21.3 (encoding glutamate receptor metabotropic 4; rs1906953; P = 8.1 × 10⁻⁹) and a locus in the gene desert at 2p25.2 (rs7591996 and rs10208273; P = 1.0 × 10⁻⁸ and 2.9 × 10⁻⁷, respectively). These two loci warrant further exploration to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to osteosarcoma.	 21131975 14704198 21437228 18622085 18264096 21619704 22200770 20697156 20429896 19197972 18090928 19684604 17234637 21465145 15591278 17060358 17572673 19483681 17096406 20972438 22955616 11183184 19451596 19407491 22833735 19526364 22327514 21965725 14528100 15867225 15736433 20530236 17554300 17684144 19648918 20061814 15184900 23263863 22139419 20981092 22700719 19836008 19543373 22423221
23725790	GWAS of DNA methylation variation within imprinting control regions suggests parent-of-origin association.	Imprinting control regions (ICRs) play a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining the non-random monoallelic expression of certain genes, via common regulatory elements such as non-coding RNAs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of DNA. We recently surveyed DNA methylation levels within four ICRs (H19-ICR, IGF2-DMR, KvDMR, and NESPAS-ICR) in whole-blood genomic DNA from 128 monozygotic (MZ) and 128 dizygotic (DZ) human twin pairs. Our analyses revealed high individual variation and intra-domain covariation in methylation levels across CpGs and emphasized the interaction between epigenetic variation and the underlying genetic sequence in a parent-of-origin fashion. Here, we extend our analysis to conduct two genome-wide screenings of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying either intra-domain covariation or parent-of-origin-dependent association with methylation status at individual CpG sites located within ICRs. Although genome-wide significance was not surpassed due to sample size limitations, the most significantly associated SNPs found through multiple-trait genome-wide association (MQFAM) included the previously described rs10732516, which is located in the vicinity of the H19-ICR. Similarly, we identified an association between rs965808 and methylation status within the NESPAS-ICR. This SNP is positioned within an intronic region of the overlapping genes GNAS and GNAS-AS1, which are imprinted genes regulated by the NESPAS-ICR. Sixteen other SNPs located in regions apart from the analyzed regions displayed suggestive association with intra-domain methylation. Additionally, we identified 13 SNPs displaying parent-of-origin association with individual methylation sites through family-based association testing. In this exploratory study, we show the value and feasibility of using alternative GWAS approaches in the study of the interaction between epigenetic state and genetic sequence within imprinting regulatory domains. Despite the relatively small sample size, we identified a number of SNPs displaying suggestive association either in a domain-wide or in a parent-of-origin fashion. Nevertheless, these associations will require future experimental validation or replication in larger and independent samples.

VKORC1 and CYP2C9 are important contributors to warfarin dose variability, but explain less variability for individuals of African descent than for those of European or Asian descent. We aimed to identify additional variants contributing to warfarin dose requirements in African Americans.	 12968085 8596909 22949490 9630825 15930419 16862161 17515465 18466099 18535201 18305455 18855533 19228618 19300499 19706858 19578179 19842940 19874474 20072124 20200517 20203262 20716240 20833655 21058334 21083927 21228733 21270790 22111719 22158446 22329724 22378156 22431865 22658545
23738518	A genome-wide association study for reading and language abilities in two population cohorts.	Candidate genes have been identified for both reading and language, but most of the heritable variance in these traits remains unexplained. Here, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of two large cohorts: population samples of Australian twins and siblings aged 12-25 years (n = 1177 from 538 families), and a younger cohort of children of the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and their Children (aged 8 and 9 years; maximum n = 5472). Suggestive association was indicated for reading measures and non-word repetition (NWR), with the greatest support found for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pseudogene, ABCC13 (P = 7.34 × 10(-8)), and the gene, DAZAP1 (P = 1.32 × 10(-6)). Gene-based analyses showed significant association (P < 2.8 × 10(-6)) for reading and spelling with genes CD2L1, CDC2L2 and RCAN3 in two loci on chromosome 1. Some support was found for the same SNPs having effects on both reading skill and NWR, which is compatible with behavior genetic evidence for influences of reading acquisition on phonological-task performance. The results implicate novel candidates for study in additional cohorts for reading and language abilities.	 21310003 16512171 18829873 23065966 21457949 20949370 15717286 11280415 8324999 21243420 23229871 22567092 18691054 11791209 19997522 19715440 18300295 22253303 21248734 21165691 11665325 16485179 18987363 15819646 17597587 19786962 20616382 16278297 18976480 19646677 17328696 17684495 9771635 20598278 17919296 20068590 23341075 21623652 19896111 11237119 11720121 21058334 19901951 15203202 17924335 23190410 16254601 12954984
23761726	Interrogation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha locus and corneal astigmatism in Australians of Northern European ancestry: results of a genome-wide association study.	Corneal astigmatism is a common eye disorder characterized by irregularities in corneal curvature. Recently, the rs7677751 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) locus was found to be associated with corneal astigmatism in people of Asian ancestry. In the present study, we sought to replicate this finding and identify other genetic markers of corneal astigmatism in an Australian population of Northern European ancestry.	 15557431 10366072 16283989 16862161 16877283 16990585 17701901 17855347 18385047 18391950 18695106 18974171 19265028 19803772 20485516 20395239 20598278 20691855 20616382 20719862 20981092 21058334 21098505 21665993 22144915 21984434 22635273 22969067 23301674 10937558 11328732 11349931 11731797 12628189 14624719 1682128 8709817 16186354
23754948	Sex-stratified genome-wide association studies including 270,000 individuals show sexual dimorphism in genetic loci for anthropometric traits.	Given the anthropometric differences between men and women and previous evidence of sex-difference in genetic effects, we conducted a genome-wide search for sexually dimorphic associations with height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip-ratio (133,723 individuals) and took forward 348 SNPs into follow-up (additional 137,052 individuals) in a total of 94 studies. Seven loci displayed significant sex-difference (FDR<5%), including four previously established (near GRB14/COBLL1, LYPLAL1/SLC30A10, VEGFA, ADAMTS9) and three novel anthropometric trait loci (near MAP3K1, HSD17B4, PPARG), all of which were genome-wide significant in women (P<5×10(-8)), but not in men. Sex-differences were apparent only for waist phenotypes, not for height, weight, BMI, or hip circumference. Moreover, we found no evidence for genetic effects with opposite directions in men versus women. The PPARG locus is of specific interest due to its role in diabetes genetics and therapy. Our results demonstrate the value of sex-specific GWAS to unravel the sexually dimorphic genetic underpinning of complex traits.	 20189936 19893501 20686565 20714348 20616382 20881960 20864672 20935629 20935630 21058334 21129722 19417063 19570815 19715440 19729412 20081858 21258337 21665192 21739720 21233810 22102887 22383892 22679397 10546691 11158468 11315092 11681806 12037649 12503980 12630956 14607804 14636121 14770193 15387477 15466016 5490179 5039732 150196 6238135 3986689 8621399 8943783 16252236 16271645 16360030 17130148 17434869 17384015 17463246 17463248 17463249 17572673 17494056 17676998 17701901 17875489 17656458 18071080 18280327 18372903 18391952 18454148 18388889 18332882 18839131 19005195 18974171 19057666 19060907 19079261 18974276 19474294 19557161 19359342 19561590 20233392 20057374
23743675	A meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies to identify novel loci for maximum number of alcoholic drinks.	Maximum number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a 24-h period (maxdrinks) is a heritable (>50 %) trait and is strongly correlated with vulnerability to excessive alcohol consumption and subsequent alcohol dependence (AD). Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have studied alcohol dependence, but few have concentrated on excessive alcohol consumption. We performed two GWAS using maxdrinks as an excessive alcohol consumption phenotype: one in 118 extended families (N = 2,322) selected from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), and the other in a case-control sample (N = 2,593) derived from the Study of Addiction: Genes and Environment (SAGE). The strongest association in the COGA families was detected with rs9523562 (p = 2.1 × 10(-6)) located in an intergenic region on chromosome 13q31.1; the strongest association in the SAGE dataset was with rs67666182 (p = 7.1 × 10(-7)), located in an intergenic region on chromosome 8. We also performed a meta-analysis with these two GWAS and demonstrated evidence of association in both datasets for the LMO1 (p = 7.2 × 10(-7)) and PLCL1 genes (p = 4.1 × 10(-6)) with maxdrinks. A variant in AUTS2 and variants in INADL, C15orf32 and HIP1 that were associated with measures of alcohol consumption in a meta-analysis of GWAS studies and a GWAS of alcohol consumption factor score also showed nominal association in the current meta-analysis. The present study has identified several loci that warrant further examination in independent samples. Among the top SNPs in each of the dataset (p ≤ 10(-4)) far more showed the same direction of effect in the other dataset than would be expected by chance (p = 2 × 10(-3), 3 × 10(-6)), suggesting that there are true signals among these top SNPs, even though no SNP reached genome-wide levels of significance. 	 22301922 22064851 22703173 23134050 23072454 23089632 11054770 12499305 15010446 2988001 2014795 8125982 8189735 10441588 16862161 17701901 17718394 17924348 18613369 19244173 19390609 19581569 19576574 20040588 20202923 20354512 20502693 20201924 20598278 20374207 20616382 21167468 21124317 21270382 21314694 21471458 21251925 21529783 21599714 22045766 21968928
23749188	Genome-wide association study of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma identifies 3q27 as a susceptibility locus in the Chinese population.	To identify genetic risk factors underlying non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) from the B cell lineage, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 253 Chinese individuals with B cell NHL (cases) and 1,438 controls and further validation in 1,175 cases and 5,492 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus, rs6773854, located between BCL6 (encoding B cell lymphoma protein 6) and LPP (encoding lipoma preferred partner) on oncogene-rich chromosome 3q27 that was significantly associated with increased risk of B cell NHL (meta-analysis P = 3.36 × 10⁻¹³, per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.44) and with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in particular (meta-analysis P = 1.14 × 10⁻¹¹, OR = 1.47). We found no evidence of association of rs6773854 with non-B cell NHLs (T cell and natural killer (NK) lineages) (P = 0.17, OR = 1.12) and observed significant heterogeneity between B cell and non-B cell subtypes (Phet = 0.01, I² = 84%). Our results provide insight that germline variation in the intergenic region between BCL6 and LPP has a role in risk of B cell lymphomagenesis.	 19944404 20547840 19700652 20639881 21261679 19330030 20190813 22543543 8812423 19944401 19586941 20393178 11460166 16389181 17707260 22037555 20702402 21151128 16815642 21533074 19620980 19438470
23740937	A systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus pan-meta-GWAS reveals new shared susceptibility loci.	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are two archetypal systemic autoimmune diseases which have been shown to share multiple genetic susceptibility loci. In order to gain insight into the genetic basis of these diseases, we performed a pan-meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) together with a replication stage including additional SSc and SLE cohorts. This increased the sample size to a total of 21,109 (6835 cases and 14,274 controls). We selected for replication 19 SNPs from the GWAS data. We were able to validate KIAA0319L (P = 3.31 × 10(-11), OR = 1.49) as novel susceptibility loci for SSc and SLE. Furthermore, we also determined that the previously described SLE susceptibility loci PXK (P = 3.27 × 10(-11), OR = 1.20) and JAZF1 (P = 1.11 × 10(-8), OR = 1.13) are shared with SSc. Supporting these new discoveries, we observed that KIAA0319L was overexpressed in peripheral blood cells of SSc and SLE patients compared with healthy controls. With these, we add three (KIAA0319L, PXK and JAZF1) and one (KIAA0319L) new susceptibility loci for SSc and SLE, respectively, increasing significantly the knowledge of the genetic basis of autoimmunity.	 21408207 16415888 21779181 21719445 22029983 21881596 22480065 16434469 17701901 18204446 18438865 18952825 19343178 19439502 19557189 19618249 19838195 20112391 20086096 20383147 20624949 20724309 20933377 21156761 20829310 21298027 21055901 21339219 21383967 22482804 22407130 22218928 22792215 23001478 22661643 11469464 7378088 3361530 2218183 9324032 9889186 15980575 20956978
23760081	A genome-wide association study identified new variants associated with the risk of chronic hepatitis B.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the predominant risk factor for chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of CHB identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci, including HLA-DP and HLA-DQ in Asian populations, as being associated with the risk of CHB. To confirm and identify the host genetic factors related to CHB infection, we performed another GWAS using a higher-density chip in Korean CHB carriers. We analyzed 1400 samples from Korean population (400 CHB cases and 1000 population controls) using a higher-density GWAS chip [1 140 419 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. In subsequent replication analysis, we further analyzed in an independent study of a Korean CHB cohort consisting of 2909 Korean samples (971 cases and 1938 controls). Logistic regression methods were used for statistical analysis adjusting for age and sex as covariates. This study identified two new risk-associated loci for CHB on the HLA region of chromosome 6, e.g. rs652888 on euchromatic histone-lysine-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2, P = 7.07 × 10(-13)) and rs1419881 on transcription factor 19 (TCF19, P = 1.26 × 10(-18)). Conditional analysis with nearby HLA CHB loci that were previously known, confirmed the independent genetic effects of these two loci on CHB.	
23753411	Genomic association analysis of common variants influencing antihypertensive response to hydrochlorothiazide.	To identify novel genes influencing blood pressure response to thiazide diuretic therapy for hypertension, we conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of ≈1.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a combined sample of 424 European Americans with primary hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses study (n=228) and the Genetic Epidemiology of Responses to Antihypertensive study (n=196). Polymorphisms associated with blood pressure response at P<10(-5) were tested for replication of the associations in independent samples of hydrochlorothiazide-treated European hypertensives. The rs16960228 polymorphism in protein kinase C, α replicated for same-direction association with diastolic blood pressure response in the Nordic Diltiazem study (n=420) and the Genetics of Drug Responsiveness in Essential Hypertension study (n=206), and the combined 4-study meta-analysis P value achieved genome-wide significance (P=3.3 × 10(-8)). Systolic or diastolic blood pressure responses were consistently greater in carriers of the rs16960228 A allele than in GG homozygotes (>4/4 mm Hg) across study samples. The rs2273359 polymorphism in the GNAS-EDN3 region also replicated for same-direction association with systolic blood pressure response in the Nordic Diltiazem study, and the combined 3-study meta-analysis P value approached genome-wide significance (P=5.5 × 10(-8)). The findings document clinically important effects of genetic variation at novel loci on blood pressure response to a thiazide diuretic, which may be a basis for individualization of antihypertensive drug therapy and identification of new drug targets.	 19663674 20639796 18591461 18348202 17324745 16172412 10523359 9149697 3049337 11849460 10972367 23175613 22566498 22413836 22080510 21938070 21909115 20725057 20616382 20233392 19474192 19249413
23776548	Genetic loci for retinal arteriolar microcirculation.	Narrow arterioles in the retina have been shown to predict hypertension as well as other vascular diseases, likely through an increase in the peripheral resistance of the microcirculatory flow. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study in 18,722 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium and the Blue Mountain Eye Study, to identify genetic determinants associated with variations in retinal arteriolar caliber. Retinal vascular calibers were measured on digitized retinal photographs using a standardized protocol. One variant (rs2194025 on chromosome 5q14 near the myocyte enhancer factor 2C MEF2C gene) was associated with retinal arteriolar caliber in the meta-analysis of the discovery cohorts at genome-wide significance of P-value <5×10(-8). This variant was replicated in an additional 3,939 individuals of European ancestry from the Australian Twins Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (rs2194025, P-value = 2.11×10(-12) in combined meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts). In independent studies of modest sample sizes, no significant association was found between this variant and clinical outcomes including coronary artery disease, stroke, myocardial infarction or hypertension. In conclusion, we found one novel loci which underlie genetic variation in microvasculature which may be relevant to vascular disease. The relevance of these findings to clinical outcomes remains to be determined.	 16380526 16317022 16505201 20031568 20081858 20141597 20233392 20686565 19430483 21060863 21300889 21347623 21625945 16505202 16469744 16723443 16801487 16877426 16840510 17041135 17351290 17431876 17524767 17554300 17562993 17626032 18070990 18332097 18469315 18574740 19139377 19129464 19755365 19687348 19728115 19803772 19801982 19680136 19884126 10599656 11146696 11150724 11315092 11525792 12020333 12397006 12689883 14562179 14970147 15177969 15223786 15175230 15302843 2646917 1669507 7637142 9097791 9162005 9329309 16513455

23770605	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple risk loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified 13 loci associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). To identify additional CLL susceptibility loci, we conducted the largest meta-analysis for CLL thus far, including four GWAS with a total of 3,100 individuals with CLL (cases) and 7,667 controls. In the meta-analysis, we identified ten independent associated SNPs in nine new loci at 10q23.31 (ACTA2 or FAS (ACTA2/FAS), P=1.22×10(-14)), 18q21.33 (BCL2, P=7.76×10(-11)), 11p15.5 (C11orf21, P=2.15×10(-10)), 4q25 (LEF1, P=4.24×10(-10)), 2q33.1 (CASP10 or CASP8 (CASP10/CASP8), P=2.50×10(-9)), 9p21.3 (CDKN2B-AS1, P=1.27×10(-8)), 18q21.32 (PMAIP1, P=2.51×10(-8)), 15q15.1 (BMF, P=2.71×10(-10)) and 2p22.2 (QPCT, P=1.68×10(-8)), as well as an independent signal at an established locus (2q13, ACOXL, P=2.08×10(-18)). We also found evidence for two additional promising loci below genome-wide significance at 8q22.3 (ODF1, P=5.40×10(-8)) and 5p15.33 (TERT, P=1.92×10(-7)). Although further studies are required, the proximity of several of these loci to genes involved in apoptosis suggests a plausible underlying biological mechanism.	 18758461 20562874 20562875 20639881 20553269 20856902 20595513 20981092 20855536 20731705 20699439 21167468 21131588 18978787 21376301 21554262 21743467 21704150 21983787 22037553 22064851 22200770 22144184 22323360 22471249 22686190 22700719 23047821 23066086 18978790 19074885 19151717 19286886 19543373 19578367 19550435 20062064 20101243 20386740 10835412 11418480 11984562 12717450 14574334 14704198 15079075 15184900 15342541 2875799 2539717 8423986 7540117 8929361 16862161 17060358 17038534 17293864 17071630 17234637 17389762 17873874 17873877 18299399
23776197	Genome-wide association study identifies ephrin type A receptors implicated in paclitaxel induced peripheral sensory neuropathy.	Peripheral neuropathy is the dose limiting toxicity of paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug widely used to treat solid tumours. This toxicity exhibits great inter-individual variability of unknown origin. The present study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with paclitaxel induced neuropathy via a whole genome approach.	
23793441	Parkinson disease loci in the mid-western Amish.	Previous evidence has shown that Parkinson disease (PD) has a heritable component, but only a small proportion of the total genetic contribution to PD has been identified. Genetic heterogeneity complicates the verification of proposed PD genes and the identification of new PD susceptibility genes. Our approach to overcome the problem of heterogeneity is to study a population isolate, the mid-western Amish communities of Indiana and Ohio. We performed genome-wide association and linkage analyses on 798 individuals (31 with PD), who are part of a 4,998 member pedigree. Through these analyses, we identified a region on chromosome 5q31.3 that shows evidence of association (p value < 1 × 10(-4)) and linkage (multipoint HLOD = 3.77). We also found further evidence of linkage on chromosomes 6 and 10 (multipoint HLOD 4.02 and 4.35 respectively). These data suggest that locus heterogeneity, even within the Amish, may be more extensive than previously appreciated.	 12058349 22881374 12761037 12777365 12888984 14639662 15177059 6846631 8710059 9197268 9484345 9923759 15591275 15377505 15726250 16093727 15785861 16252231 16736031 17420321 17668381 17605797 18373838 18366718 18301450 18505419 21292315 21473985 21488853 11710888 11731797 11875758 21738488 21876681 22266892 22315721 22438815 12402251
23793025	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new susceptibility loci for migraine.	Migraine is the most common brain disorder, affecting approximately 14% of the adult population, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We report the results of a meta-analysis across 29 genome-wide association studies, including a total of 23,285 individuals with migraine (cases) and 95,425 population-matched controls. We identified 12 loci associated with migraine susceptibility (P<5×10(-8)). Five loci are new: near AJAP1 at 1p36, near TSPAN2 at 1p13, within FHL5 at 6q16, within C7orf10 at 7p14 and near MMP16 at 8q21. Three of these loci were identified in disease subgroup analyses. Brain tissue expression quantitative trait locus analysis suggests potential functional candidate genes at four loci: APOA1BP, TBC1D7, FUT9, STAT6 and ATP5B.	 14979299 15107502 15235604 15456862 2141668 7663209 17344885 17267690 17943122 18202122 18988837 18926513 19109909 11046156 11134512 12420314 12538238 12626397 14736862 14645246 19104045 19153576 19198609 20634204 20802479 21058334 21104887 21249183 21329690 21666692 21448238 21768085 22025054 22310065 19211836 19458237 19474294 19543373 19557189 19861375 20573900 20509871 20714348 22504638 22311207 22683712 22795129 22955989 22955617 23000574 23055518
23817571	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies ten loci influencing allergic sensitization.	Allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (present in allergic sensitization) has a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. We performed the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of allergic sensitization in 5,789 affected individuals and 10,056 controls and followed up the top SNP at each of 26 loci in 6,114 affected individuals and 9,920 controls. We increased the number of susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant association with allergic sensitization from three to ten, including SNPs in or near TLR6, C11orf30, STAT6, SLC25A46, HLA-DQB1, IL1RL1, LPP, MYC, IL2 and HLA-B. All the top SNPs were associated with allergic symptoms in an independent study. Risk-associated variants at these ten loci were estimated to account for at least 25% of allergic sensitization and allergic rhinitis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations may provide new insights into the etiology of allergic disease. 	 18301422 21281963 21833088 21297633 7570428 21349911 16064138 18314482 11665340 12021781 22036096 18344981 22081985 22692066 18547625 20860503 21102463 21505031 21039600 20502693 19557189 18587394 22446964 22909159 18505431 20953190 15201134 21907864 18805339 18467348 20634204 17083348 23817569 18194563 20002472 19349984 20714348 16333313 19198610 22492648 15131563 15024131 22197932
23817570	A genome-wide association study identifies two new cervical cancer susceptibility loci at 4q12 and 17q12.	To identify new genetic risk factors for cervical cancer, we conducted a genome-wide association study in the Han Chinese population. The initial discovery set included 1,364 individuals with cervical cancer (cases) and 3,028 female controls, and we selected a 'stringently matched samples' subset (829 cases and 990 controls) from the discovery set on the basis of principal component analysis; the follow-up stages included two independent sample sets (1,824 cases and 3,808 controls for follow-up 1 and 2,343 cases and 3,388 controls for follow-up 2). We identified strong evidence of associations between cervical cancer and two new loci: 4q12 (rs13117307, Pcombined, stringently matched=9.69×10(-9), per-allele odds ratio (OR)stringently matched=1.26) and 17q12 (rs8067378, Pcombined, stringently matched=2.00×10(-8), per-allele ORstringently matched=1.18). We additionally replicated an association between HLA-DPB1 and HLA-DPB2 (HLA-DPB1/2) at 6p21.32 and cervical cancer (rs4282438, Pcombined, stringently matched=4.52×10(-27), per-allele ORstringently matched=0.75). Our findings provide new insights into the genetic etiology of cervical cancer.	 16237100 17463246 8382557 17483251 22665230 15574788 17471240 17350798 16862161 15753008 17086175 19776740 15761078 12365959 10393966 17572673 19885391 11072236 21143920 21716314 18633457 10451482 21471563 18852200 9459645 16354752 16760313 15740637 12044010 15052270 12845680 16998491 16826234 13655060 19800648 10793105 17701901 18204446 18038310 11744922 22534017
23817569	A genome-wide association meta-analysis of self-reported allergy identifies shared and allergy-specific susceptibility loci.	Allergic disease is very common and carries substantial public-health burdens. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide associations with self-reported cat, dust-mite and pollen allergies in 53,862 individuals. We used generalized estimating equations to model shared and allergy-specific genetic effects. We identified 16 shared susceptibility loci with association P<5×10(-8), including 8 loci previously associated with asthma, as well as 4p14 near TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 (rs2101521, P=5.3×10(-21)); 6p21.33 near HLA-C and MICA (rs9266772, P=3.2×10(-12)); 5p13.1 near PTGER4 (rs7720838, P=8.2×10(-11)); 2q33.1 in PLCL1 (rs10497813, P=6.1×10(-10)), 3q28 in LPP (rs9860547, P=1.2×10(-9)); 20q13.2 in NFATC2 (rs6021270, P=6.9×10(-9)), 4q27 in ADAD1 (rs17388568, P=3.9×10(-8)); and 14q21.1 near FOXA1 and TTC6 (rs1998359, P=4.8×10(-8)). We identified one locus with substantial evidence of differences in effects across allergies at 6p21.32 in the class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs17533090, P=1.7×10(-12)), which was strongly associated with cat allergy. Our study sheds new light on the shared etiology of immune and autoimmune disease.	 22820512 22955616 22507742 23817571 10943631 12111919 9190109 9209810 10426993 10490661 15644334 15668254 16083793 16381938 16890764 17447842 17701901 17924348 17943122 12594267 12740571 12930761 15024131 15007351 15266299 8087654 7570428 18301422 18361712 18361713 18311140 18329088 18547625 18855540 19135237 19349984 19426955 19465928 19474294 19628779 21829393 20981092 21058334 21102463 21051598 21094521 21297633 21516110 21625490 21666691 21743469 20032318 20190752 20103781 20410501 20502693 20585627 20616382 20860503 20953190 21804548 21804549 21907864 22036096 22064851 22197932 22509285 22592383 22317750
23749187	Identification of multiple risk variants for ankylosing spondylitis through high-density genotyping of immune-related loci.	Ankylosing spondylitis is a common, highly heritable inflammatory arthritis affecting primarily the spine and pelvis. In addition to HLA-B*27 alleles, 12 loci have previously been identified that are associated with ankylosing spondylitis in populations of European ancestry, and 2 associated loci have been identified in Asians. In this study, we used the Illumina Immunochip microarray to perform a case-control association study involving 10,619 individuals with ankylosing spondylitis (cases) and 15,145 controls. We identified 13 new risk loci and 12 additional ankylosing spondylitis-associated haplotypes at 11 loci. Two ankylosing spondylitis-associated regions have now been identified encoding four aminopeptidases that are involved in peptide processing before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation. Protective variants at two of these loci are associated both with reduced aminopeptidase function and with MHC class I cell surface expression. 	 19653082 19707191 20045101 20062062 20118929 19433412 20354512 20399120 20461780 20622878 20622879 20634204 11053066 12370345 14605368 7194916 6231933 8524815 9336417 15908954 16320356 16648838 17243956 17554300 17350674 17701901 17665420 17952073 18289738 18464913 18635804 19139168 19561590 19293837 20976248 20798335 20953190 20981092 21072187 21058334 20953163 21102463 21152001 21242517 21743469 21833088 21719416 21907864 21892150 21345260 21689402 22057235 22138694 22272576 22345646 22144400 22445881 22500001 22685289 22837489 22801493 22955616 22676399 23161489 23263488 19877036

23830517	Identification of multiple genetic susceptibility loci in Takayasu arteritis.	Takayasu arteritis is a rare inflammatory disease of large arteries. The etiology of Takayasu arteritis remains poorly understood, but genetic contribution to the disease pathogenesis is supported by the genetic association with HLA-B*52. We genotyped ~200,000 genetic variants in two ethnically divergent Takayasu arteritis cohorts from Turkey and North America by using a custom-designed genotyping platform (Immunochip). Additional genetic variants and the classical HLA alleles were imputed and analyzed. We identified and confirmed two independent susceptibility loci within the HLA region (r(2) < 0.2): HLA-B/MICA (rs12524487, OR = 3.29, p = 5.57 × 10(-16)) and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DRB1 (rs113452171, OR = 2.34, p = 3.74 × 10(-9); and rs189754752, OR = 2.47, p = 4.22 × 10(-9)). In addition, we identified and confirmed a genetic association between Takayasu arteritis and the FCGR2A/FCGR3A locus on chromosome 1 (rs10919543, OR = 1.81, p = 5.89 × 10(-12)). The risk allele in this locus results in increased mRNA expression of FCGR2A. We also established the genetic association between IL12B and Takayasu arteritis (rs56167332, OR = 1.54, p = 2.18 × 10(-8)).	 15245373 12785027 1975175 1360956 1360975 8839810 9951810 9951811 9951812 15297300 16862161 17002904 16846526 17428358 17701901 19026150 19543373 19593227 19915573 20062062 20228799 20702402 20981092 21297633 21300701 22309845 22328740 22905864 23396137 11838591 12101189 12746644 2858047
23829686	Rank-based genome-wide analysis reveals the association of ryanodine receptor-2 gene variants with childhood asthma among human populations.	The standard approach to determine unique or shared genetic factors across populations is to identify risk alleles in one population and investigate replication in others. However, since populations differ in DNA sequence information, allele frequencies, effect sizes, and linkage disequilibrium patterns, SNP association using a uniform stringent threshold on p values may not be reproducible across populations. Here, we developed rank-based methods to investigate shared or population-specific loci and pathways for childhood asthma across individuals of diverse ancestry. We performed genome-wide association studies on 859,790 SNPs genotyped in 527 affected offspring trios of European, African, and Hispanic ancestry using publically available asthma database in the Genotypes and Phenotypes database.	 18987709 16199517 12843991 17431098 21439368 18682798 20132818 22384356 21297068 19038052 15749913 19539887 18414509 22286170 21211649 16510572 21804549 15894801 17367534 15851675 21386754 20522248 19407144 17234637 17966091 21461244 19906679 17548604 16222700 20635317 20816195 9090385 20400458 11134477 12808457 19584899 19414679 18418437 8447318 18077471 21387019 15112230 19426955 22125219 15994189 20027299 21912604 20638111 19252133 21401738 14586638 19812666 11734623 8806074 12836664 16997136 17701901 17554299 20074509 19306108 21029852 19192285 20560206 14592808 22251874 17947969 18846210 18292342 10802651 15336972 19581591
23836780	Genome-wide association study of intraocular pressure identifies the GLCCI1/ICA1 region as a glaucoma susceptibility locus.	To discover quantitative trait loci for intraocular pressure, a major risk factor for glaucoma and the only modifiable one, we performed a genome-wide association study on a discovery cohort of 2175 individuals from Sydney, Australia. We found a novel association between intraocular pressure and a common variant at 7p21 near to GLCCI1 and ICA1. The findings in this region were confirmed through two UK replication cohorts totalling 4866 individuals (rs59072263, P(combined) = 1.10 × 10(-8)). A copy of the G allele at this SNP is associated with an increase in mean IOP of 0.45 mmHg (95%CI = 0.30-0.61 mmHg). These results lend support to the implication of vesicle trafficking and glucocorticoid inducibility pathways in the determination of intraocular pressure and in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma.	 10599661 10865135 11024415 561563 6903112 7318492 6349332 2888454 3310339 3310341 3390051 2913813 3067743 2306441 1985490 1987954 2016141 1867550 1736869 1454314 1286041 8334392 8162706 8188062 7758820 8874440 9005853 9097791 9176893 9780094 10466767 14283013 15640920 15939473 16186355 16303931 16488940 12049574 12365904 12383988 14691154 17325158 17572673 17652737 17690259 17628686 18187231 18653607 19543373 19812545 20237253 20363506 20835238 20981092 20517342 21453963 21532571 21833088 21991891 21345260 22057162 22173078 22570627 22796305 23426682 5635901 5487439 16860270 16877390 17254428
23834954	Genome-wide association study of sensory disturbances in the inferior alveolar nerve after bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy.	Bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) is a common orthognatic surgical procedure. Sensory disturbances in the inferior alveolar nerve, including hypoesthesia and dysesthesia, are frequently observed after BSSRO, even without distinct nerve injury. The mechanisms that underlie individual differences in the vulnerability to sensory disturbances have not yet been elucidated.	 12486606 23183491 14624855 15275783 15170388 1235985 6656869 8199140 7775756 9881784 9927905 15537663 15297300 15862471 16255080 16800000 17554300 17695343 17701901 17943122 17988628 18319075 18632209 20950786 21029238 21564555 22426309 22401740 22843789 12749963
23874384	Genetics of callous-unemotional behavior in children.	Callous-unemotional behavior (CU) is currently under consideration as a subtyping index for conduct disorder diagnosis. Twin studies routinely estimate the heritability of CU as greater than 50%. It is now possible to estimate genetic influence using DNA alone from samples of unrelated individuals, not relying on the assumptions of the twin method. Here we use this new DNA method (implemented in a software package called Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, GCTA) for the first time to estimate genetic influence on CU. We also report the first genome-wide association (GWA) study of CU as a quantitative trait. We compare these DNA results to those from twin analyses using the same measure and the same community sample of 2,930 children rated by their teachers at ages 7, 9 and 12. GCTA estimates of heritability were near zero, even though twin analysis of CU in this sample confirmed the high heritability of CU reported in the literature, and even though GCTA estimates of heritability were substantial for cognitive and anthropological traits in this sample. No significant associations were found in GWA analysis, which, like GCTA, only detects additive effects of common DNA variants. The phrase 'missing heritability' was coined to refer to the gap between variance associated with DNA variants identified in GWA studies versus twin study heritability. However, GCTA heritability, not twin study heritability, is the ceiling for GWA studies because both GCTA and GWA are limited to the overall additive effects of common DNA variants, whereas twin studies are not. This GCTA ceiling is very low for CU in our study, despite its high twin study heritability estimate. The gap between GCTA and twin study heritabilities will make it challenging to identify genes responsible for the heritability of CU. 	 18987709 11315092 15058379 17470941 22781866 15716906 11383963 20562875 9255702 22003128 23258944 15761122 21552263 12499305 19915572 17539369 22294460 17949693 21410472 22344220 18923070 20610135 18300295 18454194 17572673 18729612 16569698 22251874 18398418 21376301 22821350 17661895 17995572 23012269 19825260 21557742 22520966 22372486 17554300 20039995 21341879 20677849 20634204 22116980 17324026 23501967 21763486 22832902 17641165 10188709 21167468 22469254 15877765 20234392 22243964 19571811 18281412 19543373 19829167 12661884 22868935 20345837
23850713	Genome-wide association study of Crohn's disease in Koreans revealed three new susceptibility loci and common attributes of genetic susceptibility across ethnic populations.	Crohn's disease (CD) is an intractable inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of unknown cause.

23857890	Genome-wide association analysis accounting for environmental factors through propensity-score matching: application to stressful live events in major depressive disorder.	Stressful life events are an established trigger for depression and may contribute to the heterogeneity within genome-wide association analyses. With depression cases showing an excess of exposure to stressful events compared to controls, there is difficulty in distinguishing between "true" cases and a "normal" response to a stressful environment. This potential contamination of cases, and that from genetically at risk controls that have not yet experienced environmental triggers for onset, may reduce the power of studies to detect causal variants. In the RADIANT sample of 3,690 European individuals, we used propensity score matching to pair cases and controls on exposure to stressful life events. In 805 case-control pairs matched on stressful life event, we tested the influence of 457,670 common genetic variants on the propensity to depression under comparable level of adversity with a sign test. While this analysis produced no significant findings after genome-wide correction for multiple testing, we outline a novel methodology and perspective for providing environmental context in genetic studies. We recommend contextualizing depression by incorporating environmental exposure into genome-wide analyses as a complementary approach to testing gene-environment interactions. Possible explanations for negative findings include a lack of statistical power due to small sample size and conditional effects, resulting from the low rate of adequate matching. Our findings underscore the importance of collecting information on environmental risk factors in studies of depression and other complex phenotypes, so that sufficient sample sizes are available to investigate their effect in genome-wide association analysis.

23872634	Common variants at SCN5A-SCN10A and HEY2 are associated with Brugada syndrome, a rare disease with high risk of sudden cardiac death.	Brugada syndrome is a rare cardiac arrhythmia disorder, causally related to SCN5A mutations in around 20% of cases. Through a genome-wide association study of 312 individuals with Brugada syndrome and 1,115 controls, we detected 2 significant association signals at the SCN10A locus (rs10428132) and near the HEY2 gene (rs9388451). Independent replication confirmed both signals (meta-analyses: rs10428132, P = 1.0 × 10(-68); rs9388451, P = 5.1 × 10(-17)) and identified one additional signal in SCN5A (at 3p21; rs11708996, P = 1.0 × 10(-14)). The cumulative effect of the three loci on disease susceptibility was unexpectedly large (Ptrend = 6.1 × 10(-81)). The association signals at SCN5A-SCN10A demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms modulating cardiac conduction can also influence susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. The implication of association with HEY2, supported by new evidence that Hey2 regulates cardiac electrical activity, shows that Brugada syndrome may originate from altered transcriptional programming during cardiac development. Altogether, our findings indicate that common genetic variation can have a strong impact on the predisposition to rare diseases. 	 21126620 22723301 12111919 22384356 22248531 19151714 12922017 8927780 15019016 17145985 22138821 12454287 1309182 22728936 22723299 17572673 8538791 20616382 9521325 20639392 11076825 20062061 20659475 22327514 18600404 16648850 20195508 17293876 20031603 19255801 17332425 19812666 15297376 17468400 20062060 21403098 19305409 14961552 11971969 20031634 17701901 20129283 22840528 15502828 22706305 21076409 20062063 12478833 12372253 10415358 20110552 19305408 15655131 16199874 22820511
23886662	A genome-wide association study of atopic dermatitis identifies loci with overlapping effects on asthma and psoriasis.	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common dermatological disease of childhood. Many children with AD have asthma and AD shares regions of genetic linkage with psoriasis, another chronic inflammatory skin disease. We present here a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of childhood-onset AD in 1563 European cases with known asthma status and 4054 European controls. Using Illumina genotyping followed by imputation, we generated 268 034 consensus genotypes and in excess of 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for analysis. Association signals were assessed for replication in a second panel of 2286 European cases and 3160 European controls. Four loci achieved genome-wide significance for AD and replicated consistently across all cohorts. These included the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1, the genomic region proximal to LRRC32 on chromosome 11, the RAD50/IL13 locus on chromosome 5 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6; reflecting action of classical HLA alleles. We observed variation in the contribution towards co-morbid asthma for these regions of association. We further explored the genetic relationship between AD, asthma and psoriasis by examining previously identified susceptibility SNPs for these diseases. We found considerable overlap between AD and psoriasis together with variable coincidence between allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of AD incorporates immune and epidermal barrier defects with combinations of specific and overlapping effects at individual loci.	 18179884 18385500 18396323 18364390 18846228 18677311 19169254 19169255 21792231 15005725 22174698 22197932 22455414 22521419 22914434 20953189 20953190 21058334 21300701 21388665 21419481 21666691 21596858 21814517 21804548 21804549 21907864 21742059 21991953 22036096 15245541 5056734 6538209 3760273 3662604 2252253 2093354 2060393 8496415 8496614 7918017 7796298 8630732 9404559 9653015 15711639 16155052 23042114 23066157 23143594 23345460 11279517 11397944 12653713 12688617 14657842 19198610 19349984 19426955 19501237 19589816 19715440 19541915 20032318 20037589 20860503 20876104 20953186 20953188 16444271 16550169 16998491 17236132 17299430 17215318 17301831 17611496 18034971 18058064
23935489	Association study of common genetic variants and HIV-1 acquisition in 6,300 infected cases and 7,200 controls.	Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in HIV-1 infected individuals, identifying common genetic influences on viral control and disease course. Similarly, common genetic correlates of acquisition of HIV-1 after exposure have been interrogated using GWAS, although in generally small samples. Under the auspices of the International Collaboration for the Genomics of HIV, we have combined the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data collected by 25 cohorts, studies, or institutions on HIV-1 infected individuals and compared them to carefully matched population-level data sets (a list of all collaborators appears in Note S1 in Text S1). After imputation using the 1,000 Genomes Project reference panel, we tested approximately 8 million common DNA variants (SNPs and indels) for association with HIV-1 acquisition in 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population samples of European ancestry. Initial association testing identified the SNP rs4418214, the C allele of which is known to tag the HLA-B*57:01 and B*27:05 alleles, as genome-wide significant (p = 3.6 × 10⁻¹¹). However, restricting analysis to individuals with a known date of seroconversion suggested that this association was due to the frailty bias in studies of lethal diseases. Further analyses including testing recessive genetic models, testing for bulk effects of non-genome-wide significant variants, stratifying by sexual or parenteral transmission risk and testing previously reported associations showed no evidence for genetic influence on HIV-1 acquisition (with the exception of CCR5Δ32 homozygosity). Thus, these data suggest that genetic influences on HIV acquisition are either rare or have smaller effects than can be detected by this sample size.	 21160409 8791590 21107268 19107206 20041166 22915813 22174851 17502719 20487506 22718199 16738942 10731151 21811574 22138821 17572673 12374865 16887163 22820512 18499582 11121048 21051598 20064070 19200528 22363001 22362864 12114533 16123114 17590083 19754311 17701901 14571188 17197814 16401428 23372042 17641165 20360734 20843824 19571811 20887229 16177829 19115949 20205591 20220841 12446984

23900074	A genome-wide association scan (GWAS) for mean telomere length within the COGS project: identified loci show little association with hormone-related cancer risk.	Mean telomere length (TL) in blood cells is heritable and has been reported to be associated with risks of several diseases, including cancer. We conducted a meta-analysis of three GWAS for TL (total n=2240) and selected 1629 variants for replication via the "iCOGS" custom genotyping array. All ∼200 000 iCOGS variants were analysed with TL, and those displaying associations in healthy controls (n = 15 065) were further tested in breast cancer cases (n = 11 024). We found a novel TL association (Ptrend < 4 × 10(-10)) at 3p14.4 close to PXK and evidence (Ptrend < 7 × 10(-7)) for TL loci at 6p22.1 (ZNF311) and 20q11.2 (BCL2L1). We additionally confirmed (Ptrend < 5 × 10(-14)) the previously reported loci at 3q26.2 (TERC), 5p15.3 (TERT) and 10q24.3 (OBFC1) and found supportive evidence (Ptrend < 5 × 10(-4)) for the published loci at 2p16.2 (ACYP2), 4q32.2 (NAF1) and 20q13.3 (RTEL1). SNPs tagging these loci explain TL differences of up to 731 bp (corresponding to 18% of total TL in healthy individuals), however, they display little direct evidence for association with breast, ovarian or prostate cancer risks. 	 23128226 22563304 23535729 23535730 23535731 12000852 12364308 12689998 15065663 3413114 2342578 1722017 1613801 1438199 7977349 15970922 16400618 17084054 17416776 17623782 18971492 19151717 19089916 19129229 19293310 19289618 19578363 19661087 20056955 20139977 20395204 20421499 20543847 23535732 23535734 23544012 23544013 23468462 23535824 20570912 21285406 21573004 21467229 22199369 23001564
23935956	Genome wide association analysis of a founder population identified TAF3 as a gene for MCHC in humans.	The red blood cell related traits are highly heritable but their genetics are poorly defined. Only 5-10% of the total observed variance is explained by the genetic loci found to date, suggesting that additional loci should be searched using approaches alternative to large meta analysis. GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study) for red blood cell traits in a founder population cohort from Northern Italy identified a new locus for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in the TAF3 gene. The association was replicated in two cohorts (rs1887582, P = 4.25E-09). TAF3 encodes a transcription cofactor that participates in core promoter recognition complex, and is involved in zebrafish and mouse erythropoiesis. We show here that TAF3 is required for transcription of the SPTA1 gene, encoding alpha spectrin, one of the proteins that link the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in SPTA1 are responsible for hereditary spherocytosis, a monogenic disorder of MCHC, as well as for the normal MCHC level. Based on our results, we propose that TAF3 is required for normal erythropoiesis in human and that it might have a role in controlling the ratio between hemoglobin (Hb) and cell volume and in the dynamics of RBC maturation in healthy individuals. Finally, TAF3 represents a potential candidate or a modifier gene for disorders of red cell membrane. 	 17384015 16472893 18341630 18603552 19060910 19777587 19812666 19847309 19820697 19862010 20139978 19682982 21059904 22713810 23222517 10951523 11438666 15172676 265555 7795242 16189263 16582909 17884155
23910658	Identification of regions associated with variation in sensitivity to food-related odors in the human genome.	Humans vary in their ability to smell numerous odors [1-3], including those associated with food [4-6]. Odor sensitivity is heritable [7-11], with examples linking genetic variation for sensitivity to specific odors typically located near olfactory receptor (OR) genes [12-16]. However, with thousands of aromas and few deorphaned ORs [17, 18], there has been little progress toward linking variation at OR loci to odor sensitivity [19, 20]. We hypothesized that OR genes contain the variation that explains much of the differences in sensitivity for odors, paralleling the genetics of taste [21, 22], which affect the flavor experience of foods [23-25]. We employed a genome-wide association approach for ten food-related odors and identified genetic associations to sensitivity for 2-heptanone (p = 5.1 × 10(-8)), isobutyraldehyde (p = 6.4 × 10(-10)), β-damascenone (p = 1.6 × 10(-7)), and β-ionone (p = 1.4 × 10(-31)). Each locus is located in/near distinct clusters of OR genes. These findings increase the number of olfactory sensitivity loci to nine and demonstrate the importance of OR-associated variation in sensory acuity for food-related odors. Analysis of genotype frequencies across human populations implies that variation in sensitivity for these odors is widespread. Furthermore, each participant possessed one of many possible combinations of sensitivities for these odors, supporting the notion that everyone experiences their own unique "flavor world."	
23903356	Identification of HKDC1 and BACE2 as genes influencing glycemic traits during pregnancy through genome-wide association studies.	Maternal metabolism during pregnancy impacts the developing fetus, affecting offspring birth weight and adiposity. This has important implications for metabolic health later in life (e.g., offspring of mothers with pre-existing or gestational diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of metabolic disorders in childhood). To identify genetic loci associated with measures of maternal metabolism obtained during an oral glucose tolerance test at ∼28 weeks' gestation, we performed a genome-wide association study of 4,437 pregnant mothers of European (n = 1,367), Thai (n = 1,178), Afro-Caribbean (n = 1,075), and Hispanic (n = 817) ancestry, along with replication of top signals in three additional European ancestry cohorts. In addition to identifying associations with genes previously implicated with measures of glucose metabolism in nonpregnant populations, we identified two novel genome-wide significant associations: 2-h plasma glucose and HKDC1, and fasting C-peptide and BACE2. These results suggest that the genetic architecture underlying glucose metabolism may differ, in part, in pregnancy. 	 22955619 21805237 16862161 19060908 20718045 17943122 23029294 21907142 20864672 20487576 22325160 8585997 17572673 18604207 19060907 20686565 19936222 20581827 20616382 20682688 19200528 16443781 21935364 21300955 21873549 20534142 17519427 20483211 18521185 18556336 18463375 17982337 17982340 9704241 22885924 10749877 18651836 19002430 10931940 21658282 20943756 12113977 19324940 22233651 22885922 19060909 22581228 21423719 20081858 18008060
23903073	Genome-wide association study of the five-factor model of personality in young Korean women.	Personality is a determinant of behavior and lifestyle associated with health and human diseases. Although personality is known to be a heritable trait, its polygenic nature has made the identification of genetic variants elusive. We performed a genome-wide association study on 1089 Korean women aged 18-40 years whose personality traits were measured with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory for the five-factor model of personality. To reduce environmental factors that may influence personality traits, this study was restricted to young adult women. In the discovery phase, we identified variants of PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D) that associated this gene with the Openness domain. Other genes that were previously reported to be associated with neurological phenotypes were also associated with personality traits. In particular, DRD1 and OR1A2 were linked to Neuroticism, NKAIN2 with Extraversion, HTR5A with Openness and DRD3 with Agreeableness. Data from our replication study of 2090 subjects confirmed the association between OR1A2 and Neuroticism. We first identified and confirmed a novel region on OR1A2 associated with Neuroticism [corrected]. Candidate genes for psychiatric disorders were also enriched. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic architecture of personality traits and provide critical clues to the neurobiological mechanisms that influence them.	
23936387	A possible mechanism behind autoimmune disorders discovered by genome-wide linkage and association analysis in celiac disease.	Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by an intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten, a storage protein found in wheat, rye and barley. Similar to other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease is the result of an immune response to self-antigens leading to tissue destruction and production of autoantibodies. Common diseases like celiac disease have a complex pattern of inheritance with inputs from both environmental as well as additive and non-additive genetic factors. In the past few years, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been successful in finding genetic risk variants behind many common diseases and traits. To complement and add to the previous findings, we performed a GWAS including 206 trios from 97 nuclear Swedish and Norwegian families affected with celiac disease. By stratifying for HLA-DQ, we identified a new genome-wide significant risk locus covering the DUSP10 gene. To further investigate the associations from the GWAS we performed pathway analyses and two-locus interaction analyses. These analyses showed an over-representation of genes involved in type 2 diabetes and identified a set of candidate mechanisms and genes of which some were selected for mRNA expression analysis using small intestinal biopsies from 98 patients. Several genes were expressed differently in the small intestinal mucosa from patients with celiac autoimmunity compared to intestinal mucosa from control patients. From top-scoring regions we identified susceptibility genes in several categories: 1) polarity and epithelial cell functionality; 2) intestinal smooth muscle; 3) growth and energy homeostasis, including proline and glutamine metabolism; and finally 4) innate and adaptive immune system. These genes and pathways, including specific functions of DUSP10, together reveal a new potential biological mechanism that could influence the genesis of celiac disease, and possibly also other chronic disorders with an inflammatory component. 	 21471446 9872982 19516192 9212111 12184808 20978232 21383967 1427023 22580835 20190752 22792442 21487011 22683306 18311140 19661063 15900004 9390290 22138694 16153302 2909659 16880273 21964062 8447318 17681939 21530659 8801636 19557189 15076637 11731797 22615405 19109420 17526521 8063033 11106728 11840196 8938902 21079607 12695487 21961813 17848569 17701901 17283437 21298027 2301392 15124925 16622416 19875614 10802651 19543373 22385244 19415679 8086596 17558408

24144296	Nine loci for ocular axial length identified through genome-wide association studies, including shared loci with refractive error.	Refractive errors are common eye disorders of public health importance worldwide. Ocular axial length (AL) is the major determinant of refraction and thus of myopia and hyperopia. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for AL, combining 12,531 Europeans and 8,216 Asians. We identified eight genome-wide significant loci for AL (RSPO1, C3orf26, LAMA2, GJD2, ZNRF3, CD55, MIP, and ALPPL2) and confirmed one previously reported AL locus (ZC3H11B). Of the nine loci, five (LAMA2, GJD2, CD55, ALPPL2, and ZC3H11B) were associated with refraction in 18 independent cohorts (n = 23,591). Differential gene expression was observed for these loci in minus-lens-induced myopia mouse experiments and human ocular tissues. Two of the AL genes, RSPO1 and ZNRF3, are involved in Wnt signaling, a pathway playing a major role in the regulation of eyeball size. This study provides evidence of shared genes between AL and refraction, but importantly also suggests that these traits may have unique pathways. 	 7993206 22133988 8105165 16303933 20719862 22507743 16101943 18263651 23291589 14628964 11773604 20835239 18289630 11980854 22344187 18552384 21532571 15008558 14711715 22922875 22507742 20825314 15611866 9097791 19933197 22064851 17365815 22685421 10939619 21149283 16032513 16032514 7444756 17572673 19424496 17478476 19763151 9224128 15845033 21791589 20630598 18695104 16111755 19433716 17254428 22575959 12958120 21877163 21621261 8366922 8855394 19880184 22665138 23396134 19995197 18455142 20598278 22003110 19059278 19122781 19803772 17003564 17898312 23401653 21058334 10547847 15054401 22955989 16996610 18400942 23385790 21185080 15623754 19875653 11734523 21490949 22045388 20851442 17205325 19543373 11328733
23933737	Genome-wide association study identifies ZFHX1B as a susceptibility locus for severe myopia.	Severe myopia (defined as spherical equivalent < -6.0 D) is a predominant problem in Asian countries, resulting in substantial morbidity. We performed a meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies (GWAS), all of East Asian descent totaling 1603 cases and 3427 controls. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs13382811 from ZFHX1B [encoding for ZEB2] and rs6469937 from SNTB1) showed highly suggestive evidence of association with disease (P < 1 × 10(-7)) and were brought forward for replication analysis in a further 1241 severe myopia cases and 3559 controls from a further three independent sample collections. Significant evidence of replication was observed, and both SNP markers surpassed the formal threshold for genome-wide significance upon meta-analysis of both discovery and replication stages (P = 5.79 × 10(-10), per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.26 for rs13382811 and P = 2.01 × 10(-9), per-allele OR = 0.79 for rs6469937). The observation at SNTB1 is confirmatory of a very recent GWAS on severe myopia. Both genes were expressed in the human retina, sclera, as well as the retinal pigmented epithelium. In an experimental mouse model for myopia, we observed significant alterations to gene and protein expression in the retina and sclera of the unilateral induced myopic eyes for Zfhx1b and Sntb1. These new data advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of severe myopia. 	
23934736	Genome-wide association study of a heart failure related metabolomic profile among African Americans in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.	Both the prevalence and incidence of heart failure (HF) are increasing, especially among African Americans, but no large-scale, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HF-related metabolites has been reported. We sought to identify novel genetic variants that are associated with metabolites previously reported to relate to HF incidence. GWASs of three metabolites identified previously as risk factors for incident HF (pyroglutamine, dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid, and X-11787, being either hydroxy-leucine or hydroxy-isoleucine) were performed in 1,260 African Americans free of HF at the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. A significant association on chromosome 5q33 (rs10463316, MAF = 0.358, P-value = 1.92 × 10(-10) ) was identified for pyroglutamine. One region on chromosome 2p13 contained a nonsynonymous substitution in N-acetyltransferase 8 (NAT8) was associated with X-11787 (rs13538, MAF = 0.481, P-value = 1.71 × 10(-23) ). The smallest P-value for dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid was rs4006531 on chromosome 8q24 (MAF = 0.400, P-value = 6.98 × 10(-7) ). None of the above SNPs were individually associated with incident HF, but a genetic risk score (GRS) created by summing the most significant risk alleles from each metabolite detected 11% greater risk of HF per allele. In summary, we identified three loci associated with previously reported HF-related metabolites. Further use of metabolomics technology will facilitate replication of these findings in independent samples. 	 11959859 15702613 9252331 15716906 16862161 12616644 9852678 20445134 15450501 19033659 2646917 16757157 10598751 9164839 9924171 18417015 21931361 20383145 20691829 17903304 18359324 23788672 21160056 22288610 20383146 21886157 20233392 18154657 17443022 21475195 21423183 11533296 9256850 16228142 8606324
23967269	A genome-wide association study of total serum and mite-specific IgEs in asthma patients.	Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is one of the central players in asthma and allergic diseases. Although the serum IgE level, a useful endophenotype, is generally increased in patients with asthma, genetic factors influencing IgE regulation in asthma are still not fully understood. To identify the genetic variations associated with total serum and mite-specific IgEs in asthmatics, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 657,366 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed in 877 Korean asthmatics. This study found that several new genes might be associated with total IgE in asthmatics, such as CRIM1 (rs848512, P = 1.18×10(-6); rs711254, P = 6.73×10(-6)), ZNF71 (rs10404342, P = 7.60×10(-6)), TLN1 (rs4879926, P = 7.74×10(-6)), and SYNPO2 (rs1472066, P = 8.36×10(-6); rs1038770, P = 8.66×10(-6)). Regarding the association of specific IgE to house dust mites, it was observed that intergenic SNPs nearby to OPRK1 and LOC730217 might be associated with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D.p.) and Dermatophagoides farinae (D.f.) in asthmatics, respectively. In further pathway analysis, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system and adherens junction pathways were estimated to play a role in the regulation of total IgE levels in asthma. Although functional evaluations and replications of these results in other populations are needed, this GWAS of serum IgE in asthmatics could facilitate improved understanding of the role of the newly identified genetic variants in asthma and its related phenotypes. 	 21966603 8880106 19326507 16862161 21958117 19293820 19624525 11806842 22075330 18340359 17174732 17503328 11023809 18846228 19264973 15073379 18274559 16415888 23491407 20860503 22081090 19574333 17059361 15958078 16470226 15007352 17785539 18303010 19339519 22070912 1891008 23146381 2513574 19672052 16461126 19016802 12417883 8765832 1897816 22070913 2911321 18301424
23937595	A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes in an extended Arab family.	Twenty percent of people aged 20 to 79 have type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes for T2D have not been reported for Arab countries. We performed a discovery GWAS in an extended UAE family (N=178; 66 diabetic; 112 healthy) genotyped on the Illumina Human 660 Quad Beadchip, with independent replication of top hits in 116 cases and 199 controls. Power to achieve genome-wide significance (commonly P=5×10(-8)) was therefore limited. Nevertheless, transmission disequilibrium testing in FBAT identified top hits at Chromosome 4p12-p13 (KCTD8: rs4407541, P=9.70×10(-6); GABRB1: rs10517178/rs1372491, P=4.19×10(-6)) and 14q13 (PRKD1: rs10144903, 3.92×10(-6)), supported by analysis using a linear mixed model approximation in GenABEL (4p12-p13 GABRG1/GABRA2: rs7662743, Padj-agesex=2.06×10(-5); KCTD8: rs4407541, Padj-agesex=1.42×10(-4); GABRB1: rs10517178/rs1372491, Padj-agesex=0.027; 14q13 PRKD1: rs10144903, Padj-agesex=6.95×10(-5)). SNPs across GABRG1/GABRA2 did not replicate, whereas more proximal SNPs rs7679715 (Padj-agesex=0.030) and rs2055942 (Padj-agesex=0.022) at COX7B2/GABRA4 did, in addition to a trend distally at KCTD8 (rs4695718: Padj-agesex=0.096). Modelling of discovery and replication data support independent signals at GABRA4 (rs2055942: Padj-agesex-combined=3×10(-4)) and at KCTD8 (rs4695718: Padj-agesex-combined=2×10(-4)). Replication was observed for PRKD1 rs1953722 (proxy for rs10144903; Padj-agesex=0.031; Padj-agesex-combined=2×10(-4)). These genes may provide important functional leads in understanding disease pathogenesis in this population.	
23945395	Genome-wide association study identifies three novel loci for type 2 diabetes.	Although over 60 loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified, there still remains a large genetic component to be clarified. To explore unidentified loci for T2D, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 6 209 637 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were directly genotyped or imputed using East Asian references from the 1000 Genomes Project (June 2011 release) in 5976 Japanese patients with T2D and 20 829 nondiabetic individuals. Nineteen unreported loci were selected and taken forward to follow-up analyses. Combined discovery and follow-up analyses (30 392 cases and 34 814 controls) identified three new loci with genome-wide significance, which were MIR129-LEP [rs791595; risk allele = A; risk allele frequency (RAF) = 0.080; P = 2.55 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.17], GPSM1 [rs11787792; risk allele = A; RAF = 0.874; P = 1.74 × 10(-10); OR = 1.15] and SLC16A13 (rs312457; risk allele = G; RAF = 0.078; P = 7.69 × 10(-13); OR = 1.20). This study demonstrates that GWASs based on the imputation of genotypes using modern reference haplotypes such as that from the 1000 Genomes Project data can assist in identification of new loci for common diseases. 	
23942779	A genome-wide association study of behavioral disinhibition.	We report results from a genome wide association study (GWAS) of five quantitative indicators of behavioral disinhibition: nicotine, alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, illicit drugs, and non-substance related behavioral disinhibition. The sample, consisting of 7,188 Caucasian individuals clustered in 2,300 nuclear families, was genotyped on over 520,000 SNP markers from Illumina's Human 660W-Quad Array. Analysis of individual SNP associations revealed only one marker-component phenotype association, between rs1868152 and illicit drugs, with a p value below the standard genome-wide threshold of 5 × 10(-8). Because we had analyzed five separate phenotypes, we do not consider this single association to be significant. However, we report 13 SNPs that were associated at p < 10(-5) for one phenotype and p < 10(-3) for at least two other phenotypes, which are potential candidates for future investigations of variants associated with general behavioral disinhibition. Biometric analysis of the twin and family data yielded estimates of additive heritability for the component phenotypes ranging from 49 to 70%, GCTA estimates of heritability for the same phenotypes ranged from 8 to 37%. Consequently, even though the common variants genotyped on the GWAS array appear in aggregate to account for a sizable proportion of heritable effects in multiple indicators of behavioral disinhibition, our data suggest that most of the additive heritability remains "missing".	 15351771 23363460 11068968 11386990 12150417 12963675 7384345 9093895 10530634 16557364 16862161 16952998 16894595 16622805 17346679 17554300 17564500 17567401 18316677 18370620 18384978 18477577 19381300 19487630 19812666 19644963 20418888 20562875 20598278 20452571 20700436 20881960 20935630 21142928 21167468 21474944 20351714 21314694 21521612 21471458 21153693 20585324 21826061 22243964 21906199 21854684 22344220 22253303 22492059 22832902 11054778

23966867	Genome-wide association of body fat distribution in African ancestry populations suggests new loci.	Central obesity, measured by waist circumference (WC) or waist-hip ratio (WHR), is a marker of body fat distribution. Although obesity disproportionately affects minority populations, few studies have conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) of fat distribution among those of predominantly African ancestry (AA). We performed GWAS of WC and WHR, adjusted and unadjusted for BMI, in up to 33,591 and 27,350 AA individuals, respectively. We identified loci associated with fat distribution in AA individuals using meta-analyses of GWA results for WC and WHR (stage 1). Overall, 25 SNPs with single genomic control (GC)-corrected p-values<5.0 × 10(-6) were followed-up (stage 2) in AA with WC and with WHR. Additionally, we interrogated genomic regions of previously identified European ancestry (EA) WHR loci among AA. In joint analysis of association results including both Stage 1 and 2 cohorts, 2 SNPs demonstrated association, rs2075064 at LHX2, p = 2.24×10(-8) for WC-adjusted-for-BMI, and rs6931262 at RREB1, p = 2.48×10(-8) for WHR-adjusted-for-BMI. However, neither signal was genome-wide significant after double GC-correction (LHX2: p = 6.5 × 10(-8); RREB1: p = 5.7 × 10(-8)). Six of fourteen previously reported loci for waist in EA populations were significant (p<0.05 divided by the number of independent SNPs within the region) in AA studied here (TBX15-WARS2, GRB14, ADAMTS9, LY86, RSPO3, ITPR2-SSPN). Further, we observed associations with metabolic traits: rs13389219 at GRB14 associated with HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting insulin, and rs13060013 at ADAMTS9 with HDL-cholesterol and fasting insulin. Finally, we observed nominal evidence for sexual dimorphism, with stronger results in AA women at the GRB14 locus (p for interaction = 0.02). In conclusion, we identified two suggestive loci associated with fat distribution in AA populations in addition to confirming 6 loci previously identified in populations of EA. These findings reinforce the concept that there are fat distribution loci that are independent of generalized adiposity.	 23583978 11315092 22893027 14569048 23208300 21706003 12782898 9845227 16773560 15699228 21931561 12181381 4043554 20881960 18604207 21798870 20935630 20935629 18568023 20231497 2228394 10904454 20017971 19165157 19802870 17694296 21703425 18431502 19005195 10375046 22589738 21437273 22589742 21347282 20843952 18830075 22547425 9725630 22057235 21407268 6350364 20884846 20071471 19215730 21423719 12788850
23955597	Common variation at 3q26.2, 6p21.33, 17p11.2 and 22q13.1 influences multiple myeloma risk.	To identify variants for multiple myeloma risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study with validation in additional series totaling 4,692 individuals with multiple myeloma (cases) and 10,990 controls. We identified four risk loci at 3q26.2 (rs10936599, P = 8.70 × 10(-14)), 6p21.33 (rs2285803, PSORS1C2, P = 9.67 × 10(-11)), 17p11.2 (rs4273077, TNFRSF13B, P = 7.67 × 10(-9)) and 22q13.1 (rs877529, CBX7, P = 7.63 × 10(-16)). These data provide further evidence for genetic susceptibility to this B-cell hematological malignancy, as well as insight into the biological basis of predisposition. 	 22532805 17895893 21410373 15699631 16862161 12111919 20657582 21037568 18715499 12592343 20639881 15509819 21304890 16753294 12177636 21131037 19798094 17572673 17289997 15543147 20616218 12029063 16362079 18179884 20616382 15827134 16705090 22120009 16826223 22673310 23502783 16155052 19644074 17374722 20972440 21828241 17701901 16228001 21300701 21708826 18046446 21533074 3926026 19620980 11520463 20220069 16224025 12594954
23962720	A genome-wide association study and biological pathway analysis of epilepsy prognosis in a prospective cohort of newly treated epilepsy.	We present the analysis of a prospective multicentre study to investigate genetic effects on the prognosis of newly treated epilepsy. Patients with a new clinical diagnosis of epilepsy requiring medication were recruited and followed up prospectively. The clinical outcome was defined as freedom from seizures for a minimum of 12 months in accordance with the consensus statement from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). Genetic effects on remission of seizures after starting treatment were analysed with and without adjustment for significant clinical prognostic factors, and the results from each cohort were combined using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. After quality control (QC), we analysed 889 newly treated epilepsy patients using 472 450 genotyped and 6.9 × 10(6) imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Suggestive evidence for association (defined as Pmeta < 5.0 × 10(-7)) with remission of seizures after starting treatment was observed at three loci: 6p12.2 (rs492146, Pmeta = 2.1 × 10(-7), OR[G] = 0.57), 9p23 (rs72700966, Pmeta = 3.1 × 10(-7), OR[C] = 2.70) and 15q13.2 (rs143536437, Pmeta = 3.2 × 10(-7), OR[C] = 1.92). Genes of biological interest at these loci include PTPRD and ARHGAP11B (encoding functions implicated in neuronal development) and GSTA4 (a phase II biotransformation enzyme). Pathway analysis using two independent methods implicated a number of pathways in the prognosis of epilepsy, including KEGG categories 'calcium signaling pathway' and 'phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway'. Through a series of power curves, we conclude that it is unlikely any single common variant explains >4.4% of the variation in the outcome of newly treated epilepsy. 	 17463246 11315092 22881716 19539887 21899452 22346768 10856223 15499115 17382827 23223016 23468209 16983377 18346983 19763151 21320116 18278044 19546859 18852835 20517342 22949513 17382828 10660394 11117539 20196795 22286174 21428769 20512141 23072379 22116939 499118 17701901 21833088 19889013 18660810 21167468 21081654 23217325 22158332 12724000 19543373 16857572 20531469 21653640 15630019
23958962	Genome-wide association study of cocaine dependence and related traits: FAM53B identified as a risk gene.	We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for cocaine dependence (CD) in three sets of African- and European-American subjects (AAs and EAs, respectively) to identify pathways, genes and alleles important in CD risk. The discovery GWAS data set (n=5697 subjects) was genotyped using the Illumina OmniQuad microarray (8 90 000 analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)). Additional genotypes were imputed based on the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Top-ranked findings were evaluated by incorporating information from publicly available GWAS data from 4063 subjects. Then, the most significant GWAS SNPs were genotyped in 2549 independent subjects. We observed one genome-wide-significant (GWS) result: rs2629540 at the FAM53B ('family with sequence similarity 53, member B') locus. This was supported in both AAs and EAs; P-value (meta-analysis of all samples)=4.28 × 10(-8). The gene maps to the same chromosomal region as the maximum peak we observed in a previous linkage study. NCOR2 (nuclear receptor corepressor 2) SNP rs150954431 was associated with P=1.19 × 10(-9) in the EA discovery sample. SNP rs2456778, which maps to CDK1 ('cyclin-dependent kinase 1'), was associated with cocaine-induced paranoia in AAs in the discovery sample only (P=4.68 × 10(-8)). This is the first study to identify risk variants for CD using GWAS. Our results implicate novel risk loci and provide insights into potential therapeutic and prevention strategies. 	 10711912 12875050 2006696 1871133 1752853 9926041 15909294 16077740 15894433 15896927 16385453 16611694 16862161 17485608 17194218 17701901 17716221 18243582 19255376 19543373 20616382 20947769 20981092 21668797 22354695 22952603 22999924 23089632 23183491 24143882
23966204	GWAS of human bitter taste perception identifies new loci and reveals additional complexity of bitter taste genetics.	Human perception of bitterness displays pronounced interindividual variation. This phenotypic variation is mirrored by equally pronounced genetic variation in the family of bitter taste receptor genes. To better understand the effects of common genetic variations on human bitter taste perception, we conducted a genome-wide association study on a discovery panel of 504 subjects and a validation panel of 104 subjects from the general population of São Paulo in Brazil. Correction for general taste-sensitivity allowed us to identify a SNP in the cluster of bitter taste receptors on chr12 (10.88- 11.24 Mb, build 36.1) significantly associated (best SNP: rs2708377, P = 5.31 × 10(-13), r(2) = 8.9%, β = -0.12, s.e. = 0.016) with the perceived bitterness of caffeine. This association overlaps with-but is statistically distinct from-the previously identified SNP rs10772420 influencing the perception of quinine bitterness that falls in the same bitter taste cluster. We replicated this association to quinine perception (P = 4.97 × 10(-37), r(2) = 23.2%, β = 0.25, s.e. = 0.020) and additionally found the effect of this genetic locus to be concentration specific with a strong impact on the perception of low, but no impact on the perception of high concentrations of quinine. Our study, thus, furthers our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of bitter taste perception. 	 11315092 16862161 17269788 22218679 10761935 18670650 20675712 17053812 16175527 20961961 9250119 15466715 11259346 22132133 21490707 19966917 18758442 352127 17108952 12595690 21994393 21940398 20022913 19303166
23972371	Genome-wide association analysis of blood-pressure traits in African-ancestry individuals reveals common associated genes in African and non-African populations.	High blood pressure (BP) is more prevalent and contributes to more severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in African Americans than in any other United States ethnic group. Several small African-ancestry (AA) BP genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been published, but their findings have failed to replicate to date. We report on a large AA BP GWAS meta-analysis that includes 29,378 individuals from 19 discovery cohorts and subsequent replication in additional samples of AA (n = 10,386), European ancestry (EA) (n = 69,395), and East Asian ancestry (n = 19,601). Five loci (EVX1-HOXA, ULK4, RSPO3, PLEKHG1, and SOX6) reached genome-wide significance (p < 1.0 × 10(-8)) for either systolic or diastolic BP in a transethnic meta-analysis after correction for multiple testing. Three of these BP loci (EVX1-HOXA, RSPO3, and PLEKHG1) lack previous associations with BP. We also identified one independent signal in a known BP locus (SOX6) and provide evidence for fine mapping in four additional validated BP loci. We also demonstrate that validated EA BP GWAS loci, considered jointly, show significant effects in AA samples. Consequently, these findings suggest that BP loci might have universal effects across studied populations, demonstrating that multiethnic samples are an essential component in identifying, fine mapping, and understanding their trait variability. 	 22955989 22426310 22682243 22276822 22215894 22064851 22100073 21909115 21909109 21907010 21602305 21637794 21572416 21422096 21378095 21533022 20935629 19430483 22955616 10591383 11230269 12214310 12377087 12748199 2513255 15665825 16216999 16429165 16434724 16494531 16601461 16862161 17943131 18043751 18375949 18842812 18974171 19609347 19622819 20040588 19430479

23974705	A genome-wide association study of chronic otitis media with effusion and recurrent otitis media identifies a novel susceptibility locus on chromosome 2.	Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and recurrent otitis media (ROM) have been shown to be heritable, but candidate gene and linkage studies to date have been equivocal. Our aim was to identify genetic susceptibility factors using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We genotyped 602 subjects from 143 families with 373 COME/ROM subjects using the Illumina Human CNV370-Duo DNA Bead Chip (324,748 SNPs). We carried out the GWAS scan and imputed SNPs at the regions with the most significant associations. Replication genotyping in an independent family-based sample was conducted for 53 SNPs: the 41 most significant SNPs with P < 10(-4) and 12 imputed SNPs with P < 10(-4) on chromosome 15 (near the strongest signal). We replicated the association of rs10497394 (GWAS discovery P = 1.30 × 10(-5)) on chromosome 2 in the independent otitis media population (P = 4.7 × 10(-5); meta-analysis P = 1.52 × 10(-8)). Three additional SNPs had replication P values < 0.10. Two were on chromosome 15q26.1 including rs1110060, the strongest association with COME/ROM in the primary GWAS (P = 3.4 ×10(-7)) in KIF7 intron 7 (P = 0.072), and rs10775247, a non-synonymous SNP in TICRR exon 2 (P = 0.075). The third SNP rs386057 was on chromosome 5 in TPPP intron 1 (P = 0.045). We have performed the first GWAS of COME/ROM and have identified a SNP rs10497394 on chromosome 2 is significantly associated with COME/ROM susceptibility. This SNP is within a 537 kb intergenic region, bordered by CDCA7 and SP3. The genomic and functional significance of this newly identified locus in COME/ROM pathogenesis requires additional investigation. 	 17504979 12819964 22532805 20922562 21295032 22075998 12013745 21293382 9270423 2732519 21397937 22064851 17921354 8643261 17275307 8905392 20116089 19715440 16107490 19883356 21972383 19906571 18930059 18439551 20616382 16415888 16619052 18976480 15514890 15231974 15217908 23133572 23459932 22809689 18521185 2929308 15193168 19836843 10591333 21058334 16750862 22028672 12949276 19382230 9738746 21483405 21795282 21081729 18797280 20634204 19680443 16595175 20147036 19732865 17668381 20702402 16847180 20409595 17403841 19580641 19728873 20926424 15499007 19933162 3068089 6778349 11994236 20220756 21943191 17903299 22328782
23974872	Genome-wide association analysis identifies 13 new risk loci for schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is an idiopathic mental disorder with a heritable component and a substantial public health impact. We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) for schizophrenia beginning with a Swedish national sample (5,001 cases and 6,243 controls) followed by meta-analysis with previous schizophrenia GWAS (8,832 cases and 12,067 controls) and finally by replication of SNPs in 168 genomic regions in independent samples (7,413 cases, 19,762 controls and 581 parent-offspring trios). We identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously implicated in bipolar disorder. Examination of candidate genes at these loci suggests the involvement of neuronal calcium signaling. We estimate that 8,300 independent, mostly common SNPs (95% credible interval of 6,300-10,200 SNPs) contribute to risk for schizophrenia and that these collectively account for at least 32% of the variance in liability. Common genetic variation has an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and larger studies will allow more detailed understanding of this disorder. 	 19571809 18752109 22532805 21129364 20502693 11315092 19474294 20369019 22941192 16096514 16863597 22384356 12395142 15279046 14638593 21890647 22344220 22863191 15652477 22003227 18344981 16251435 22955617 16617271 20506192 19349958 22883433 22138821 22783273 20595425 19150704 23042115 22446960 18174367 17357067 18711365 20881960 18197188 22955616 21926972 20118450 20935630 21122937 21926974 22614287 8657240 21743468 17909124 20368621 18852200 22726847 17034879 19571808 16339049 10707982 22472876 22433715 17493296 21353194 22307276 21307931 14990230 19996148 17701901 15979127 21931320 21407268 19223927 18348202 23062665 22513993 21167468 15454078 20601676 20442332 20453842 9974454 15020472 22955828 19571811 20562874 15916472 11248156 21505112 22688191 22885689 14662550 16135560 20668236 22777127

23979607	Genome-wide analyses of borderline personality features.	The heritability of borderline personality (BP) features has been established in multiple twin and family studies. Using data from the borderline subscale of the Personality Assessment Inventory Borderline Features Scale (PAI-BOR) collected in two Dutch cohorts (N=7125), the Netherlands Twin Register and The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, we show that heritability of the PAI-BOR total score using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) is estimated at 23%, and that the genetic variance is substantially higher in affect instability items compared with the other three subscales of the PAI-BOR (42.7% vs non-significant estimates for self-harm, negative relations and identity problems). We present results from a first genome-wide association study of BP features, which shows a promising signal on chromosome 5 corresponding to SERINC5, a protein involved in myelination. Reduced myelination has been suggested as possibly having a role in the development of psychiatric disorders characterized by lack of social interaction. The signal was confirmed in a third independent Dutch cohort drawn from the Erasmus Rucphen Family study (N=1301). Our analyses were complemented by investigating the heterogeneity that was implied by the differences in genetic variance components in the four subscales of the PAI-BOR. These analyses show that the association of SNPs tagging SERINC5 differs substantially across the 24 items of the PAI-BOR. Further, using reverse regression we showed that the effects were present only in subjects with higher scores on the PAI-BOR. Taken together, these results suggest that future genome-wide analyses can benefit substantially by taking into account the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of BP features. 	 11575622 11520894 11778395 11823272 12062877 12062878 15008803 14997420 3737788 3233245 9326262 15845033 17254420 17266418 17701901 17988414 18763692 18275631 19825271 18427559 19400977 19748081 19918758 20562875 20379614 21812103 21640387 23143512 22983301 22686225 22999891 23359524 23089630 20695804 11748321

23996088	Variation at 10p12.2 and 10p14 influences risk of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and phenotype.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer diagnosed in economically developed countries with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, accounting for approximately 70% of ALL. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided the first unambiguous evidence for common inherited susceptibility to BCP-ALL, identifying susceptibility loci at 7p12.2, 9p21.3, 10q21.2, and 14q11.2. To identify additional BCP-ALL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1658 cases and 4723 controls, with validation in 1449 cases and 1488 controls. Combined analysis identified novel loci mapping to 10p12.2 (rs10828317, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; P = 2.30 × 10(-9)) and 10p14 marked by rs3824662 (OR = 1.31; P = 8.62 × 10(-12)). The single nucleotide polymorphism rs10828317 is responsible for the N215S polymorphism in exon 7 of PIP4K2A, and rs3824662 localizes to intron 3 of the transcription factor and putative tumor suppressor gene GATA3. The rs10828317 association was shown to be specifically associated with hyperdiploid ALL, whereas the rs3824662-associated risk was confined to nonhyperdiploid non-TEL-AML1 + ALL. The risk allele of rs3824662 was correlated with older age at diagnosis (P < .001) and significantly worse event-free survivorship (P < .0001). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to BCP-ALL and the influence of constitutional genotype on disease development. 	
24009623	Genome-wide association study for biomarker identification of Rapamycin and Everolimus using a lymphoblastoid cell line system.	The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, a set of promising potential anti-cancer agents, has shown response variability among individuals. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers and mechanisms that might influence the response to Rapamycin and Everolimus. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mRNA, and microRNAs microarray data were assessed for association with area under the cytotoxicity dose response curve (AUC) of two mTOR inhibitors in 272 human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Integrated analysis among SNPs, expression data, microRNA data and AUC values were also performed to help select candidate genes for further functional characterization. Functional validation of candidate genes using siRNA screening in multiple cell lines followed by MTS assays for the two mTOR inhibitors were performed. We found that 16 expression probe sets (genes) that overlapped between the two drugs were associated with AUC values of two mTOR inhibitors. One hundred and twenty seven and one hundred SNPs had P < 10(-4), while 8 and 10 SNPs had P < 10(-5) with Rapamycin and Everolimus AUC, respectively. Functional studies indicated that 13 genes significantly altered cell sensitivity to either one or both drugs in at least one cell line. Additionally, one microRNA, miR-10a, was significantly associated with AUC values for both drugs and was shown to repress expression of genes that were associated with AUC and desensitize cells to both drugs. In summary, this study identified genes and a microRNA that might contribute to response to mTOR inhibitors. 	 18308931 19732725 18556508 12563289 16039986 19074828 16862161 15166021 16815317 15627018 18612163 20081105 19712457 16404421 21383697 16249748 18337557 16549775 15059040 11916499 19224581 15728109 15882623 18757419 20876420 15690031 15707415 19461655 18215105 18787170 17728765 14744438 15624019 21428770 17660710 19644074 17941052 17192769 17363563 19898621 11029573 16002336 19167326 20566686 19043577 15361871 20012925 20923822 17045090 15735698

24023788	Gene network analysis in a pediatric cohort identifies novel lung function genes.	Lung function is a heritable trait and serves as an important clinical predictor of morbidity and mortality for pulmonary conditions in adults, however, despite its importance, no studies have focused on uncovering pediatric-specific loci influencing lung function. To identify novel genetic determinants of pediatric lung function, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of four pulmonary function traits, including FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75% in 1556 children. Further, we carried out gene network analyses for each trait including all SNPs with a P-value of <1.0 × 10(-3) from the individual GWAS. The GWAS identified SNPs with notable trends towards association with the pulmonary function measures, including the previously described INTS12 locus association with FEV1 (pmeta=1.41 × 10(-7)). The gene network analyses identified 34 networks of genes associated with pulmonary function variables in Caucasians. Of those, the glycoprotein gene network reached genome-wide significance for all four variables. P-value range pmeta=6.29 × 10(-4) - 2.80 × 10(-8) on meta-analysis. In this study, we report on specific pathways that are significantly associated with pediatric lung function at genome-wide significance. In addition, we report the first loci associated with lung function in both pediatric Caucasian and African American populations.	 10861898 21946350 12604612 15280177 398264 3800147 9603122 16438732 16916379 17572673 17701901 18269586 19131956 19115389 19187332 19098027 19249008 19300500 19307885 19543373 19235186 20010834 20010835 20045868 20522846 20395557 20647190 21903630 22510280 23269371 20616382 21080917 21495838 21660583 11719305
23999434	Common genetic variation at the IL1RL1 locus regulates IL-33/ST2 signaling.	The suppression of tumorigenicity 2/IL-33 (ST2/IL-33) pathway has been implicated in several immune and inflammatory diseases. ST2 is produced as 2 isoforms. The membrane-bound isoform (ST2L) induces an immune response when bound to its ligand, IL-33. The other isoform is a soluble protein (sST2) that is thought to be a decoy receptor for IL-33 signaling. Elevated sST2 levels in serum are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. We investigated the determinants of sST2 plasma concentrations in 2,991 Framingham Offspring Cohort participants. While clinical and environmental factors explained some variation in sST2 levels, much of the variation in sST2 production was driven by genetic factors. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), multiple SNPs within IL1RL1 (the gene encoding ST2) demonstrated associations with sST2 concentrations. Five missense variants of IL1RL1 correlated with higher sST2 levels in the GWAS and mapped to the intracellular domain of ST2, which is absent in sST2. In a cell culture model, IL1RL1 missense variants increased sST2 expression by inducing IL-33 expression and enhancing IL-33 responsiveness (via ST2L). Our data suggest that genetic variation in IL1RL1 can result in increased levels of sST2 and alter immune and inflammatory signaling through the ST2/IL-33 pathway. 	 21871564 18613828 21551163 19808354 20385815 12740434 20363761 22585662 23065477 18375488 21782286 21871091 19715440 19289601 18311140 21178018 20406635 12578875 18378613 19219041 18667700 19017513 19073967 18566370 21211603 15117853 21378990 474565 22907935 20860503 10671496 21897866 19699192 16286016 18802081 9545414 12460879 17492053 18995177 10491084 20937871 21629437 17692745 20040588 19198610 12824332 19661270 16030072 19919994 20200353
24001895	Genome-wide association study meta-analysis reveals transethnic replication of mean arterial and pulse pressure loci.	We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure among 26,600 East Asian participants (stage 1) followed by replication study of up to 28,783 participants (stage 2). For novel loci, statistical significance was determined by a P<5.0×10(-8) in joint analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 data. For loci reported by the previous mean arterial and pulse pressure genome-wide association study meta-analysis in Europeans, evidence of transethnic replication was determined by consistency in effect direction and a Bonferroni-corrected P<1.4×10(-3). No novel loci were identified by the current study. Five independent mean arterial pressure variants demonstrated robust evidence for transethnic replication including rs17249754 at ATP2B1 (P=7.5×10(-15)), rs2681492 at ATP2B1 (P=3.4×10(-7)), rs11191593 at NT5C2 (1.1×10(-6)), rs3824755 at CYP17A1 (P=1.2×10(-6)), and rs13149993 at FGF5 (P=2.4×10(-4)). Two additional variants showed suggestive evidence of transethnic replication (consistency in effect direction and P<0.05), including rs319690 at MAP4 (P=0.014) and rs1173771 at NPR3 (P=0.018). For pulse pressure, robust evidence of replication was identified for 2 independent variants, including rs17249754 at ATP2B1 (P=1.2×10(-5)) and rs11191593 at NT5C2 (P=1.1×10(-3)), with suggestive evidence of replication among an additional 2 variants including rs3824755 at CYP17A1 (P=6.1×10(-3)) and rs2681492 at ATP2B1 (P=9.0×10(-3)). Replicated variants demonstrated consistency in effect sizes between East Asian and European samples, with effect size differences ranging from 0.03 to 0.24 mm Hg for mean arterial pressure and from 0.03 to 0.21 mm Hg for pulse pressure. In conclusion, we present the first evidence of transethnic replication of several mean arterial and pulse pressure loci in an East Asian population.	 21909115 10421594 15652604 19470869 18227866 21295844 23245609 15831820 8015573 12011645 17572673 21572416 19430479 15528234 21909110 20616382 19200528 20308177 19262225 17485599 20479155 21058334 16934002 15452026 19430483 21464461 22071413 22311909
24002674	Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of intraocular pressure.	Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma and is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported associations with IOP at TMCO1 and GAS7, and with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at CDKN2B-AS1, CAV1/CAV2, and SIX1/SIX6. To identify novel genetic variants and replicate the published findings, we performed GWAS and meta-analysis of IOP in >6,000 subjects of European ancestry collected in three datasets: the NEI Glaucoma Human genetics collaBORation, GLAUcoma Genes and ENvironment study, and a subset of the Age-related Macular Degeneration-Michigan, Mayo, AREDS and Pennsylvania study. While no signal achieved genome-wide significance in individual datasets, a meta-analysis identified significant associations with IOP at TMCO1 (rs7518099-G, p = 8.0 × 10(-8)). Focused analyses of five loci previously reported for IOP and/or POAG, i.e., TMCO1, CDKN2B-AS1, GAS7, CAV1/CAV2, and SIX1/SIX6, revealed associations with IOP that were largely consistent across our three datasets, and replicated the previously reported associations in both effect size and direction. These results confirm the involvement of common variants in multiple genomic regions in regulating IOP and/or glaucoma risk.	 20237253 11315092 14691154 14597032 19151388 16936733 19449125 17640733 21532571 8955565 16488940 18653607 17943122 12698048 22244945 16862071 9005853 7493232 22714896 21676464 23914252 15923494 15939473 17652737 20091798 20616382 16606871 22570627 22562842 19458324 18039350 12049574 23383229 9258228 21402981 17543874 11024415 21600658 22955989 20835238 17701901 22562845 15106943 22828004 22570617 20385819 20018682 17628686 22618757 15921747
24023777	Identification of a susceptibility locus for severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on chromosome 17q24.3.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformity, affecting around 2% of adolescents worldwide. Genetic factors play an important role in its etiology. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we recently identified novel AIS susceptibility loci on chromosomes 10q24.31 and 6q24.1. To identify more AIS susceptibility loci relating to its severity and progression, we performed GWAS by limiting the case subjects to those with severe AIS. Through a two-stage association study using a total of ∼12,000 Japanese subjects, we identified a common variant, rs12946942 that showed a significant association with severe AIS in the recessive model (P=4.00 × 10(-8), odds ratio [OR]=2.05). Its association was replicated in a Chinese population (combined P=6.43 × 10(-12), OR = 2.21). rs12946942 is on chromosome 17q24.3 near the genes SOX9 and KCNJ2, which when mutated cause scoliosis phenotypes. Our findings will offer new insight into the etiology and progression of AIS.	 11501945 18794762 18456103 22019779 22421045 17426641 16648749 12384783 17932119 15897833 12426569 11371347 10635522 19337134 19473998 18985072 19139660 18398418 17632395 18848651 12642767 10984791 9306532 23666238 16555077 17603485 17436250 19340878 21460842 12094330 22665440 17554300 16845357 19424484 9724758 10954107 6480635 22982078 17108398 20306271 3206283
24014518	Epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis and febrile seizures linked by common genetic variation around SCN1A.	Epilepsy comprises several syndromes, amongst the most common being mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. Seizures in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis are typically drug-resistant, and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is frequently associated with important co-morbidities, mandating the search for better understanding and treatment. The cause of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is unknown, but there is an association with childhood febrile seizures. Several rarer epilepsies featuring febrile seizures are caused by mutations in SCN1A, which encodes a brain-expressed sodium channel subunit targeted by many anti-epileptic drugs. We undertook a genome-wide association study in 1018 people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 7552 control subjects, with validation in an independent sample set comprising 959 people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 3591 control subjects. To dissect out variants related to a history of febrile seizures, we tested cases with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis with (overall n = 757) and without (overall n = 803) a history of febrile seizures. Meta-analysis revealed a genome-wide significant association for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis with febrile seizures at the sodium channel gene cluster on chromosome 2q24.3 [rs7587026, within an intron of the SCN1A gene, P = 3.36 × 10(-9), odds ratio (A) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.59]. In a cohort of 172 individuals with febrile seizures, who did not develop epilepsy during prospective follow-up to age 13 years, and 6456 controls, no association was found for rs7587026 and febrile seizures. These findings suggest SCN1A involvement in a common epilepsy syndrome, give new direction to biological understanding of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis with febrile seizures, and open avenues for investigation of prognostic factors and possible prevention of epilepsy in some children with febrile seizures. 	 22905747 20981092 20509871 22797810 16326807 17436242 17537961 17544618 15021243 15144438 18294201 18554360 20506560 18655196 11756608 12499305 18691889 20522523 20351042 20196795 19945931 19949041 19373277 19289736 19125847 20499252 20976764 22820512 22497612 22459683 22315182 22000136 21719429 21263461 21058334
24023261	THOC5: a novel gene involved in HDL-cholesterol metabolism.	Although numerous genes are known to regulate serum lipid traits, identified variants explain only a small proportion of the expected heritability. We intended to identify further genetic variants associated with lipid phenotypes in a self-contained population of Sorbs in Germany. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels in 839 Sorbs. All single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a P value <0.01 were subjected to a meta-analysis, including an independent Swedish cohort (Diabetes Genetics Initiative; n = ∼3,100). Novel association signals with the strongest effects were subjected to replication studies in an additional German cohort (Berlin, n = 2,031). In the initial GWAS in the Sorbs, we identified 14 loci associated with lipid phenotypes reaching P values <10⁻⁵ and confirmed significant effects for 18 previously reported loci. The combined meta-analysis of the three study cohorts (n(HDL) = 6041; n(LDL) = 5,995; n(TG) = 6,087) revealed a novel association for a variant in THOC5 (rs8135828) with serum HDL-C levels (P = 1.78 × 10⁻⁷; Z-score = -5.221). Consistently, the variant was also associated with circulating APOA1 levels in Sorbs. The small interfering RNA-mediated mRNA silencing of THOC5 in HepG2 cells resulted in lower mRNA levels of APOA1, SCARB1, and ABCG8 (all P < 0.05). We propose THOC5 to be a novel gene involved in the regulation of serum HDL-C levels.	 23063622 20686565 18193044 18262040 18771588 19060906 19060911 20616382 23031429 23505323 15133499 15164069 9507992 15297300 16151025 16909111 17430997 17463246 17701901 17786152 21525145 21829380 21559053 22431312 22336959 22923419 19812666 19729412 19584900 20051105 20009918 20616715 20657596 18193043
24023260	Genetic association with lipids in Filipinos: waist circumference modifies an APOA5 effect on triglyceride levels.	Blood levels of lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) are highly heritable and are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Approximately 100 lipid-associated loci have been identified in populations of European ancestry. We performed a genome-wide association study of lipid traits in 1,782 Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, and tested for evidence of interactions with waist circumference. We conducted additional association and interaction analyses in 1,719 of their young adult offspring. Genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) were detected at APOE for low density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol, and at APOA5 for TGs. Suggestive associations (P < 10⁻⁶) were detected at GCKR for TGs, and at CETP and TOM1 for high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Our data also supported the existence of allelic heterogeneity at APOA5, CETP, LIPC, and APOE. The secondary signal (Gly185Cys) at APOA5 exhibited a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-by-waist circumference interaction affecting TGs (Pinteraction = 1.6 × 10⁻⁴), manifested by stronger SNP effects as waist circumference increased. These findings provide the first evidence that central obesity may accentuate the effect of the TG-increasing allele of the APOA5 signal, emphasizing that CVD risk could be reduced by central obesity control.	 10781644 24097068 12164474 12953181 12915450 15340117 4054601 7749885 9640420 16741276 16862161 17885426 17766366 18193043 18193044 18307700 18635818 19060906 19060911 19005228 19596186 19738633 20199988 20154341 20686565 20570916 21252145 20507864 21829380 21909109 22028671 22008704 22010046 22171074 22451038 22876189 22688886 22684633 23555291 11335780
24025145	A genome-wide association study of chemotherapy-induced alopecia in breast cancer patients.	Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is one of the most common adverse events caused by conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, yet there has been very little progress in the prevention or treatment of this side effect. Although this is not a life-threatening event, alopecia is very psychologically difficult for many women to manage. In order to improve the quality of life for these women, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced alopecia and develop ways to effectively prevent and/or treat it. To identify the genetic risk factors associated with chemotherapy-induced alopecia, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using DNA samples from breast cancer patients who were treated with chemotherapy.	 23369683 11501945 20060649 19052558 21607133 17982410 19879194 16278051 9376266 12446783 11879330 20596022 18083096 19373490 9069615 22178150 15642703 7826913 16972183 14592971 18480165 10899310 22696062 11829374 8682968 11371349 18287387 19228622 17701901 10498493 11152763 1641535 19370586 7525048 2055226 19341937
24068947	Common variants in left/right asymmetry genes and pathways are associated with relative hand skill.	Humans display structural and functional asymmetries in brain organization, strikingly with respect to language and handedness. The molecular basis of these asymmetries is unknown. We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis for a quantitative measure of relative hand skill in individuals with dyslexia [reading disability (RD)] (n = 728). The most strongly associated variant, rs7182874 (P = 8.68 × 10(-9)), is located in PCSK6, further supporting an association we previously reported. We also confirmed the specificity of this association in individuals with RD; the same locus was not associated with relative hand skill in a general population cohort (n = 2,666). As PCSK6 is known to regulate NODAL in the development of left/right (LR) asymmetry in mice, we developed a novel approach to GWAS pathway analysis, using gene-set enrichment to test for an over-representation of highly associated variants within the orthologs of genes whose disruption in mice yields LR asymmetry phenotypes. Four out of 15 LR asymmetry phenotypes showed an over-representation (FDR ≤ 5%). We replicated three of these phenotypes; situs inversus, heterotaxia, and double outlet right ventricle, in the general population cohort (FDR ≤ 5%). Our findings lead us to propose that handedness is a polygenic trait controlled in part by the molecular mechanisms that establish LR body asymmetry early in development.	 22507743 19934467 16198126 17075880 20585627 21085122 16254602 20834053 17918566 15894532 20714348 21060895 9345512 22479201 19671664 4037763 19557186 19897211 22579704 10809672 16291790 11867730 19098895 22558177 22138821 10331971 14594743 17667961 11282814 14837905 19733558 16128050 22983710 21698230 20509871 9246435 19824766 20517342 14684825 15877707 16790509 15615683 9974150 16722803 4023705 8928008 23631511 11389842 15886103 24234275 16500025 11237119 20452748 10522882 9915503 18824185 10557084 15382729 1854469 24233472 22711189 12831115 16886185 15514892 23826248 11687504 2354611 14621511 11099452 9391144 21051773 11144351 19076401 9885250 19758680 16273319 23650548 19543373 11525833 18981050 22396656 21500084
24026423	A genome- and phenome-wide association study to identify genetic variants influencing platelet count and volume and their pleiotropic effects.	Platelets are enucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes that play key roles in hemostasis and in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis and cancer. Platelet traits are highly heritable and identification of genetic variants associated with platelet traits and assessing their pleiotropic effects may help to understand the role of underlying biological pathways. We conducted an electronic medical record (EMR)-based study to identify common variants that influence inter-individual variation in the number of circulating platelets (PLT) and mean platelet volume (MPV), by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We characterized genetic variants associated with MPV and PLT using functional, pathway and disease enrichment analyses; we assessed pleiotropic effects of such variants by performing a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with a wide range of EMR-derived phenotypes. A total of 13,582 participants in the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomic network had data for PLT and 6,291 participants had data for MPV. We identified five chromosomal regions associated with PLT and eight associated with MPV at genome-wide significance (P < 5E-8). In addition, we replicated 20 SNPs [out of 56 SNPs (α: 0.05/56 = 9E-4)] influencing PLT and 22 SNPs [out of 29 SNPs (α: 0.05/29 = 2E-3)] influencing MPV in a published meta-analysis of GWAS of PLT and MPV. While our GWAS did not find any new associations, our functional analyses revealed that genes in these regions influence thrombopoiesis and encode kinases, membrane proteins, proteins involved in cellular trafficking, transcription factors, proteasome complex subunits, proteins of signal transduction pathways, proteins involved in megakaryocyte development, and platelet production and hemostasis. PheWAS using a single-SNP Bonferroni correction for 1,368 diagnoses (0.05/1368 = 3.6E-5) revealed that several variants in these genes have pleiotropic associations with myocardial infarction, autoimmune, and hematologic disorders. We conclude that multiple genetic loci influence interindividual variation in platelet traits and also have significant pleiotropic effects; the related genes are in multiple functional pathways including those relevant to thrombopoiesis.	 21909115 14720470 18981052 22216278 10984428 20335276 19528534 20610812 19110211 22955986 19853236 10070825 19740098 16322783 19450911 14622657 9744824 23463857 4957257 11172032 7503742 23392276 22094253 18311140 15354265 18799560 21234875 17712044 22493691 19430479 20971364 20508602 15870178 20927387 15315966 8338765 21981779 21743469 20647273 10601342 18403245 17554260 21269473 19820697 1423821 19221038 11425767 16322779 696842 19332590 21193429 12738684 21079248 22094248 21058334 21781261 21738486 23263488 21071698 19478018 15115669 19430483 20634204 20562859 20139978 21258396 21594894 17701901 6411169 15802619 22139419 20482312 21962507 10494030 19198610 12952881 19228925 16268476 22423221 16118320 23468663 15252124 15705783 19691483 20208533
24029427	Chromosome 2q31.1 associates with ESRD in women with type 1 diabetes.	Sex and genetic variation influence the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy and ESRD in patients with type 1 diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association study in a cohort of 3652 patients from the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study with type 1 diabetes to determine whether sex-specific genetic risk factors for ESRD exist. A common variant, rs4972593 on chromosome 2q31.1, was associated with ESRD in women (P<5×10(-8)) but not in men (P=0.77). This association was replicated in the meta-analysis of three independent type 1 diabetes cohorts (P=0.02) and remained significant for women (P<5×10(-8); odds ratio, 1.81 [95% confidence interval, 1.47 to 2.24]) upon combined meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts. rs4972593 is located between the genes that code for the Sp3 transcription factor, which interacts directly with estrogen receptor α and regulates the expression of genes linked to glomerular function and the pathogenesis of nephropathy, and the CDCA7 transcription factor, which regulates cell proliferation. Further examination revealed potential transcription factor-binding sites within rs4972593 and predicted eight estrogen-responsive elements within 5 kb of this locus. Moreover, we found sex-specific differences in the glomerular expression levels of SP3 (P=0.004). Overall, these results suggest that rs4972593 is a sex-specific genetic variant associated with ESRD in patients with type 1 diabetes and may underlie the sex-specific protection against ESRD. 	 22532805 18395675 16862161 11733557 21509443 18458324 15994934 10816575 14647449 12499305 18395681 11733379 8269796 21067504 15642484 15331558 20442780 20616382 22266139 18076206 22139845 23028342 16043748 22955989 17065335 17701901 21752957
24039173	Genetic predictors of risk and resilience in psychiatric disorders: a cross-disorder genome-wide association study of functional impairment in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.	Functional impairment is one of the most enduring, intractable consequences of psychiatric disorders and is both familial and heritable. Previous studies have suggested that variation in functional impairment can be independent of symptom severity. Here we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of functional impairment in the context of major mental illness. Participants of European-American descent (N = 2,246) were included from three large treatment studies of bipolar disorder (STEP-BD) (N = 765), major depressive disorder (STAR*D) (N = 1091), and schizophrenia (CATIE) (N = 390). At study entry, participants completed the SF-12, a widely used measure of health-related quality of life. We performed a GWAS and pathway analysis of the mental and physical components of health-related quality of life across diagnosis (∼1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms), adjusting for psychiatric symptom severity. Psychiatric symptom severity was a significant predictor of functional impairment, but it accounted for less than one-third of the variance across disorders. After controlling for diagnostic category and symptom severity, the strongest evidence of genetic association was between variants in ADAMTS16 and physical functioning (P = 5.87 × 10(-8) ). Pathway analysis did not indicate significant enrichment after correction for gene clustering and multiple testing. This study illustrates a phenotypic framework for examining genetic contributions to functional impairment across psychiatric disorders.	 20702402 23561268 20981491 20038947 21312395 21349586 21771567 21958091 21909115 22017222 21995725 22001495 22329468 22263841 20624752 22532805 11078054 11867212 12778843 12788248 12908658 15061154 6080235 1593914 8450681 8277801 7702446 8610818 8628042 9161111 9596066 10424639 14399272 15541061 15618952 15554875 16172203 16224309 16566612 16635643 17701901 17204532 17982457 18348202 18317468 18347602 19139138 19456223 19487624 19423552 19571811 19635554 19846067 20196982 20485568 20595427 20714348 22548895 22406280 21562142 20713499
24058526	Genome-wide meta-analysis of systolic blood pressure in children with sickle cell disease.	In pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, it has been reported that higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) is associated with increased risk of a silent cerebral infarction (SCI). SCI is a major cause of neurologic morbidity in children with SCD, and blood pressure is a potential modulator of clinical manifestations of SCD; however, the risk factors underlying these complications are not well characterized. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that influence SBP in an African American population in the setting of SCD, and explore the use of SBP as an endo-phenotype for SCI. We conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis for SBP using two SCD cohorts, as well as a candidate screen based on published SBP loci. A total of 1,617 patients were analyzed, and while no SNP reached genome-wide significance (P-value<5.0 x 10(-8)), a number of suggestive candidate loci were identified. The most significant SNP, rs7952106 (P-value=8.57 x 10(-7)), was in the DRD2 locus on chromosome 11. In a gene-based association analysis, MIR4301 (micro-RNA4301), which resides in an intron of DRD2, was the most significant gene (P-value=5.2 x 10(-5)). Examining 27 of the previously reported SBP associated SNPs, 4 SNPs were nominally significant. A genetic risk score was constructed to assess the aggregated genetic effect of the published SBP variants, demonstrating a significant association (P=0.05). In addition, we also assessed whether these variants are associated with SCI, validating the use of SBP as an endo-phenotype for SCI. Three SNPs were nominally associated, and only rs2357790 (5' CACNB2) was significant for both SBP and SCI. None of these SNPs retained significance after Bonferroni correction. Taken together, our results suggest the importance of DRD2 genetic variation in the modulation of SBP, and extend the aggregated importance of previously reported SNPs in the modulation of SBP in an African American cohort, more specifically in children with SCD.	 21909115 946622 11315092 16862161 2643968 19902523 2784957 22096242 7235808 8447334 12554675 16255080 19369657 17761929 19812673 20153824 12563019 474567 7092436 17190875 19430479 3341219 7114401 20401335 21829371 20616382 17225249 576938 20811451 14610323 6118599 10099145 18806613 20233392 15900211 4258936 21058334 21068435 19430483 17701901 21076409 20981092 8494475 16990141 22354000 19500105 21732836 9236450 20201689 8733975 9585446
24043878	Common variants on Xq28 conferring risk of schizophrenia in Han Chinese.	Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, severe psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world population. A substantial portion of heritability is still unexplained and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains to be elucidated. To identify more schizophrenia susceptibility loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 498 patients with schizophrenia and 2025 controls from the Han Chinese population, and a follow-up study on 1027 cases and 1005 controls. In the follow-up study, we included 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were selected from the top hits in our GWAS (130 SNPs) and from previously implicated loci for schizophrenia based on the SZGene database, NHGRI GWAS Catalog, copy number variation studies, GWAS meta-analysis results from the international Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and candidate genes from plausible biological pathways (254 SNPs). Within the chromosomal region Xq28, SNP rs2269372 in RENBP achieved genome-wide significance with a combined P value of 3.98 × 10(-8) (OR of allele A = 1.31). SNPs with suggestive P values were identified within 2 genes that have been previously implicated in schizophrenia, MECP2 (rs2734647, P combined = 8.78 × 10(-7), OR = 1.28; rs2239464, P combined = 6.71 × 10(-6), OR = 1.26) and ARHGAP4 (rs2269368, P combined = 4.74 × 10(-7), OR = 1.25). In addition, the patient sample in our follow-up study showed a significantly greater burden for pre-defined risk alleles based on the SNPs selected than the controls. This indicates the existence of schizophrenia susceptibility loci among the SNPs we selected. This also further supports multigenic inheritance in schizophrenia. Our findings identified a new schizophrenia susceptibility locus on Xq28, which harbor the genes RENBP, MECP2, and ARHGAP4.	 21068835 16862161 18583979 22641179 22171069 22584866 22037552 15864560 15581395 15211631 19717458 19939292 18511691 11532982 19150704 22384028 20800221 19920835 15142685 21926972 21926974 21843369 10508514 22037555 11720692 21277876 20368621 12135541 22174901 18986708 16865103 20010451 18332876 11772708 20072116 19556021 23418459 17701901 19025758 8726689 7658823 9048778 22998933 21397060 19571811 11930274 17804252 19543373 14662550 18441336
24045676	Genome-wide association studies and epistasis analyses of candidate genes related to age at menarche and age at natural menopause in a Korean population.	The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms and gene-gene interactions that are significantly associated with age at menarche and age at menopause in a Korean population.	
24046328	A variant in LDLR is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cardiovascular disease among older people and demonstrates significant heritability. In contrast to similar complex diseases, relatively few genetic associations with AAA have been confirmed. We reanalyzed our genome-wide study and carried through to replication suggestive discovery associations at a lower level of significance.	
24049095	Genome-wide association study of sex hormones, gonadotropins and sex hormone-binding protein in Chinese men.	Sex hormones and gonadotropins exert a wide variety of effects in physiological and pathological processes. Accumulated evidence shows a strong heritable component of circulating concentrations of these hormones. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted in Caucasians have identified multiple loci that influence serum levels of sex hormones. However, the genetic determinants remain unknown in Chinese populations. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with major sex hormones, gonadotropins, including testosterone, oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in a Chinese population.	
24057671	Genome-wide association study of ancestry-specific TB risk in the South African Coloured population.	The worldwide burden of tuberculosis (TB) remains an enormous problem, and is particularly severe in the admixed South African Coloured (SAC) population residing in the Western Cape. Despite evidence from twin studies suggesting a strong genetic component to TB resistance, only a few loci have been identified to date. In this work, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS), meta-analysis and trans-ethnic fine mapping to attempt the replication of previously identified TB susceptibility loci. Our GWAS results confirm the WT1 chr11 susceptibility locus (rs2057178: odds ratio = 0.62, P = 2.71e(-06)) previously identified by Thye et al., but fail to replicate previously identified polymorphisms in the TLR8 gene and locus 18q11.2. Our study demonstrates that the genetic contribution to TB risk varies between continental populations, and illustrates the value of including admixed populations in studies of TB risk and other complex phenotypes. Our evaluation of local ancestry based on the real and simulated data demonstrates that case-only admixture mapping is currently impractical in multi-way admixed populations, such as the SAC, due to spurious deviations in average local ancestry generated by current local ancestry inference methods. This study provides insights into identifying disease genes and ancestry-specific disease risk in multi-way admixed populations. 	 11315092 23717212 565607 3347221 8393820 8903265 9863786 10517722 15636493 15812488 16449260 16513383 16862161 17160276 17194218 17701901 18927625 18940314 19147409 19407144 19477991 19543370 19526211 19648217 19892779 19780822 20208533 20346436 20206579 20490549 20647190 20694014 20811451 20799037 21283783 21565292 21709689 22018224 22291602 22306650 22499340 22495753 22997136 23128226 23136122 23421795 23555291 23456169 23572411 12499305

24047826	Genome-wide association study identifies 3 genomic loci significantly associated with serum levels of homoarginine: the AtheroRemo Consortium.	Low serum levels of the amino acid derivative, homoarginine, have been associated with increased risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. Homoarginine deficiency may be related to renal and heart diseases, but the pathophysiologic role of homoarginine and the genetic regulation of its serum levels are largely unknown.	
24068962	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies six new Loci for serum calcium concentrations.	Calcium is vital to the normal functioning of multiple organ systems and its serum concentration is tightly regulated. Apart from CASR, the genes associated with serum calcium are largely unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 39,400 individuals from 17 population-based cohorts and investigated the 14 most strongly associated loci in ≤ 21,679 additional individuals. Seven loci (six new regions) in association with serum calcium were identified and replicated. Rs1570669 near CYP24A1 (P = 9.1E-12), rs10491003 upstream of GATA3 (P = 4.8E-09) and rs7481584 in CARS (P = 1.2E-10) implicate regions involved in Mendelian calcemic disorders: Rs1550532 in DGKD (P = 8.2E-11), also associated with bone density, and rs7336933 near DGKH/KIAA0564 (P = 9.1E-10) are near genes that encode distinct isoforms of diacylglycerol kinase. Rs780094 is in GCKR. We characterized the expression of these genes in gut, kidney, and bone, and demonstrate modulation of gene expression in bone in response to dietary calcium in mice. Our results shed new light on the genetics of calcium homeostasis.	 14966569 22799769 19587147 19805330 18501891 17180344 15542836 9891089 19643913 21081658 21996351 17921354 20705733 22082362 12193151 23042810 21542007 20969588 1618870 10935639 22500112 11032422 22634751 23022100 22444668 20616382 22955620 22992777 22100507 15040831 17699549 21800853 16319112 21766206 12810723 20558539 21812026 22094003 18678614 1522843 22504420 21559478 20541252 6541017 14595018 20089499 1317758 1322859 20661308 12200442 17129787
24047446	Genome-wide association study of co-occurring anxiety in major depression.	Co-morbidity between depression and anxiety disorders is common. In this study we define a quantitative measure of anxiety by summating four anxiety items from the SCAN interview in a large collection of major depression (MDD) cases to identify genes contributing to this complex phenotype.	
24086445	Genome-wide association analysis with gray matter volume as a quantitative phenotype in first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia.	Reduced Gray matter (GM) volume is a core feature of schizophrenia. Mapping genes that is associated with the heritable disease-related phenotypes may be conducive to elucidate the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This study aims to identify the common genetic variants that underlie the deficits of GM volume in schizophrenia. High-resolution T1 images and whole genome genotyping data were obtained from 74 first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia and 51 healthy controls in the Mental Health Centre of the West China Hospital, Sichuan University. All participants were scanned using a 3T MR imaging system and were genotyped using the HumanHap660 Bead Array. Reduced GM volumes in three brain areas including right hOC3v in the collateral sulcus of visual cortex (hOC3vR), left cerebellar vermis lobule 10 (vermisL10) and right cerebellar vermis lobule 10 (vermisR10) were found in patients with schizophrenia [corrected].There was a group by genotype interaction when genotypes from genome-wide scan were subsequently considered in the case-control analyses. SNPs from three genes or chromosomal regions (TBXAS1, PIK3C2G and HS3ST5) were identified to predict the changes of GM volume in hOC3vL, vermisL10 and vermisR10. These results also highlighted the usefulness of endophenotype in exploring the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia although further independent replication studies are needed in the future.	 12740361 21368748 17266106 16164764 16862161 14581932 19446645 22037552 19346322 22056751 18606306 19295510 19770054 17499520 20495793 12668349 19157788 18793730 11568431 20547448 19573260 19023125 19403042 22037555 19361957 19457380 17893707 20027592 20633666 3474774 20065955 17554300 22504417 16781166 15850749 21300943 18725863 21697947 17701901 21924872 15955494 12391568 19700006 10428662 23360727 11184633 20171287 22343889 19759093
24065183	Genome-wide association study of handedness excludes simple genetic models.	Handedness is a human behavioural phenotype that appears to be congenital, and is often assumed to be inherited, but for which the developmental origin and underlying causation(s) have been elusive. Models of the genetic basis of variation in handedness have been proposed that fit different features of the observed resemblance between relatives, but none has been decisively tested or a corresponding causative locus identified. In this study, we applied data from well-characterised individuals studied at the London Twin Research Unit. Analysis of genome-wide SNP data from 3940 twins failed to identify any locus associated with handedness at a genome-wide level of significance. The most straightforward interpretation of our analyses is that they exclude the simplest formulations of the 'right-shift' model of Annett and the 'dextral/chance' model of McManus, although more complex modifications of those models are still compatible with our observations. For polygenic effects, our study is inadequately powered to reliably detect alleles with effect sizes corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.2, but should have good power to detect effects at an odds ratio of 2 or more. 	 19343178 19492015 23766329 17846035 18300295 17667961 17572673 23088889 19428393 22856374 3863155 16611467 23631511 15513117 9705063 17554300 18824185 11774074 7191061 21051773 18799415 19543373 19288302 18455228
24124411	Genome-wide association study of liver enzymes in korean children.	Liver enzyme elevations, as an indicator of liver function, are widely associated with metabolic diseases. Genome-wide population-based association studies have identified a genetic susceptibility to liver enzyme elevations and their related traits; however, the genetic architecture in childhood remains largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify new genetic loci for liver enzyme levels in a Korean childhood cohort (n = 484). We observed three novel loci (rs4949718, rs80311637, and rs596406) that were multiply associated with elevated levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase. Although there are some limitations, including genetic power, additional replication and functional characterization will support the clarity on the genetic contribution that the ST6GALNAC3, ADAMTS9, and CELF2 genes have in childhood liver function. 	 21381068 1968373 11148181 23161442 22258181 23451816 16169874 21898508 18940312 10781624 22001757 18519826 15499043 9539189 9246041 21311593 22433174 12194918 18372903 22170794 20421487 21909109 18249212 18362506 21423719 12795448 14502318
24124408	Genome-wide association study of orthostatic hypotension and supine-standing blood pressure changes in two korean populations.	Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined by a 20-mm Hg difference of systolic blood pressure (dtSBP) and/or a 10-mm Hg difference of diastolic blood pressure (dtDBP) between supine and standing, and OH is associated with a failure of the cardiovascular reflex to maintain blood pressure on standing from a supine position. To understand the underlying genetic factors for OH traits (OH, dtSBP, and dtDBP), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using 333,651 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were conducted separately for two population-based cohorts, Ansung (n = 3,173) and Ansan (n = 3,255). We identified 8 SNPs (5 SNPs for dtSBP and 3 SNPs for dtDBP) that were repeatedly associated in both the Ansung and Ansan cohorts and had p-values of <1 × 10(-5) in the meta-analysis. Unfortunately, the SNPs of the OH case control GWAS did not pass our p-value criteria. Four of 8 SNPs were located in the intergenic region of chromosome 2, and the nearest gene (CTNNA2) was located at 1 Mb of distance. CTNNA2 is a linker between cadherin adhesion receptors and the actin cytoskeleton and is essential for stabilizing dendritic spines in rodent hippocampal neurons. Although there is no report about the function in blood pressure regulation, hippocampal neurons interact primarily with the autonomic nervous system and might be related to OH. The remaining SNPs, rs7098785 of dtSBP trait and rs6892553, rs16887217, and rs4959677 of dtDBP trait were located in the PIK3AP1 intron, ACTBL2-3' flanking, STAR intron, and intergenic region, respectively, but there was no clear functional link to blood pressure regulation. 	 15034585 1890281 19161151 1592445 3998049 11482743 19402222 11163197 15116144 8628505 12958120 10548884 20814408 16267090 16824795 17701901 9826316 8411037 19635985 19696189 19396169 10386511 7746371 16894039
24132900	Genome-wide association study of atypical psychosis.	Atypical psychosis with a periodic course of exacerbation and features of major psychiatric disorders [schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD)] has a long history in clinical psychiatry in Japan. Based upon the new criteria of atypical psychosis, a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) was conducted to identify the risk gene or variants. The relationships between atypical psychosis, SZ and BD were then assessed using independent GWAS data. Forty-seven patients with solid criteria of atypical psychosis and 882 normal controls (NCs) were scanned using an Affymetrics 6.0 chip. GWAS SZ data (560 SZ cases and 548 NCs) and GWAS BD (107 cases with BD type 1 and 107 NCs) were compared using gene-based analysis. The most significant SNPs were detected around the CHN2/CPVL genes (rs245914, P = 1.6 × 10(-7)) , COL21A1 gene (rs12196860, P = 2.45 × 10(-7) ), and PYGL/TRIM9 genes (rs1959536, P = 7.73 × 10(-7) ), although none of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms exhibited genome-wide significance (P = 5 × 10(-8) ). One of the highest peaks was detected on the major histocompatibility complex region, where large SZ GWASs have previously disclosed an association. The gene-based analysis suggested significant enrichment between SZ and atypical psychosis (P = 0.01), but not BD. This study provides clues about the types of patient whose diagnosis lies between SZ and BD. Studies with larger samples are required to determine the causal variant.	
24094242	Genome-wide association study on serum alkaline phosphatase levels in a Chinese population.	Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified several loci affecting ALP levels; however, such studies in Chinese populations are limited. We performed a GWAS analyzing the association between 658,288 autosomal SNPs and serum ALP in 1,461 subjects, and replicated the top SNPs in an additional 8,830 healthy Chinese Han individuals. The interactions between significant locus and environmental factors on serum ALP levels were further investigated.	 16358445 16862161 16916811 18940312 18667733 18974171 19302812 19278955 19520194 19841303 20103627 20139978 20233392 20147318 20511375 20231843 20832511 21239051 21330277 21378986 21306478 21680535 22001757 22011404 22387998 22531126 17572673 17701901 17873877 17973651 18414436 18547993 11085968 12046553 12114316 12500665 12866991 15375781 4550137 7449139 6724792 3621603 1458591 1458594 8427569 9111133 14251523 15405413 15542033 15297300
24097068	Discovery and refinement of loci associated with lipid levels.	Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are heritable, modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.	 4337382 21909115 1911720 11315092 12021839 21526222 21378988 16862161 22876189 18193043 20714348 23063622 21829380 18023224 18346983 1527066 18462017 20686565 19936222 20581827 18523221 9192891 18395529 22550134 20616382 20935630 20935629 21378990 22359512 13751193 18974833 17620530 8827514 20686566 22607825 22539988 20981092 20228789 1333807 21441907 10802651 20019324 20081858 3179802 20208533 21249183
24096698	Genome-wide association study of endometrial cancer in E2C2.	Endometrial cancer (EC), a neoplasm of the uterine epithelial lining, is the most common gynecological malignancy in developed countries and the fourth most common cancer among US women. Women with a family history of EC have an increased risk for the disease, suggesting that inherited genetic factors play a role. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of Type I EC. Stage 1 included 5,472 women (2,695 cases and 2,777 controls) of European ancestry from seven studies. We selected independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that displayed the most significant associations with EC in Stage 1 for replication among 17,948 women (4,382 cases and 13,566 controls) in a multiethnic population (African America, Asian, Latina, Hawaiian and European ancestry), from nine studies. Although no novel variants reached genome-wide significance, we replicated previously identified associations with genetic markers near the HNF1B locus. Our findings suggest that larger studies with specific tumor classification are necessary to identify novel genetic polymorphisms associated with EC susceptibility. 	 7351890 6457531 23535649 6860544 3358913 2538173 2114281 2491011 8484120 8484121 8221644 8253525 8275205 8128251 8072530 7979205 8674869 21514633 10649152 23636398 10891514 11169969 434029 8781735 17327436 17603485 17659325 18264096 18596976 18310059 18959813 19124504 19337055 19491263 19777250 20453838 20562874 21131975 21499250 22299039 22426144
24097066	A genome-wide association study in Han Chinese identifies a susceptibility locus for primary Sjögren's syndrome at 7q11.23.	Primary Sjögren's syndrome is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. So far, genetic studies of Sjögren's syndrome have relied mostly on candidate gene approaches. To identify new genetic susceptibility loci for primary Sjögren's syndrome, we performed a three-stage genome-wide association study in Han Chinese. In the discovery stage, we analyzed 556,134 autosomal SNPs in 542 cases and 1,050 controls. We then validated promising associations in 2 replication stages comprising 1,303 cases and 2,727 controls. The combined analysis identified GTF2I at 7q11.23 (rs117026326: Pcombined = 1.31 × 10(-53), combined odds ratio (ORcombined) = 2.20) as a new susceptibility locus for primary Sjögren's syndrome. Our analysis also confirmed previously reported associations in Europeans in the regions of STAT4, TNFAIP3 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Fine mapping of the region around GTF2I showed that rs117026326 in GTF2I had the most significant association, with associated SNPs extending from GTF2I to GTF2IRD1-GTF2I.	 21408207 18204098 22532805 16039337 19474294 17194218 19584730 16862161 21085122 23273568 23128226 20383147 18798840 21383967 20535138 12006334 17982456 16293761 22291604 21326317 8468491 20169177 17963047 19028369 18984408 18163481 19092842 19165919 19944401 22289719 22037610 15297300 20811451 22608712 7791159 19648290 21058334 19165918 19838193 20634204 17701901 22037551 21725308 20010835 22243964 23393912 20702402 18273036 20112363 12905478 19240061 21399635 20360187
24101674	A genome-wide association study in American Indians implicates DNER as a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes.	Most genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in Europeans. The current study reports a GWAS for young-onset T2DM in American Indians. Participants were selected from a longitudinal study conducted in Pima Indians and included 278 cases with diabetes with onset before 25 years of age, 295 nondiabetic controls ≥45 years of age, and 267 siblings of cases or controls. Individuals were genotyped on a ∼1M single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, resulting in 453,654 SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05. SNPs were analyzed for association in cases and controls, and a family-based association test was conducted. Tag SNPs (n = 311) were selected for 499 SNPs associated with diabetes (P < 0.0005 in case-control analyses or P < 0.0003 in family-based analyses), and these SNPs were genotyped in up to 6,834 additional Pima Indians to assess replication. Rs1861612 in DNER was associated with T2DM (odds ratio = 1.29 per copy of the T allele; P = 6.6 × 10(-8), which represents genome-wide significance accounting for the number of effectively independent SNPs analyzed). Transfection studies in murine pancreatic β-cells suggested that DNER regulates expression of notch signaling pathway genes. These studies implicate DNER as a susceptibility gene for T2DM in American Indians. 	 11118012 23630301 3899825 3766713 2192853 9203460 9433562 17001619 17557415 17846125 17909099 17627801 18200594 18300295 18372903 18711366 19008344 20390405 20581827 21701565 22158537 22474029 22885922 23300278 15514657
24216480	Lumbar disc degeneration is linked to a carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 variant.	Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is associated with both genetic and environmental factors and affects many people worldwide. A hallmark of LDD is loss of proteoglycan and water content in the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. While some genetic determinants have been reported, the etiology of LDD is largely unknown. Here we report the findings from linkage and association studies on a total of 32,642 subjects consisting of 4,043 LDD cases and 28,599 control subjects. We identified carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3), an enzyme that catalyzes proteoglycan sulfation, as a susceptibility gene for LDD. The strongest genome-wide linkage peak encompassed CHST3 from a Southern Chinese family–based data set, while a genome-wide association was observed at rs4148941 in the gene in a meta-analysis using multiethnic population cohorts. rs4148941 lies within a potential microRNA-513a-5p (miR-513a-5p) binding site. Interaction between miR-513a-5p and mRNA transcribed from the susceptibility allele (A allele) of rs4148941 was enhanced in vitro compared with transcripts from other alleles. Additionally, expression of CHST3 mRNA was significantly reduced in the intervertebral disc cells of human subjects carrying the A allele of rs4148941. Together, our data provide new insights into the etiology of LDD, implicating an interplay between genetic risk factors and miRNA.	 8086596 1534724 9345087 9589542 9854746 9883891 10025932 10404573 10470716 15521023 15297300 15817501 15948456 16371896 16595435 17099235 17220213 17701901 17999364 17898028 18304494 18455130 18513679 18698629 19155478 19320654 19338451 20830804 21360499 21393341 21646416 21706480 22120330 22993228 10707396 11172169 11731797 12091876 12639610 15098240 15215498 6495031 2954224 2975064 1948392 1566190 7593075
24064335	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies novel susceptibility loci for obesity.	Obesity is a major public health problem with strong genetic determination. Multiple genetic variants have been implicated for obesity by conducting genome-wide association (GWA) studies, primarily focused on body mass index (BMI). Fat body mass (FBM) is phenotypically more homogeneous than BMI and is more appropriate for obesity research; however, relatively few studies have been conducted on FBM. Aiming to identify variants associated with obesity, we carried out meta-analyses of seven GWA studies for BMI-related traits including FBM, and followed these analyses by de novo replication. The discovery cohorts consisted of 21 969 individuals from diverse ethnic populations and a total of over 4 million genotyped or imputed SNPs. The de novo replication cohorts consisted of 6663 subjects from two independent samples. To complement individual SNP-based association analyses, we also carried out gene-based GWA analyses in which all variations within a gene were considered jointly. Individual SNP-based association analyses identified a novel locus 1q21 [rs2230061, CTSS (Cathepsin S)] that was associated with FBM after the adjustment of lean body mass (LBM) (P = 3.57 × 10(-8)) at the genome-wide significance level. Gene-based association analyses identified a novel gene NLK (nemo-like kinase) in 17q11 that was significantly associated with FBM adjusted by LBM. In addition, we confirmed three previously reported obesity susceptibility loci: 16q12 [rs62033400, P = 1.97 × 10(-14), FTO (fat mass and obesity associated)], 18q22 [rs6567160, P = 8.09 × 10(-19), MC4R (melanocortin 4 receptor)] and 2p25 [rs939583, P = 1.07 × 10(-7), TMEM18 (transmembrane protein 18)]. We also found that rs6567160 may exert pleiotropic effects to both FBM and LBM. Our results provide additional insights into the molecular genetic basis of obesity and may provide future targets for effective prevention and therapeutic intervention. 	 10766250 10937998 11245447 11315092 11748340 12646665 12794229 15272419 1208363 3712713 9492970 9519560 9545015 10391247 14819398 15571588 15703762 15985526 16595758 16614226 16862161 16825321 17378727 17434869 17701901 17890495 17898773 17924335 17943122 18159244 17658951 18454148 18325910 19079260 19079261 19151714 19396169 19503614 19474294 19553259 19715440 19461586 19702646 20164292 20164293 20421936 21824556 21935397 22125221 22013104 22484627 22820512 22844403 20520814 20371568 20598278 20616382 20881960 20935630 20981092 21058334 21552555 21706003 21708048
24133439	Genome-wide association study of autistic-like traits in a general population study of young adults.	Lay abstract: It has been proposed that autistic-like traits in the general population lie on a continuum, with clinical Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), representing the extreme end of this distribution. The current study undertook a genome-wide association (GWA) scan of 965 young Western Australian adults to identify novel risk variants associated with autistic-like traits. No associations reached genome-wide significance; however, a review of nominally associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated two positional candidate loci that have been previously implicated in autistic-like trait etiology. Scientific abstract: Research has proposed that autistic-like traits in the general population lie on a continuum, with clinical ASD representing the extreme end of this distribution. Inherent in this proposal is that biological mechanisms associated with clinical ASD may also underpin variation in autistic-like traits within the general population. A GWA study using 2,462,046 SNPs was undertaken for ASD in 965 individuals from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. No SNP associations reached genome-wide significance (p < 5.0 × 10(-8)). However, investigations into nominal observed SNP associations (p < 1.0 × 10(-5)) add support to two positional candidate genes previously implicated in ASD etiology, PRKCB1, and CBLN1. The rs198198 SNP (p = 9.587 × 10(-6)), is located within an intron of the protein kinase C, beta 1 (PRKCB1) gene on chromosome 16p11. The PRKCB1 gene has been previously reported in linkage and association studies for ASD, and its mRNA expression has been shown to be significantly down regulated in ASD cases compared with controls. The rs16946931 SNP (p = 1.78 × 10(-6)) is located in a region flanking the Cerebellin 1 (CBLN1) gene on chromosome 16q12.1. The CBLN1 gene is involved with synaptogenesis and is part of a gene family previously implicated in ASD. This GWA study is only the second to examine SNPs associated with autistic-like traits in the general population, and provides evidence to support roles for the PRKCB1 and CBLN1 genes in risk of clinical ASD. 	 12742874 24045843 16423148 8105165 22495912 22688012 17167344 15485354 23439483 18317465 19471307 18179893 17600199 21438136 12581816 16806505 16027742 1634591 22253303 17053076 11867360 22169095 23100419 21829684 16319410 19598235 16048517 20233392 19404256 17605173 11439754 20663923 22955989 20634204 22948383 20634369 19503614 17554299 22213788 10576307 20427753 9630255 20012890 20537373
24121790	A genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus.	Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a cancer with rising incidence and poor survival. Most such cancers arise in a specialized intestinal metaplastic epithelium, which is diagnostic of Barrett's esophagus. In a genome-wide association study, we compared esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (n = 2,390) and individuals with precancerous Barrett's esophagus (n = 3,175) with 10,120 controls in 2 phases. For the combined case group, we identified three new associations. The first is at 19p13 (rs10419226: P = 3.6 × 10(-10)) in CRTC1 (encoding CREB-regulated transcription coactivator), whose aberrant activation has been associated with oncogenic activity. A second is at 9q22 (rs11789015: P = 1.0 × 10(-9)) in BARX1, which encodes a transcription factor important in esophageal specification. A third is at 3p14 (rs2687201: P = 5.5 × 10(-9)) near the transcription factor FOXP1, which regulates esophageal development. We also refine a previously reported association with Barrett's esophagus near the putative tumor suppressor gene FOXF1 at 16q24 and extend our findings to now include esophageal adenocarcinoma. 	 4003988 23052040 8443952 8792715 9352846 10235188 15554988 15952094 16211720 16542304 16862161 16899659 17428829 17614763 17701901 18483390 18758446 18758442 19835108 20220756 20616382 20718045 20953190 21058334 21102462 21799872 21926416 22129558 21706049 21984976 22733740 22955989 22955616 22961001 23060615 23504527 1551547
24105470	A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for adiponectin levels in East Asians identifies a novel locus near WDR11-FGFR2.	Blood levels of adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted protein correlated with metabolic and cardiovascular risks, are highly heritable. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies for adiponectin levels have identified 14 loci harboring variants associated with blood levels of adiponectin. To identify novel adiponectin-associated loci, particularly those of importance in East Asians, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWA studies for adiponectin in 7827 individuals, followed by two stages of replications in 4298 and 5954 additional individuals. We identified a novel adiponectin-associated locus on chromosome 10 near WDR11-FGFR2 (P = 3.0 × 10(-14)) and provided suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 12 near OR8S1-LALBA (P = 1.2 × 10(-7)). Of the adiponectin-associated loci previously described, we confirmed the association at CDH13 (P = 6.8 × 10(-165)), ADIPOQ (P = 1.8 × 10(-22)), PEPD (P = 3.6 × 10(-12)), CMIP (P = 2.1 × 10(-10)), ZNF664 (P = 2.3 × 10(-7)) and GPR109A (P = 7.4 × 10(-6)). Conditional analysis at ADIPOQ revealed a second signal with suggestive evidence of association only after conditioning on the lead SNP (Pinitial = 0.020; Pconditional = 7.0 × 10(-7)). We further confirmed the independence of two pairs of closely located loci (<2 Mb) on chromosome 16 at CMIP and CDH13, and on chromosome 12 at GPR109A and ZNF664. In addition, the newly identified signal near WDR11-FGFR2 exhibited evidence of association with triglycerides (P = 3.3 × 10(-4)), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P = 4.9 × 10(-4)) and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted waist-hip ratio (P = 9.8 × 10(-3)). These findings improve our knowledge of the genetic basis of adiponectin variation, demonstrate the shared allelic architecture for adiponectin with lipids and central obesity and motivate further studies of underlying mechanisms. 	 21874001 21104887 21526222 22403302 21267061 20018283 18606306 18359190 22064851 22065538 15931613 11549668 16202386 20876611 20067957 12149104 17164304 21572416 14739054 1400433 20686565 23274890 15132729 20581827 21798870 15531541 20509871 10921906 24009259 22158537 23263489 22344219 20011104 20887962 21909109 19141678 12941784 17886233 21700879 21875899 20634204 17701901 22797727 12588811 22479202 15130516 18684654 23835345 19165915 12687327 12611609 18396371 20413520 16597617 19165155 21771975
24143190	Genome-wide association study of breast cancer in the Japanese population.	Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in worldwide including Japan. Several studies have identified common genetic variants to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. Due to the complex linkage disequilibrium structure and various environmental exposures in different populations, it is essential to identify variants associated with breast cancer in each population, which subsequently facilitate the better understanding of mammary carcinogenesis. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as well as whole-genome imputation with 2,642 cases and 2,099 unaffected female controls. We further examined 13 suggestive loci (P<1.0 × 10(-5)) using an independent sample set of 2,885 cases and 3,395 controls and successfully validated two previously-reported loci, rs2981578 (combined P-value of 1.31 × 10(-12), OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.16-.30) on chromosome 10q26 (FGFR2), rs3803662 (combined P-value of 2.79 × 10(-11), OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.15-.28) and rs12922061 (combined P-value of 3.97 × 10(-10), OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.15-.31) on chromosome 16q12 (TOX3-LOC643714). Weighted genetic risk score on the basis of three significantly associated variants and two previously reported breast cancer associated loci in East Asian population revealed that individuals who carry the most risk alleles in category 5 have 2.2 times higher risk of developing breast cancer in the Japanese population than those who carry the least risk alleles in reference category 1. Although we could not identify additional loci associated with breast cancer, our study utilized one of the largest sample sizes reported to date, and provided genetic status that represent the Japanese population.

We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of two populations, African-American and European-American (AA, EA) for opioid dependence (OD) in three sets of subjects, to identify pathways, genes, and alleles important in OD risk.	 3719049 20098439 23855403 16612103 1871133 17013381 17194218 16862161 15909294 12875050 22072679 1973210 20590401 18458327 21490129 22520967 15995696 16077740 20616382 23453885 15714520 6652378 20018033 18385739 21610080 16642432 23958962 18777128 17701901 18317468 18243582 20981092 19543373 15896927 23732877 17158188
24149102	Variation at 3p24.1 and 6q23.3 influences the risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma.	In addition to HLA, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) have identified susceptibility loci for HL at 2p16.1, 8q24.21 and 10p14. In this study, we perform a GWAS meta-analysis with published GWAS (totalling 1,465 cases and 6,417 controls of European background), and follow-up the most significant association signals in 2,024 cases and 1,853 controls. A combined analysis identifies new HL susceptibility loci mapping to 3p24.1 (rs3806624; P=1.14 × 10(-12), odds ratio (OR)=1.26) and 6q23.3 (rs7745098; P=3.42 × 10(-9), OR=1.21). rs3806624 localizes 5' to the EOMES (eomesodermin) gene within a p53 response element affecting p53 binding. rs7745098 maps intergenic to HBS1L and MYB, a region previously associated with haematopoiesis. These findings provide further insight into the genetic and biological basis of inherited susceptibility to HL. 	 23197535 22532805 21738478 18974171 17895893 21833088 12111919 20657582 21037568 23867303 14605368 20195508 22064851 19017178 21304890 3802833 20817676 17572673 12029063 18635804 22139419 21329961 22286212 22118525 7824015 16155052 19644074 17554300 13655060 22955989 17701901 22086417 16228001 23222517 21596858 15632006 19078975 15812083 19543373 19438470 16224025
24152035	Variants in the 1q21 risk region are associated with a visual endophenotype of autism and schizophrenia.	Deficits in sensitivity to visual stimuli of low spatial frequency and high temporal frequency (so-called frequency-doubled gratings) have been demonstrated both in schizophrenia and in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such basic perceptual functions are ideal candidates for molecular genetic study, because the underlying neural mechanisms are well characterized; but they have sometimes been overlooked in favor of cognitive and neurophysiological endophenotypes, for which neural substrates are often unknown. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of a basic visual endophenotype associated with psychological disorder. Sensitivity to frequency-doubled gratings was measured in 1060 healthy young adults, and analyzed for association with genotype using linear regression at 642 758 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A significant association (P = 7.9 × 10(-9) ) was found with the SNP marker rs1797052, situated in the 5'-untranslated region of PDZK1; each additional copy of the minor allele was associated with an increase in sensitivity equivalent to more than half a standard deviation. A permutation procedure, which accounts for multiple testing, showed that the association was significant at the α = 0.005 level. The region on chromosome 1q21.1 surrounding PDZK1 is an established susceptibility locus both for schizophrenia and for ASD, mirroring the common association of the visual endophenotype with the two disorders. PDZK1 interacts with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and neuroligins, which have been implicated in the etiologies of schizophrenia and ASD. These findings suggest that perceptual abnormalities observed in two different disorders may be linked by common genetic elements. 	
24163127	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci associated with bladder cancer risk.	Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 11 independent susceptibility loci associated with bladder cancer risk. To discover additional risk variants, we conducted a new GWAS of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls, followed by a meta-analysis with two independently published bladder cancer GWAS, resulting in a combined analysis of 6911 cases and 11 814 controls of European descent. TaqMan genotyping of 13 promising single nucleotide polymorphisms with P < 1 × 10(-5) was pursued in a follow-up set of 801 cases and 1307 controls. Two new loci achieved genome-wide statistical significance: rs10936599 on 3q26.2 (P = 4.53 × 10(-9)) and rs907611 on 11p15.5 (P = 4.11 × 10(-8)). Two notable loci were also identified that approached genome-wide statistical significance: rs6104690 on 20p12.2 (P = 7.13 × 10(-7)) and rs4510656 on 6p22.3 (P = 6.98 × 10(-7)); these require further studies for confirmation. In conclusion, our study has identified new susceptibility alleles for bladder cancer risk that require fine-mapping and laboratory investigation, which could further understanding into the biological underpinnings of bladder carcinogenesis. 	 23770605 22955619 17684133 17194218 21297633 16862161 22147365 15342541 17529967 22976474 17943122 22064851 17876321 23284291 23536561 18596976 17060358 20972438 18538025 23118105 21743057 17460697 17003510 19237606 16112301 21824976 17804762 23143601 17529973 23077621 21102463 21037224 19430598 18852200 18587394 20348956 19648920 19151717 20597107 20972440 4008097 16885332 22228101 22955989 18794855 21351269 21833088 22416122 16734859 21708826 18162111 20562874 23727862 19836008 19543373 21750109 18441336

24162737	Meta-analysis of 74,046 individuals identifies 11 new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease.	Eleven susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) were identified by previous studies; however, a large portion of the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained. We conducted a large, two-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls. In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer's disease cases and 11,312 controls. In addition to the APOE locus (encoding apolipoprotein E), 19 loci reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis, of which 11 are newly associated with Alzheimer's disease. 	 21403675 22496871 22706086 22472873 22820502 23237904 23150908 23150934 23565137 23562540 23623698 23399914 24067533 11239437 12972505 15007167 8346443 10187797 10339567 13124110 17220890 17360648 17572673 17194218 17701901 17952075 19543373 19609347 19734902 19734903 19592390 20233392 20460622 20509871 20413860 20616382 20634204 20826339 21085570 21058334 20622515 21292315 21460840 21460841 21378273 21371880 21833088 21835309 21556001 21946561 21860090 22057162
24162738	New loci associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Han Chinese.	Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a challenging global health problem. To identify genetic loci involved in chronic HBV infection, we designed a three-phase genome-wide association study in Han Chinese populations. The discovery phase included 951 HBV carriers (cases) and 937 individuals who had naturally cleared HBV infection (controls) and was followed by independent replications with a total of 2,248 cases and 3,051 controls and additional replications with 1,982 HBV carriers and 2,622 controls from the general population. We identified two new loci associated with chronic HBV infection: rs3130542 at 6p21.33 (near HLA-C, odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, P = 9.49 × 10(-14)) and rs4821116 at 22q11.21 (in UBE2L3, OR = 0.82, P = 1.71 × 10(-12)). Additionally, we replicated the previously identified associations of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ variants at 6p21.32 with chronic HBV infection. These findings highlight the importance of HLA-C and UBE2L3 in the clearance of HBV infection in addition to HLA-DP and HLA-DQ. 	 15230856 12619106 9693040 21402545 20601676 16862161 21750111 20953186 15709024 22105689 3319302 19729084 22138821 21383967 22157327 20190752 6823958 18070287 19349983 21274863 17244158 19217993 12697658 22056847 21904616 21106904 16937459 20502693 19889049 15661683 22496224 22448225 22476155 22737229 22140385 10068598 17701901 21296855 15602165 21346778 6118576 22367481 21408128 22807686 20220756

24204828	Genome-wide contribution of genotype by environment interaction to variation of diabetes-related traits.	While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene approaches have identified many genetic variants that contribute to disease risk as main effects, the impact of genotype by environment (GxE) interactions remains rather under-surveyed. To explore the importance of GxE interactions for diabetes-related traits, a tool for Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) was used to examine GxE variance contribution of 15 macronutrients and lifestyle to the total phenotypic variance of diabetes-related traits at the genome-wide level in a European American population. GCTA identified two key environmental factors making significant contributions to the GxE variance for diabetes-related traits: carbohydrate for fasting insulin (25.1% of total variance, P-nominal = 0.032) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (24.2% of total variance, P-nominal = 0.035), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) for HOMA-β-cell-function (39.0% of total variance, P-nominal = 0.005). To demonstrate and support the results from GCTA, a GxE GWAS was conducted with each of the significant dietary factors and a control E factor (dietary protein), which contributed a non-significant GxE variance. We observed that GxE GWAS for the environmental factor contributing a significant GxE variance yielded more significant SNPs than the control factor. For each trait, we selected all significant SNPs produced from GxE GWAS, and conducted anew the GCTA to estimate the variance they contributed. We noted the variance contributed by these SNPs is higher than that of the control. In conclusion, we utilized a novel method that demonstrates the importance of genome-wide GxE interactions in explaining the variance of diabetes-related traits.	 19474294 17194218 21091714 16862161 22442398 22511877 20562875 15616019 21914258 15479216 9839117 11846115 18319743 21193293 18504548 21119033 19896746 17446329 18254017 22328972 21959352 20581827 21677058 11744511 16968865 22656388 21617109 21142928 17293876 19279076 19812666 22984522 16732014 22228203 18776909 17431185 21167468 20040588 11556298 19202385 11459870 22540253 20693352 19732603

24182552	Novel gene variants predict serum levels of the cytokines IL-18 and IL-1ra in older adults.	Activation of inflammatory pathways measured by serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is strongly associated with the progression of chronic disease states in older adults. Given that these serum cytokine levels are in part a heritable trait, genetic variation may predict increased serum levels. Using the Cardiovascular Health Study and InCHIANTI cohorts, a genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants that influence IL-18 and IL-1ra serum levels among older adults. Multiple linear regression models characterized the association between each SNP and log-transformed cytokine values. Tests for multiple independent signals within statistically significant loci were performed using haplotype analysis and regression models conditional on lead SNP in each region. Multiple SNPs were associated with these cytokines with genome-wide significance, including SNPs in the IL-18-BCO gene region of chromosome 2 for IL-18 (top SNP rs2250417, P=1.9×10(-32)) and in the IL-1 gene family region of chromosome 2 for IL-1ra (rs6743376, P=2.3×10(-26)). Haplotype tests and conditional linear regression models showed evidence of multiple independent signals in these regions. Serum IL-18 levels were also associated with a region on chromosome 2 containing the NLRC4 gene (rs12989936, P=2.7×10(-19)). These data characterize multiple robust genetic signals that influence IL-18 and IL-1ra cytokine production. In particular, the signal for serum IL-18 located on chromosome two is novel and potentially important in inflammasome triggered chronic activation of inflammation in older adults. Replication in independent cohorts is an important next step, as well as molecular studies to better understand the role of NLRC4. 	 11119255 11129752 11791212 11933077 11991722 15208668 1669507 8990222 15345506 15578092 15572589 15954918 16186395 16470011 16611671 17301041 17443229 17701901 17984243 18464913 18451331 18484169 19715440 20031576 20041734 20150558 20354512 19878507 20616382 20178882 21058334 21147462 20978265 21248262 21300955 21145432 21481392 21968104 22015107 22010046 22315422 22205395 22889226 22974247 23689826
24204295	Genome wide analysis of narcolepsy in China implicates novel immune loci and reveals changes in association prior to versus after the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.	Previous studies in narcolepsy, an autoimmune disorder affecting hypocretin (orexin) neurons and recently associated with H1N1 influenza, have demonstrated significant associations with five loci. Using a well-characterized Chinese cohort, we refined known associations in TRA@ and P2RY11-DNMT1 and identified new associations in the TCR beta (TRB@; rs9648789 max P = 3.7 × 10(-9) OR 0.77), ZNF365 (rs10995245 max P = 1.2 × 10(-11) OR 1.23), and IL10RB-IFNAR1 loci (rs2252931 max P = 2.2 × 10(-9) OR 0.75). Variants in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)- DQ region were associated with age of onset (rs7744020 P = 7.9×10(-9) beta -1.9 years) and varied significantly among cases with onset after the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic compared to previous years (rs9271117 P = 7.8 × 10(-10) OR 0.57). These reflected an association of DQB1*03:01 with earlier onset and decreased DQB1*06:02 homozygosity following 2009. Our results illustrate how genetic association can change in the presence of new environmental challenges and suggest that the monitoring of genetic architecture over time may help reveal the appearance of novel triggers for autoimmune diseases.	 21830272 23459209 21170044 23042114 19674163 17384015 22470453 23524042 20711174 21532956 23444425 19433588 22351618 22476154 9459509 22665238 17207713 21866560 23593153 23496005 22328086 22862152 23225098 19725248 22177342 11179016 12458808 17924348 20634204 19412176 21102981 17701901 23486871 23246544 23712092 21257989 21519361 22470463 20041589 22430251 20208533
24172245	A genome-wide association study of third molar agenesis in Japanese and Korean populations.	Tooth agenesis is the most common developmental anomaly of human dentition, occurring most often in the third molar (wisdom tooth). It is affected by genetic variation, so this study aimed to identify susceptibility genes associated with third molar agenesis. Examination of panoramic radiographs and medical history about third molar extraction were used to diagnose third molar agenesis. We then conducted a genome-wide association study of 149 cases with at least one-third molar agenesis and 338 controls from Japan and Korea using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip. After rigorous quality-control filtering, approximately 550 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in association tests with the status. We identified three SNPs showing evidence of association at P<1 × 10(-5) and 69 SNPs showing evidence of association at P<1 × 10(-4). SNP rs1469622, which maps to an intron of THSD7B (thrombospondin, type I, domain containing 7B) on chromosome 2, showed the strongest association (combined odds ratio=1.88, 95% confidence interval=1.43-2.47, P=7.5 × 10(-6)). The identified SNPs may be considered candidates for future replication studies in independent samples.

Here we report results of a large-scale association study of Sjögren's syndrome. In addition to strong association within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21 (Pmeta = 7.65 × 10(-114)), we establish associations with IRF5-TNPO3 (Pmeta = 2.73 × 10(-19)), STAT4 (Pmeta = 6.80 × 10(-15)), IL12A (Pmeta = 1.17 × 10(-10)), FAM167A-BLK (Pmeta = 4.97 × 10(-10)), DDX6-CXCR5 (Pmeta = 1.10 × 10(-8)) and TNIP1 (Pmeta = 3.30 × 10(-8)). We also observed suggestive associations (Pmeta < 5 × 10(-5)) with variants in 29 other regions, including TNFAIP3, PTTG1, PRDM1, DGKQ, FCGR2A, IRAK1BP1, ITSN2 and PHIP, among others. These results highlight the importance of genes that are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity in Sjögren's syndrome.	 20959295 18204098 16477017 21526222 16862161 19458352 20885915 11423179 11393497 20383147 21362769 19286670 17697366 21345260 17943122 20049431 19923232 20535138 12006334 10839798 22490869 15665823 15657875 19169254 18285424 11246470 12368908 22833143 18050197 18311140 22001416 17599733 8468491 22678060 20193048 21336280 17804842 17714766 18984408 21777618 15546391 20639880 12958120 20616382 18163481 19092842 9760569 22289719 15297300 19404300 22464253 20110278 17881657 16632515 20980283 19417065 22286218 18063667 19523788 17412832 20634204 21399635 15888914 17701901 21833088 18204446 23712092 15194588 21750679 20453842 22155868 15880807 18273036 19838195 19116937 22492648 19543373 18286470 19565491 20861858 19721453 12925520 21249183
24076602	Analysis of immune-related loci identifies 48 new susceptibility variants for multiple sclerosis.	Using the ImmunoChip custom genotyping array, we analyzed 14,498 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 24,091 healthy controls for 161,311 autosomal variants and identified 135 potentially associated regions (P < 1.0 × 10(-4)). In a replication phase, we combined these data with previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from an independent 14,802 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 26,703 healthy controls. In these 80,094 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 48 new susceptibility variants (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)), 3 of which we found after conditioning on previously identified variants. Thus, there are now 110 established multiple sclerosis risk variants at 103 discrete loci outside of the major histocompatibility complex. With high-resolution Bayesian fine mapping, we identified five regions where one variant accounted for more than 50% of the posterior probability of association. This study enhances the catalog of multiple sclerosis risk variants and illustrates the value of fine mapping in the resolution of GWAS signals.	 18843511 18974171 22801493 23143596 22384356 19237575 22955986 22922229 21345260 22500001 21852963 19931040 19541911 22936693 23128233 22725956 23037546 23104008 17572673 23315543 19119414 22955616 19128210 19293837 17473310 20517342 22446964 20574445 22466660 16421134 21152010 19525953 20418889 17701901 9989495 21833088 22057235 20362272 17660530 20562413 4113225 19896815 22961000 20601685 22190364 23143594
24236485	Genome-wide association study in NSAID-induced acute urticaria/angioedema in Spanish and Han Chinese populations.	Acute urticaria/angioedema (AUA) induced by cross-intolerance to NSAIDs is the most frequent clinical entity in hypersensitivity reactions to drugs. In this work, we conducted a genome-wide association study in Spanish and Han Chinese patients suffering from NSAID-induced AUA.	
24080446	Genetic modifiers of menopausal hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer risk: a genome-wide interaction study.	Women using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are at increased risk of developing breast cancer (BC). To detect genetic modifiers of the association between current use of MHT and BC risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide case-only studies followed by replication in 11 case-control studies. We used a case-only design to assess interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and current MHT use on risk of overall and lobular BC. The discovery stage included 2920 cases (541 lobular) from four genome-wide association studies. The top 1391 SNPs showing P values for interaction (Pint) <3.0 × 10(-3) were selected for replication using pooled case-control data from 11 studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7689 cases (676 lobular) and 9266 controls. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to derive combined Pint. No SNP reached genome-wide significance in either the discovery or combined stage. We observed effect modification of current MHT use on overall BC risk by two SNPs on chr13 near POMP (combined Pint≤8.9 × 10(-6)), two SNPs in SLC25A21 (combined Pint≤4.8 × 10(-5)), and three SNPs in PLCG2 (combined Pint≤4.5 × 10(-5)). The association between lobular BC risk was potentially modified by one SNP in TMEFF2 (combined Pint≤2.7 × 10(-5)), one SNP in CD80 (combined Pint≤8.2 × 10(-6)), three SNPs on chr17 near TMEM132E (combined Pint≤2.2×10(-6)), and two SNPs on chr18 near SLC25A52 (combined Pint≤4.6 × 10(-5)). In conclusion, polymorphisms in genes related to solute transportation in mitochondria, transmembrane signaling, and immune cell activation are potentially modifying BC risk associated with current use of MHT. These findings warrant replication in independent studies.	 20872241 22427684 12111919 22914469 8122051 16413062 16002670 19559056 23053653 21947678 20232395 21120523 21808267 21791674 11083877 21457551 23435034 15239132 19852806 10933392 21559523 17529973 18506692 15297300 20233392 15217512 19029957 21058334 10613335 12882948 16278609 19861516 19582883 22515609 17701901 21127439 12802030 23535729 20605201 23423446 23544014 19028704 18523454 19370593 14735120
24189344	Common genetic variants on 1p13.2 associate with risk of autism.	Autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, and known genetic variants, mostly rare, account only for a small proportion of cases. Here we report a genome-wide association study on autism using two Chinese cohorts as gene discovery (n=2150) and three data sets of European ancestry populations for replication analysis of top association signals. Meta-analysis identified three single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs936938 (P=4.49 × 10(-8)), non-synonymous rs6537835 (P=3.26 × 10(-8)) and rs1877455 (P=8.70 × 10(-8)), and related haplotypes, AMPD1-NRAS-CSDE1, TRIM33 and TRIM33-BCAS2, associated with autism; all were mapped to a previously reported linkage region (1p13.2) with autism. These genetic associations were further supported by a cis-acting regulatory effect on the gene expressions of CSDE1, NRAS and TRIM33 and by differential expression of CSDE1 and TRIM33 in the human prefrontal cortex of post-mortem brains between subjects with and those without autism. Our study suggests TRIM33 and NRAS-CSDE1 as candidate genes for autism, and may provide a novel insight into the etiology of autism. 	 19404257 21572417 15485354 17363630 22457638 22585064 10889536 22495306 18283277 20865121 19812673 8655659 17173049 20403315 18984147 10072423 24988818 8988171 16644012 19404256 22031444 17236139 20663923 10417292 21614001 17701901 20126254 21658581 12297988 22495311 18184952 16996486 19543373 17273978 20531469 19417063 15197396
24223155	Genome wide analysis of drug-induced torsades de pointes: lack of common variants with large effect sizes.	Marked prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram associated with the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes is a serious adverse event during treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs and other culprit medications, and is a common cause for drug relabeling and withdrawal. Although clinical risk factors have been identified, the syndrome remains unpredictable in an individual patient. Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants. Cases of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (diTdP), treatment tolerant controls, and general population controls were ascertained across multiple sites using common definitions, and genotyped on the Illumina 610k or 1M-Duo BeadChips. Principal Components Analysis was used to select 216 Northwestern European diTdP cases and 771 ancestry-matched controls, including treatment-tolerant and general population subjects. With these sample sizes, there is 80% power to detect a variant at genome-wide significance with minor allele frequency of 10% and conferring an odds ratio of ≥2.7. Tests of association were carried out for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by logistic regression adjusting for gender and population structure. No SNP reached genome wide-significance; the variant with the lowest P value was rs2276314, a non-synonymous coding variant in C18orf21 (p  =  3×10(-7), odds ratio = 2, 95% confidence intervals: 1.5-2.6). The haplotype formed by rs2276314 and a second SNP, rs767531, was significantly more frequent in controls than cases (p  =  3×10(-9)). Expanding the number of controls and a gene-based analysis did not yield significant associations. This study argues that common genomic variants do not contribute importantly to risk for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes across multiple drugs. 	 10878701 22682551 11320260 11997281 12193783 14500332 14614235 14760488 14999113 15090000 2919564 1386493 7692419 15851285 15851319 16075043 16453024 16862161 17242276 17488270 17603472 17701901 17766319 17971785 18398418 18452875 18650507 18760391 18758442 19305408 19305409 19483685 19808499 19843919 21044367 21428769 20517342 21593754 21570397 22100668 22539774 10924311
24244560	A study assessing the association of glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) associated variants with HbA1C, chronic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy in populations of Asian ancestry.	Glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) level is used as a diagnostic marker for diabetes mellitus and a predictor of diabetes associated complications. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with HbA1C level. Most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European ancestry. Here we report the findings from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of HbA1C levels in 6,682 non-diabetic subjects of Chinese, Malay and South Asian ancestries. We also sought to examine the associations between HbA1C associated SNPs and microvascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus, namely chronic kidney disease and retinopathy. A cluster of 6 SNPs on chromosome 17 showed an association with HbA1C which achieved genome-wide significance in the Malays but not in Chinese and Asian Indians. No other variants achieved genome-wide significance in the individual studies or in the meta-analysis. When we investigated the reproducibility of the findings that emerged from the European studies, six loci out of fifteen were found to be associated with HbA1C with effect sizes similar to those reported in the populations of European ancestry and P-value ≤ 0.05. No convincing associations with chronic kidney disease and retinopathy were identified in this study. 	 20858683 17463246 11315092 16862161 22290723 19700652 17943122 16037280 18313502 17365815 10075613 19406920 21873659 17572673 23495396 19096518 23492569 20581827 21188420 18584872 23590421 20616382 19892838 22540250 20978092 17463248 10333940 19401414 18540046 17554300 19016616 16490489 20849430 20042772 18372903 22709419 22617345 18271056 19541915 19543373 19387611
24234648	No evidence for shared genetic basis of common variants in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Genome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying common variants that influence the susceptibility to complex diseases. From these studies, it has emerged that there is substantial overlap in susceptibility loci between diseases. In line with those findings, we hypothesized that shared genetic pathways may exist between multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While both diseases may have inflammatory and neurodegenerative features, epidemiological studies have indicated an increased co-occurrence within individuals and families. To this purpose, we combined genome-wide data from 4088 MS patients, 3762 ALS patients and 12 030 healthy control individuals in whom 5 440 446 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were successfully genotyped or imputed. We tested these SNPs for the excess association shared between MS and ALS and also explored whether polygenic models of SNPs below genome-wide significance could explain some of the observed trait variance between diseases. Genome-wide association meta-analysis of SNPs as well as polygenic analyses fails to provide evidence in favor of an overlap in genetic susceptibility between MS and ALS. Hence, our findings do not support a shared genetic background of common risk variants in MS and ALS. 	 17827064 18843511 21989245 20808933 21253569 18970977 23595949 19823194 18000641 23326272 21852963 17671248 19734901 23946298 21944778 23085936 21349440 3955455 19089474 18084291 20801717 22146612 23349176 17261686 21565411 18395451 21944779 19961850 22269588 12065879 22051914 19525953 17701901 21833088 22678224 18852197 19193627 23665549 11464854 19571811 19092835 22190364
24220699	A common variant at 8q24.21 is associated with renal cell cancer.	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents between 80 and 90% of kidney cancers. Previous genome-wide association studies of RCC have identified five variants conferring risk of the disease. Here we report the results from a discovery RCC genome-wide association study and replication analysis, including a total of 2,411 patients and 71,497 controls. One variant, rs35252396[CG] located at 8q24.21, is significantly associated with RCC after combining discovery and replication results (OR=1.27, P(combined)=5.4 × 10(-11)) and has an average risk allele frequency in controls of 46%. rs35252396[CG] does not have any strongly correlated variants in the genome and is located within a region predicted to have regulatory functions in several cell lines, including six originating from the kidney. This is the first RCC variant reported at 8q24.21 and it is largely independent (r(2)≤0.02) of the numerous previously reported cancer risk variants at this locus.	
24249740	Multistage genome-wide association meta-analyses identified two new loci for bone mineral density.	Aiming to identify novel genetic variants and to confirm previously identified genetic variants associated with bone mineral density (BMD), we conducted a three-stage genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis in 27 061 study subjects. Stage 1 meta-analyzed seven GWA samples and 11 140 subjects for BMDs at the lumbar spine, hip and femoral neck, followed by a Stage 2 in silico replication of 33 SNPs in 9258 subjects, and by a Stage 3 de novo validation of three SNPs in 6663 subjects. Combining evidence from all the stages, we have identified two novel loci that have not been reported previously at the genome-wide significance (GWS; 5.0 × 10(-8)) level: 14q24.2 (rs227425, P-value 3.98 × 10(-13), SMOC1) in the combined sample of males and females and 21q22.13 (rs170183, P-value 4.15 × 10(-9), CLDN14) in the female-specific sample. The two newly identified SNPs were also significant in the GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis consortium (GEFOS, n = 32 960) summary results. We have also independently confirmed 13 previously reported loci at the GWS level: 1p36.12 (ZBTB40), 1p31.3 (GPR177), 4p16.3 (FGFRL1), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 5q14.3 (MEF2C), 6q25.1 (C6orf97, ESR1), 7q21.3 (FLJ42280, SHFM1), 7q31.31 (FAM3C, WNT16), 8q24.12 (TNFRSF11B), 11p15.3 (SOX6), 11q13.4 (LRP5), 13q14.11 (AKAP11) and 16q24 (FOXL1). Gene expression analysis in osteogenic cells implied potential functional association of the two candidate genes (SMOC1 and CLDN14) in bone metabolism. Our findings independently confirm previously identified biological pathways underlying bone metabolism and contribute to the discovery of novel pathways, thus providing valuable insights into the intervention and treatment of osteoporosis. 	 11315092 12130637 18466501 9492970 19056490 12049882 10364154 20072603 12050122 12958120 20616382 16455317 16646809 19801982 19700477 24114349 21533022 21058334 18445777 20359165 23292738 19249006 20634204 19706201 17701901 19079262 20981092 12813049 22504420 21194678 19561606 19543373 23233546 23783100 18455228 19920134 19702646
24241537	A genome-wide association study identifies CDHR3 as a susceptibility locus for early childhood asthma with severe exacerbations.	Asthma exacerbations are among the most frequent causes of hospitalization during childhood, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study of a specific asthma phenotype characterized by recurrent, severe exacerbations occurring between 2 and 6 years of age in a total of 1,173 cases and 2,522 controls. Cases were identified from national health registries of hospitalization, and DNA was obtained from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank. We identified five loci with genome-wide significant association. Four of these, GSDMB, IL33, RAD50 and IL1RL1, were previously reported as asthma susceptibility loci, but the effect sizes for these loci in our cohort were considerably larger than in the previous genome-wide association studies of asthma. We also obtained strong evidence for a new susceptibility gene, CDHR3 (encoding cadherin-related family member 3), which is highly expressed in airway epithelium. These results demonstrate the strength of applying specific phenotyping in the search for asthma susceptibility genes. 	 21752437 17632694 18848899 21682747 22156960 21935397 16687712 22384356 20921080 23128226 22138821 18095172 22064851 15388519 16153740 19815808 20032318 17928596 22820512 12057553 19729670 21347571 19164192 23209423 9309994 18418437 20860503 20517342 19426955 17413031 7767192 20673982 21177656 23086283 21493142 21907864 18805339 17215318 21726430 20159242 19029000 21439619 21804549 19535666 15136376 15521375 10550739 19198610 15980461 21775347 19575812 23103231 2252253
24253340	Genome-wide association study implicates NDST3 in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.	Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are major psychiatric disorders with high heritability and overlapping genetic variance. Here we perform a genome-wide association study in an ethnically homogeneous cohort of 904 schizophrenia cases and 1,640 controls drawn from the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We identify a novel genome-wide significant risk locus at chromosome 4q26, demonstrating the potential advantages of this founder population for gene discovery. The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs11098403) demonstrates consistent effects across 11 replication and extension cohorts, totalling 23, 191 samples across multiple ethnicities, regardless of diagnosis (schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), resulting in Pmeta=9.49 × 10(-12) (odds ratio (OR)=1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.17) across both disorders and Pmeta=2.67 × 10(-8) (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) for schizophrenia alone. In addition, this intergenic SNP significantly predicts postmortem cerebellar gene expression of NDST3, which encodes an enzyme critical to heparan sulphate metabolism. Heparan sulphate binding is critical to neurite outgrowth, axon formation and synaptic processes thought to be aberrant in these disorders. 	 21548950 20548291 21926974 22037552 22037555 22251874 21984068 22344220 22277159 22820512 23103233 23104006 23202125 23933821 10648554 14605369 14997420 15100430 9915799 10025441 15528194 15939841 16404693 16632515 17199051 17151600 17592915 17701901 17804063 17907809 18385133 18715996 18310059 18771588 18814308 19543373 19581566 19571811 19690183 19812321 20159113 20215007 20208533 20616382 20801718 21037240 21926972
24256812	A genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies a novel locus at 17q11.2 associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Identification of mutations at familial loci for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has provided novel insights into the aetiology of this rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disease. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the more common (∼90%) sporadic form have been less successful with the exception of the replicated locus at 9p21.2. To identify new loci associated with disease susceptibility, we have established the largest association study in ALS to date and undertaken a GWAS meta-analytical study combining 3959 newly genotyped Italian individuals (1982 cases and 1977 controls) collected by SLAGEN (Italian Consortium for the Genetics of ALS) together with samples from Netherlands, USA, UK, Sweden, Belgium, France, Ireland and Italy collected by ALSGEN (the International Consortium on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetics). We analysed a total of 13 225 individuals, 6100 cases and 7125 controls for almost 7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified a novel locus with genome-wide significance at 17q11.2 (rs34517613 with P = 1.11 × 10(-8); OR 0.82) that was validated when combined with genotype data from a replication cohort (P = 8.62 × 10(-9); OR 0.833) of 4656 individuals. Furthermore, we confirmed the previously reported association at 9p21.2 (rs3849943 with P = 7.69 × 10(-9); OR 1.16). Finally, we estimated the contribution of common variation to heritability of sporadic ALS as ∼12% using a linear mixed model accounting for all SNPs. Our results provide an insight into the genetic structure of sporadic ALS, confirming that common variation contributes to risk and that sufficiently powered studies can identify novel susceptibility loci. 	 20345246 20137488 20225930 20801717 20861059 21167468 19464757 21295378 20517342 19525032 21944778 21944779 22154785 22678360 22837513 22820511 22727276 22766072 22753137 22892372 22959728 23193196 23624525 23737753 10540001 12792141 12958120 15837585 16862161 17071060 17362836 17574095 17572673 17194218 17701901 17671248 17786212 17827064 18084291 18057069 19193627 19543373 19734901 19734903 19915575 20616382

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence a patient's response to inhaled corticosteroids and β2-agonists, and the effect of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is synergistic with the effect of β2-agonists. We hypothesized that use of inhaled corticosteroids could influence the effect of SNPs associated with a bronchodilator response.	 10619834 22370858 11897997 14610472 15128701 15500895 8383511 7840227 8834349 15879435 17068223 17507702 18086493 18408560 18617639 19783676 20356460 20673984 20634204 22792082 10984540
24280982	Polygenic dissection of diagnosis and clinical dimensions of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.	Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two often severe disorders with high heritabilities. Recent studies have demonstrated a large overlap of genetic risk loci between these disorders but diagnostic and molecular distinctions still remain. Here, we perform a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 19 779 bipolar disorder (BP) and schizophrenia (SCZ) cases versus 19 423 controls, in addition to a direct comparison GWAS of 7129 SCZ cases versus 9252 BP cases. In our case-control analysis, we identify five previously identified regions reaching genome-wide significance (CACNA1C, IFI44L, MHC, TRANK1 and MAD1L1) and a novel locus near PIK3C2A. We create a polygenic risk score that is significantly different between BP and SCZ and show a significant correlation between a BP polygenic risk score and the clinical dimension of mania in SCZ patients. Our results indicate that first, combining diseases with similar genetic risk profiles improves power to detect shared risk loci and second, that future direct comparisons of BP and SCZ are likely to identify loci with significant differential effects. Identifying these loci should aid in the fundamental understanding of how these diseases differ biologically. These findings also indicate that combining clinical symptom dimensions and polygenic signatures could provide additional information that may someday be used clinically. 	 7944874 23212062 9881538 10781914 11925290 12223257 12795498 14662553 14685227 354552 7214104 7072845 3616518 1970815 2190539 1883262 1637251 1637252 8317947 8215813 8192190 15618952 15916472 17433450 17383856 17701901 19150704 22182935 23453885 23637625 22614287 18711365 19144440 19200528 19198609 19571811 20368704 21483432 21926972 21972277 22688191 7726316
24277619	ALDH2 is associated to alcohol dependence and is the major genetic determinant of "daily maximum drinks" in a GWAS study of an isolated rural Chinese sample.	Alcohol dependence (AD) is a moderately heritable phenotype with a small number of known risk genes mapped via linkage or candidate gene studies. We considered 313 males from among 595 members of documented, extended pedigrees in which AD segregates collected in Northern Hunan Province, China. A joint analysis of both males and females could not be performed as the difference in alcohol consumption variance was too large. Genome-wide association analyses were performed for approximately 300,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Significant associations found in the ALDH2 region for AD (minimum P = 4.73 × 10(-8)) and two AD-related phenotypes: flushing response (minimum P = 4.75 × 10(-26)) and maximum drinks in a 24-hr period (minimum P = 1.54 × 10(-16)). Association of previous candidate SNP, rs10774610 in CCDC63, was confirmed but resulted from linkage disequilibrium with ALDH2. ALDH2 is strongly associated with flushing response, AD, and maximum drinks in males, with nonsynonymous SNP rs671 explaining 29.2%, 7.9%, and 22.9% of phenotypic variation, respectively, in this sample. When rs671 was considered as a candidate SNP in females, it explained 23.6% of the variation in flushing response, but alcohol consumption rates were too low among females-despite familial enrichment for AD-for an adequate test of association for either AD or maximum drinks. These results support a mediating effect of aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency on alcohol consumption in males and a secondary, culturally mediated limitation on alcohol consumption by females that should be appropriately modeled in future studies of alcohol consumption in populations where this may be a factor.	 11252747 9700192 11424994 11588394 15685625 15909294 16269918 15896927 16341909 16550213 17718394 18538955 19320537 18414406 19581569 19576574 20374207 20379614 21372407 21471458 21497796 21529783 21689117 22320931 22102315 22613542 22476623 23364009 23089632 19474294 11593451 11772476 11791215 12566741 14633640 14691074 8512527 8189735 8651310 8651467 9419411 9545414 11377961
24281739	Is the gene-environment interaction paradigm relevant to genome-wide studies? The case of education and body mass index.	This study uses data from the Framingham Heart Study to examine the relevance of the gene-environment interaction paradigm for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We use completed college education as our environmental measure and estimate the interactive effect of genotype and education on body mass index (BMI) using 260,402 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results highlight the sensitivity of parameter estimates obtained from GWAS models and the difficulty of framing genome-wide results using the existing gene-environment interaction typology. We argue that SNP-environment interactions across the human genome are not likely to provide consistent evidence regarding genetic influences on health that differ by environment. Nevertheless, genome-wide data contain rich information about individual respondents, and we demonstrate the utility of this type of data. We highlight the fact that GWAS is just one use of genome-wide data, and we encourage demographers to develop methods that incorporate this vast amount of information from respondents into their analyses. 	 23062291 22199029 11227843 22199026 12869766 17372189 19846689 20562875 12108763 22199027 21552263 22199399 21262036 18619402 22665028 20087641 12503980 18252231 23236222 22328972 19883141 17634446 17566051 12704011 12883005 22843982 14535962 21376301 16619052 17453060 10953804 17903300 15863711 21308767 15768043 17495196 19531786 11943585 7560851 19812666 17236545 16614226 21845502 17701901 18347970 18391952 19046654 20608103 16741273 18845469 21909182 21167468 11055368 22253363 21308768 21283825 16246381 20650819 16389207 22087252
24282030	A genome-wide association study identifies polymorphisms in the HLA-DR region associated with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination in Chinese Han populations.	Vaccination against hepatitis B virus is an effective and routine practice that can prevent infection. However, 5-10% of healthy adults fail to produce protective levels of antibody against the hepatitis B vaccination. It has been reported that host genetic variants might affect the immune response to hepatitis B vaccination. Here, we reported a genome-wide association study in a Chinese Han population consisting of 108 primary high-responders and 77 booster non-responders to hepatitis B vaccination using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress Beadchip. We identified 21 SNPs at 6p21.32 were significantly associated with non-response to booster hepatitis B vaccination (P-value <1 × 10(-6)). The most significant SNP in the region was rs477515, located ∼12 kb upstream of the HLA-DRB1 gene. Its P-value (4.81 × 10(-8)) exceeded the Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold. Four tagging SNPs (rs477515, rs28366298, rs3763316 and rs13204672) that capture genetic information of these 21 SNPs were validated in three additional Chinese Han populations, consisting of 1336 primary high-responders and 420 primary non-responders. The four SNPs continued to show significant associations with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination (P-combined = 3.98 × 10(-13)- 1.42 × 10(-8)). Further analysis showed that the rs477515 was independently associated with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination with correction for other three SNPs in our GWAS and the known hepatitis B vaccine immunity associated SNP in previous GWAS. Our findings suggest that the rs477515 was an independent marker associated with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination and HLA-DR region might be a critical susceptibility locus of hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity. 	
23918589	A genome-wide association study reveals ARL15, a novel non-HLA susceptibility gene for rheumatoid arthritis in North Indians.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their subsequent meta-analyses have changed the landscape of genetics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by uncovering several novel genes. Such studies are heavily weighted by samples from Caucasian populations, but they explain only a small proportion of total heritability. Our previous studies in genetically distinct North Indian RA cohorts have demonstrated apparent allelic/genetic heterogeneity between North Indian and Western populations, warranting GWAS in non-European populations. We undertook this study to detect additional disease-associated loci that may be collectively important in the presence or absence of genes with a major effect.	
24292274	A genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have shown that common genetic variation contributes to the heritable risk of CLL. To identify additional CLL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1,739 individuals with CLL (cases) and 5,199 controls with validation in an additional 1,144 cases and 3,151 controls. A combined analysis identified new susceptibility loci mapping to 3q26.2 (rs10936599, P = 1.74 × 10(-9)), 4q26 (rs6858698, P = 3.07 × 10(-9)), 6q25.2 (IPCEF1, rs2236256, P = 1.50 × 10(-10)) and 7q31.33 (POT1, rs17246404, P = 3.40 × 10(-8)). Additionally, we identified a promising association at 5p15.33 (CLPTM1L, rs31490, P = 1.72 × 10(-7)) and validated recently reported putative associations at 5p15.33 (TERT, rs10069690, P = 1.12 × 10(-10)) and 8q22.3 (rs2511714, P = 2.90 × 10(-9)). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CLL. 	 17170732 23955597 23770605 17895893 22941192 18758461 20101243 12111919 20657582 22581853 17481586 19286886 18715499 14962897 17658394 22064851 18978787 15965027 20972438 12029063 15687363 19578363 20062064 23535731 14671650 16155052 23620080 10477713 21983787 23640991 20972440 22955989 23535734 17701901 16228001 21708826 22700719 23502782 20702402 22037553 16224025 22899579 12000852
24778558	RTN4 and FBXL17 Genes are Associated with Coronary Heart Disease in Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Lithuanian Families.	Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a complex and heterogeneous cardiovascular disease. There are many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed worldwide to extract the causative genetic factors. Moreover, each population may have some exceptional genetic characteristic. Thus, the background of our study is from the previous Lithuanian studies (the LiVicordia Project), which demonstrated the differences of the atherosclerosis process between Lithuanian and Swedish male individuals. In this study we performed GWAS of 32 families of Lithuanian origin in search of significant candidate genetic markers [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] of CHD in this population. After careful clinical and biochemical phenotype evaluation, the ∼770K SNPs genotyping (Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 v1.0 array) and familial GWAS analyses were performed. Twelve SNPs were found to be significantly associated with the CHD phenotype (p value <0.0001; the power >0.65). The odds ratio (OR) values were calculated. Two SNPs (rs17046570 in the RTN4 gene and rs11743737 in the FBXL17 gene) stood out and may prove to be important genetic factors for CHD risk. Our results correspond with the findings in other studies, and these two SNPs may be the susceptibility loci for CHD. 	 15034570 21563301 17903299 15520277 19892772 17413036 16505527 8447318 19723497 22555213 19430480 16083318 20717916 17701901 12225610

24324648	Genome-wide association study for levels of total serum IgE identifies HLA-C in a Japanese population.	Most of the previously reported loci for total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are related to Th2 cell-dependent pathways. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic loci responsible for IgE regulation. A total of 479,940 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with total serum IgE levels in 1180 Japanese adults. Fine-mapping with SNP imputation demonstrated 6 candidate regions: the PYHIN1/IFI16, MHC classes I and II, LEMD2, GRAMD1B, and chr13∶60576338 regions. Replication of these candidate loci in each region was assessed in 2 independent Japanese cohorts (n = 1110 and 1364, respectively). SNP rs3130941 in the HLA-C region was consistently associated with total IgE levels in 3 independent populations, and the meta-analysis yielded genome-wide significance (P = 1.07×10(-10)). Using our GWAS results, we also assessed the reproducibility of previously reported gene associations with total IgE levels. Nine of 32 candidate genes identified by a literature search were associated with total IgE levels after correction for multiple testing.

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a stable index of chronic glycemic status and hyperglycemia associated with progressive development of insulin resistance and frank diabetes. It is also associated with premature aging and increased mortality. To uncover novel loci for HbA1c that are associated with healthy aging, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using non-diabetic participants in the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), a study with familial clustering of exceptional longevity in the US and Denmark.	 15140424 15288366 7137154 2646917 15734873 16862161 16934002 17285797 18048707 19096518 11872688 12588575 19118288 19502545 19715440 19910380 20042774 19875614 20103712 20714348 20864672 21058334 20858683 21258136 21975967 22333004 22498246

24325915	Genome-wide association study identifies 25 known breast cancer susceptibility loci as risk factors for triple-negative breast cancer.	Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with a unique set of epidemiologic and genetic risk factors. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of TN breast cancer (stage 1: 1529 TN cases, 3399 controls; stage 2: 2148 cases, 1309 controls) to identify loci that influence TN breast cancer risk. Variants in the 19p13.1 and PTHLH loci showed genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-) (8)) in stage 1 and 2 combined. Results also suggested a substantial enrichment of significantly associated variants among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in stage 2. Variants from 25 of 74 known breast cancer susceptibility loci were also associated with risk of TN breast cancer (P < 0.05). Associations with TN breast cancer were confirmed for 10 loci (LGR6, MDM4, CASP8, 2q35, 2p24.1, TERT-rs10069690, ESR1, TOX3, 19p13.1, RALY), and we identified associations with TN breast cancer for 15 additional breast cancer loci (P < 0.05: PEX14, 2q24.1, 2q31.1, ADAM29, EBF1, TCF7L2, 11q13.1, 11q24.3, 12p13.1, PTHLH, NTN4, 12q24, BRCA2, RAD51L1-rs2588809, MKL1). Further, two SNPs independent of previously reported signals in ESR1 [rs12525163 odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, P = 4.9 × 10(-) (4)] and 19p13.1 (rs1864112 OR = 0.84, P = 1.8 × 10(-) (9)) were associated with TN breast cancer. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for TN breast cancer based on known breast cancer risk variants showed a 4-fold difference in risk between the highest and lowest PRS quintiles (OR = 4.03, 95% confidence interval 3.46-4.70, P = 4.8 × 10(-) (69)). This translates to an absolute risk for TN breast cancer ranging from 0.8% to 3.4%, suggesting that genetic variation may be used for TN breast cancer risk prediction. 	 2253214 23717510 15790698 17387718 18000216 18245468 17578664 18974171 19723659 19189211 21067385 21596841 21844186 21795498 21852249 22039763 22037553 22064851 22331459 22955616 22976474 23535729 23535731 23535733 23536562 23540573 23360712 23515291 8709404
24325914	A genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis identifies an epistatic gene pair for lung cancer susceptibility in Han Chinese.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. By now, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with the risk of developing lung cancer. However, these loci account for only a small fraction of the familial lung cancer risk. We hypothesized that epistasis may contribute to the missing heritability. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluated the association of epistasis of genetic variants with risk of lung cancer in Han Chinese cohorts. We conducted a pairwise genetic interaction analysis of 591370 variants, using BOolean Operation-based Screening and Testing (BOOST), in an ongoing GWAS of lung cancer that includes 2331 cases and 3077 controls. Pairs of epistatic loci with P BOOST ≤ 1.00×10(-6) were further evaluated by a logistic regression model (LRM) with covariate adjustment. Four promising epistatic pairs identified at the screening stage (P LRM ≤ 2.86×10(-) (13)) were validated in two replication cohorts: the first from Beijing (1534 cases and 1489 controls) and the second from Shenyang and Guangzhou (2512 cases and 2449 controls). Using this combined analysis, we identified an interaction between rs2562796 and rs16832404 at 2p32.2 that was significantly associated with the risk of developing lung cancer (P LRM = 1.03×10(-13) in total 13 392 subjects). This study is the first investigation of epistasis for lung cancer on a genome-wide scale in Han Chinese. It addresses part of the missing heritability in lung cancer risk and provides novel insight into the multifactorial etiology of lung cancer.	 18978790 23143601 19733727 19812666 19434077 20817139 21133856 10690417 10747296 10891514 11901921 12351582 14518977 14748743 15279797 15761078 16807412 16862161 17202451 17283436 17569110 18385738 18385676 18509313 18776909 18978787 21351269 21616630 21725308 22331944 21744313 22623965 22367438 22797724 22797725 19085751
24322204	Genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder accounting for effect of body mass index identifies a new risk allele in TCF7L2.	Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and increased metabolic comorbidity. Considering the associated phenotypic traits in genetic studies of complex diseases, either by adjusting for covariates or by investigating interactions between genetic variants and covariates, may help to uncover the missing heritability. However, obesity-related traits have not been incorporated in prior genome-wide analyses of BD as covariates or potential interacting factors. To investigate the genetic factors underlying BD while considering BMI, we conducted genome-wide analyses using data from the Genetic Association Information Network BD study. We analyzed 729,454 genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers on 388 European-American BD cases and 1020 healthy controls with available data for maximum BMI. We performed genome-wide association analyses of the genetic effects while accounting for the effect of maximum BMI, and also evaluated SNP-BMI interactions. A joint test of main and interaction effects demonstrated significant evidence of association at the genome-wide level with rs12772424 in an intron of TCF7L2 (P=2.85E-8). This SNP exhibited interaction effects, indicating that the bipolar susceptibility risk of this SNP is dependent on BMI. TCF7L2 codes for the transcription factor TCF/LF, part of the Wnt canonical pathway, and is one of the strongest genetic risk variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D). This is consistent with BD pathophysiology, as the Wnt pathway has crucial implications in neurodevelopment, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, and is involved in the mechanisms of action of BD and depression treatments. We hypothesize that genetic risk for BD is BMI dependent, possibly related to common genetic risk with T2D.	 23256519 23395445 23395446 15163249 16862161 17968353 18704095 21926972 20029406 22205198 21821916 17898773 19150704 8710892 22325160 22820512 18599616 23044246 19708029 18711365 12742871 16402135 20182623 19056611 17609372 23742827 23024173 23290497 22903246 19465938 11381089 17283440 19820914 22581228 18657245 21353194 17299510 21490598 17554300 21876473 23685202 23269371 22426310 23431017 8757136 22765916 22319467 21239163 12796505 18191226 19488044 15282284
24376456	Gene-alcohol interactions identify several novel blood pressure loci including a promising locus near SLC16A9.	Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for hypertension, with recent candidate studies implicating gene-alcohol interactions in blood pressure (BP) regulation. We used 6882 (predominantly) Caucasian participants aged 20-80 years from the Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) to perform a genome-wide analysis of SNP-alcohol interactions on BP traits. We used a two-step approach in the ABEL suite to examine genetic interactions with three alcohol measures (ounces of alcohol consumed per week, drinks consumed per week, and the number of days drinking alcohol per week) on four BP traits [systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean arterial (MAP), and pulse (PP) pressure]. In the first step, we fit a linear mixed model of each BP trait onto age, sex, BMI, and antihypertensive medication while accounting for the phenotypic correlation among relatives. In the second step, we conducted 1 degree-of-freedom (df) score tests of the SNP main effect, alcohol main effect, and SNP-alcohol interaction using the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameters from the first step. We then calculated the joint 2 df score test of the SNP main effect and SNP-alcohol interaction using MixABEL. The effect of SNP rs10826334 (near SLC16A9) on SBP was significantly modulated by both the number of alcoholic drinks and the ounces of alcohol consumed per week (p-values of 1.27E-08 and 3.92E-08, respectively). Each copy of the G-allele decreased SBP by 3.79 mmHg in those consuming 14 drinks per week vs. a 0.461 mmHg decrease in non-drinkers. Index SNPs in 20 other loci exhibited suggestive (p-value ≤ 1E-06) associations with BP traits by the 1 df interaction test or joint 2 df test, including 3 rare variants, one low-frequency variant, and SNPs near/in genes ESRRG, FAM179A, CRIPT-SOCS5, KAT2B, ADCY2, GLI3, ZNF716, SLIT1, PDE3A, KERA-LUM, RNF219-AS1, CLEC3A, FBXO15, and IGSF5. SNP-alcohol interactions may enhance discovery of novel variants with large effects that can be targeted with lifestyle modifications. 	 23615284 11315092 18974171 17372189 15803198 23111423 17903302 21734701 19487301 17384015 19022827 23588856 21746850 15947021 21934325 21675276 22064851 22576626 19609347 22384028 21909110 11711507 21572416 19430479 22179539 19084543 23239837 17510502 20878543 11711505 19503597 22932875 19562039 11358935 16884666 21429274 21045733 20233392 14688809 22551939 20409912 1208363 22122337 22839215 19430483 21378095 20212493 20634204 21909115 23324992 21307933 16375734 14819398 22000651 21082022
24379826	Genome-wide association analysis confirms and extends the association of SLC2A9 with serum uric acid levels to Mexican Americans.	Increased serum uric acid (SUA) is a risk factor for gout and renal and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to identify genetic factors that affect the variation in SUA in 632 Mexican Americans participants of the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). A genome-wide association (GWA) analysis was performed using the Illumina Human Hap 550K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. We used a linear regression-based association test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for non-independence among family members via a kinship variance component. All analyses were performed in the software package SOLAR. SNPs rs6832439, rs13131257, and rs737267 in solute carrier protein 2 family, member 9 (SLC2A9) were associated with SUA at genome-wide significance (p < 1.3 × 10(-7)). The minor alleles of these SNPs had frequencies of 36.2, 36.2, and 38.2%, respectively, and were associated with decreasing SUA levels. All of these SNPs were located in introns 3-7 of SLC2A9, the location of the previously reported associations in European populations. When analyzed for association with cardiovascular-renal disease risk factors, conditional on SLC2A9 SNPs strongly associated with SUA, significant associations were found for SLC2A9 SNPs with BMI, body weight, and waist circumference (p < 1.4 × 10(-3)) and suggestive associations with albumin-creatinine ratio and total antioxidant status (TAS). The SLC2A9 gene encodes an urate transporter that has considerable influence on variation in SUA. In addition to the primary association locus, suggestive evidence (p < 1.9 × 10(-6)) for joint linkage/association (JLA) was found at a previously-reported urate quantitative trait locus (Logarithm of odds score = 3.6) on 3p26.3. In summary, our GWAS extends and confirms the association of SLC2A9 with SUA for the first time in a Mexican American cohort and also shows for the first time its association with cardiovascular-renal disease risk factors. 	 20972595 10391028 18987709 22189840 18487473 22229870 3435047 18443212 21186168 14578304 19260141 17531180 20588307 19593129 8651310 1914812 22384520 19506252 22132962 11342800 17978310 10355381 7106756 22000645 10798367 20714133 17130256 21808278 18398472 21294900 21835317 23239837 16598194 3366463 13723138 19706426 12707287 19026395 16253630 18842065 19503597 18327256 19723617 18834626 19590895 22503466 5641843 11731797 23263486 9545414 2368810 19812666 15660329 21584282 18327257 19654543 22939038 21768215 18606621 12372787 18759275 16932373 20884846 19001525 18179892 19258383 17997608 22445470 23552988
24347629	Genome-wide association study of periodontal health measured by probing depth in adults ages 18-49 years.	The etiology of chronic periodontitis clearly includes a heritable component. Our purpose was to perform a small exploratory genome-wide association study in adults ages 18-49 years to nominate genes associated with periodontal disease-related phenotypes for future consideration. Full-mouth periodontal pocket depth probing was performed on participants (N = 673), with affected status defined as two or more sextants with probing depths of 5.5 mm or greater. Two variations of this phenotype that differed in how missing teeth were treated were used in analysis. More than 1.2 million genetic markers across the genome were genotyped or imputed and tested for genetic association. We identified ten suggestive loci (p-value ≤ 1E-5), including genes/loci that have been previously implicated in chronic periodontitis: LAMA2, HAS2, CDH2, ESR1, and the genomic region on chromosome 14q21-22 between SOS2 and NIN. Moreover, we nominated novel loci not previously implicated in chronic periodontitis or related pathways, including the regions 3p22 near OSBPL10 (a lipid receptor implicated in hyperlipidemia), 4p15 near HSP90AB2P (a heat shock pseudogene), 11p15 near GVINP1 (a GTPase pseudogene), 14q31 near SEL1L (an intracellular transporter), and 18q12 in FHOD3 (an actin cytoskeleton regulator). Replication of these results in additional samples is needed. This is one of the first research efforts to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with chronic periodontitis-related phenotypes by the genome-wide association study approach. Though small, efforts such this are needed in order to nominate novel genes and generate new hypotheses for exploration and testing in future studies. 	 12194965 11128917 21372518 21226845 18522740 19722800 20718045 12097432 24024966 18218840 16109987 21501239 11931220 22699663 10505807 11868160 20524935 21091323 10052767 22133366 9545414 19897590 15843373 21180677 17701901 18256235 15731052 23459936

24357727	A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies ORM1 as a novel gene controlling thrombin generation potential.	Thrombin, the major enzyme of the hemostatic system, is involved in biological processes associated with several human diseases. The capacity of a given individual to generate thrombin, called the thrombin generation potential (TGP), can be robustly measured in plasma and was shown to associate with thrombotic disorders. To investigate the genetic architecture underlying the interindividual TGP variability, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 2 discovery samples (N = 1967) phenotyped for 3 TGP biomarkers, the endogenous thrombin potential, the peak height, and the lag time, and replicated the main findings in 2 independent studies (N = 1254). We identified the ORM1 gene, coding for orosomucoid, as a novel locus associated with lag time variability, reflecting the initiation process of thrombin generation with a combined P value of P = 7.1 × 10(-15) for the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs150611042). This SNP was also observed to associate with ORM1 expression in monocytes (P = 8.7 × 10(-10)) and macrophages (P = 3.2 × 10(-3)). In vitro functional experiments further demonstrated that supplementing normal plasma with increasing orosomucoid concentrations was associated with impaired thrombin generation. These results pave the way for novel mechanistic pathways and therapeutic perspectives in the etiology of thrombin-related disorders. 	
24376798	HLA-DQB1*03 confers susceptibility to chronic hepatitis C in Japanese: a genome-wide association study.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes a chronic infection in 70-80% of infected individuals. Many researchers have examined the effect of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on viral persistence because of its critical role in the immune response against exposure to HCV, but almost all studies have proven to be inconclusive. To identify genetic risk factors for chronic HCV infection, we analyzed 458,207 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 481 chronic HCV patients and 2,963 controls in a Japanese cohort. Next, we performed a replication study with an independent panel of 4,358 cases and 1,114 controls. We further confirmed the association in 1,379 cases and 25,817 controls. In the GWAS phase, we found 17 SNPs that showed suggestive association (P < 1 × 10⁻⁵). After the first replication study, we found one intronic SNP in the HLA-DQ locus associated with chronic HCV infection, and when we combined the two studies, the association reached the level of genome-wide significance. In the second replication study, we again confirmed the association (P(combined) = 3.59 × 10⁻¹⁶, odds ratio [OR] = 0.79). Subsequent analysis revealed another SNP, rs1130380, with a stronger association (OR=0.72). This nucleotide substitution causes an amino acid substitution (R55P) in the HLA-DQB1 protein specific to the DQB1*03 allele, which is common worldwide. In addition, we confirmed an association with the previously reported IFNL3-IFNL4 locus and propose that the effect of DQB1*03 on HCV persistence might be affected by the IFNL4 polymorphism. Our findings suggest that a common amino acid substitution in HLA-DQB1 affects susceptibility to chronic infection with HCV in the Japanese population and may not be independent of the IFNL4 genotype.	 11501945 12694584 21750111 19853955 15044834 17982410 23188091 19759533 21112660 23420232 17465466 18638659 14769912 15297676 19434718 9425943 9581697 19349983 9155590 16122679 23242368 15297300 7533121 20060832 18817904 19207969 16434426 17701901 7635408 21228123 21535077 23291588 22524382 18477402 21499248

This study is the first to use genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to evaluate the multidimensional genetic architecture underlying nasopharyngeal cancer. Since analysis of data from GWAS confirms a close and consistent association between elevated risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and major histocompatibility complex class 1 genes, our goal here was to explore lesser effects of gene-gene interactions. We conducted an exhaustive genome-wide analysis of GWAS data of NPC, revealing two-locus interactions occurring between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identified a number of suggestive interaction loci which were missed by traditional GWAS analyses. Although none of the interaction pairs we identified passed the genome-wide Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for significance, using independent GWAS data from the same population (Stage 2), we selected 66 SNP pairs in 39 clusters with P<0.01. We identified that in several chromosome regions, multiple suggestive interactions group to form a block-like signal, effectively reducing the rate of false discovery. The strongest cluster of interactions involved the CREB5 gene and a SNP rs1607979 on chromosome 17q22 (P = 9.86×10(-11)) which also show trans-expression quantitative loci (eQTL) association in Chinese population. We then detected a complicated cis-interaction pattern around the NPC-associated HLA-B locus, which is immediately adjacent to copy-number variations implicated in male susceptibility for NPC. While it remains to be seen exactly how and to what degree SNP-SNP interactions such as these affect susceptibility for nasopharyngeal cancer, future research on these questions holds great promise for increasing our understanding of this disease's genetic etiology, and possibly also that of other gene-related cancers. 	 11791212 23209447 12464650 14585768 10213566 15297300 15793588 16213214 16862161 17234809 17701901 18200600 19369657 19664746 19812666 19449168 20074509 19434077 20133699 20479774 20453196 20512145 20702402 20953190 21133856 21115973 21437271 21536588 21481336 21743469 21886828 22086326 22223662 22245473 22300735 22532805 22654671 22500023 22367438 22333899 22787146 11867360
24390345	Sequence variants in SLC16A11 are a common risk factor for type 2 diabetes in Mexico.	Performing genetic studies in multiple human populations can identify disease risk alleles that are common in one population but rare in others, with the potential to illuminate pathophysiology, health disparities, and the population genetic origins of disease alleles. Here we analysed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at ~50% frequency in Native American samples and ~10% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.	 20448178 20395969 20581827 20581678 21403394 22131303 22162139 23144628 23128226 22385956 20585724 22560215 22883141 22936568 12824425 8124722 16415884 17194218 17701901 18711367 18711366 19543373 19526211 19648217 19805257
24390342	Genetics of rheumatoid arthritis contributes to biology and drug discovery.	A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic strategy to integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic and biological data sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating ∼10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.	 18979150 22446963 19557189 19567438 20453842 20714348 20952405 21059682 21249183 22150039 21948793 22075990 22286218 22491277 22446960 19474294 22797727 23128226 23143596 12724780 3358796 17344885 18209094 23263488 23374262 23172750 23593036 23749187 23868113 24013639
24468470	Genetic susceptibility to accelerated cognitive decline in the US Health and Retirement Study.	Age-related cognitive decline is a major public health concern facing a large segment of the US population. To identify genetic risk factors related to cognitive decline, we used nationally representative longitudinal data from the US Health and Retirement Study to conduct genome-wide association studies with 5765 participants of European ancestry, and 890 participants of African ancestry. Mixed effects models were used to derive cognitive decline phenotypes from data on repeated cognitive assessments and to perform single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability estimation. We found 2 independent associations among European-Americans in the 19q13.32 region: rs769449 (APOE intron; p = 3.1 × 10(-20)) and rs115881343 (TOMM40 intron; p = 6.6 × 10(-11)). rs769449 was also associated with cognitive decline among African-Americans (p = 0.005), but rs115881343 was not. Cross-sectional cognitive function showed moderate heritability (15%-32%) across several age strata (50-59, 60-69, 70-79 years), but the cognitive decline heritability estimate was low (∼5%). These results indicate that despite multiple association signals for cognitive decline in the 19q13.32 region, inter-individual variation is likely influenced substantially by environmental factors.	
24375517	Genome-wide association study in musician's dystonia: a risk variant at the arylsulfatase G locus?	Musician's dystonia (MD) affects 1% to 2% of professional musicians and frequently terminates performance careers. It is characterized by loss of voluntary motor control when playing the instrument. Little is known about genetic risk factors, although MD or writer's dystonia (WD) occurs in relatives of 20% of MD patients. We conducted a 2-stage genome-wide association study in whites. Genotypes at 557,620 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) passed stringent quality control for 127 patients and 984 controls. Ten SNPs revealed P < 10(-5) and entered the replication phase including 116 MD patients and 125 healthy musicians. A genome-wide significant SNP (P < 5 × 10(-8) ) was also genotyped in 208 German or Dutch WD patients, 1,969 Caucasian, Spanish, and Japanese patients with other forms of focal or segmental dystonia as well as in 2,233 ethnically matched controls. Genome-wide significance with MD was observed for an intronic variant in the arylsulfatase G (ARSG) gene (rs11655081; P = 3.95 × 10(-9) ; odds ratio [OR], 4.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.66-7.05). rs11655081 was also associated with WD (P = 2.78 × 10(-2) ) but not with any other focal or segmental dystonia. The allele frequency of rs11655081 varies substantially between different populations. The population stratification in our sample was modest (λ = 1.07), but the effect size may be overestimated. Using a small but homogenous patient sample, we provide data for a possible association of ARSG with MD. The variant may also contribute to the risk of WD, a form of dystonia that is often found in relatives of MD patients.	
24386095	A genome wide association study identifies common variants associated with lipid levels in the Chinese population.	Plasma lipid levels are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease and are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several lipid-associated loci, but these loci have been identified primarily in European populations. In order to identify genetic markers for lipid levels in a Chinese population and analyze the heterogeneity between Europeans and Asians, especially Chinese, we performed a meta-analysis of two genome wide association studies on four common lipid traits including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in a Han Chinese population totaling 3,451 healthy subjects. Replication was performed in an additional 8,830 subjects of Han Chinese ethnicity. We replicated eight loci associated with lipid levels previously reported in a European population. The loci genome wide significantly associated with TC were near DOCK7, HMGCR and ABO; those genome wide significantly associated with TG were near APOA1/C3/A4/A5 and LPL; those genome wide significantly associated with LDL were near HMGCR, ABO and TOMM40; and those genome wide significantly associated with HDL were near LPL, LIPC and CETP. In addition, an additive genotype score of eight SNPs representing the eight loci that were found to be associated with lipid levels was associated with higher TC, TG and LDL levels (P = 5.52 × 10(-16), 1.38 × 10(-6) and 5.59 × 10(-9), respectively). These findings suggest the cumulative effects of multiple genetic loci on plasma lipid levels. Comparisons with previous GWAS of lipids highlight heterogeneity in allele frequency and in effect size for some loci between Chinese and European populations. The results from our GWAS provided comprehensive and convincing evidence of the genetic determinants of plasma lipid levels in a Chinese population.	 20634204 20616382 21353261 22110658 22171074 22531126 12958120 1464741 15297300 16862161 17572673 17620530 17701901 18193043 18193044 18354102 19060906 19060911 19936222 20139978 20233392 20686565 20864672

24166409	Genome-wide association study of alcohol dependence:significant findings in African- and European-Americans including novel risk loci.	We report a GWAS of alcohol dependence (AD) in European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) populations, with replication in independent samples of EAs, AAs and Germans. Our sample for discovery and replication was 16 087 subjects, the largest sample for AD GWAS to date. Numerous genome-wide significant (GWS) associations were identified, many novel. Most associations were population specific, but in several cases were GWS in EAs and AAs for different SNPs at the same locus,showing biological convergence across populations. We confirmed well-known risk loci mapped to alcohol-metabolizing enzyme genes, notably ADH1B (EAs: Arg48His, P=1.17 × 10(-31); AAs: Arg369Cys, P=6.33 × 10(-17)) and ADH1C in AAs (Thr151Thr, P=4.94 × 10(-10)), and identified novel risk loci mapping to the ADH gene cluster on chromosome 4 and extending centromerically beyond it to include GWS associations at LOC100507053 in AAs (P=2.63 × 10(-11)), PDLIM5 in EAs (P=2.01 × 10(-8)), and METAP in AAs (P=3.35 × 10(-8)). We also identified a novel GWS association (1.17 × 10(-10)) mapped to chromosome 2 at rs1437396, between MTIF2 and CCDC88A, across all of the EA and AA cohorts, with supportive gene expression evidence, and population-specific GWS for markers on chromosomes 5, 9 and 19. Several of the novel associations implicate direct involvement of, or interaction with, genes previously identified as schizophrenia risk loci. Confirmation of known AD risk loci supports the overall validity of the study; the novel loci are worthy of genetic and biological follow-up. The findings support a convergence of risk genes (but not necessarily risk alleles) between populations, and, to a lesser extent, between psychiatric traits. 	 24143882 23958962 3719049 1973210 1871133 16220108 15896927 16213469 16571603 16862161 17360578 17194218 18021463 18264090 18385739 18707678 19581569 19533172 19778506 19778507 20202923 20468071 20616382 21471458 21497796 22004471 22302827 22385968 21968928 22102315 22476623 23455491 23456092 23704821 23089632 23732877 23855403

24387989	Immunochip analysis identifies multiple susceptibility loci for systemic sclerosis.	In this study, 1,833 systemic sclerosis (SSc) cases and 3,466 controls were genotyped with the Immunochip array. Classical alleles, amino acid residues, and SNPs across the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region were imputed and tested. These analyses resulted in a model composed of six polymorphic amino acid positions and seven SNPs that explained the observed significant associations in the region. In addition, a replication step comprising 4,017 SSc cases and 5,935 controls was carried out for several selected non-HLA variants, reaching a total of 5,850 cases and 9,401 controls of European ancestry. Following this strategy, we identified and validated three SSc risk loci, including DNASE1L3 at 3p14, the SCHIP1-IL12A locus at 3q25, and ATG5 at 6q21, as well as a suggested association of the TREH-DDX6 locus at 11q23. The associations of several previously reported SSc risk loci were validated and further refined, and the observed peak of association in PXK was related to DNASE1L3. Our study has increased the number of known genetic associations with SSc, provided further insight into the pleiotropic effects of shared autoimmune risk factors, and highlighted the power of dense mapping for detecting previously overlooked susceptibility loci. 	 23315928 23372721 23229555 23311619 23293030 22896740 23459209 23498937 23656658 11141064 11128673 11303306 15264254 7378088 3361530 1946428 8316295 9714828 15629432 15817706 16084222 16415888 16998491 17701901 17924348 18221988 18852200 19116937 19143809 19286670 19479858 19543373 19605749 19559017 19644887 19838195 19898481 19950257 19933168 20356827 23603761 23603763 23762245 23727859 23749187 23624108 23740937 24013639 23830517 19596691 20383147 20231204 20702402 20981092 21750679 21779181 21345260 22019780 22057235 22120051 22076442 22362761 22407130 22218928 22440820 22955989 22961000 23026857 23041452 22922229 22936693 23143594 23143596
24392092	BAIAP2 is related to emotional modulation of human memory strength.	Memory performance is the result of many distinct mental processes, such as memory encoding, forgetting, and modulation of memory strength by emotional arousal. These processes, which are subserved by partly distinct molecular profiles, are not always amenable to direct observation. Therefore, computational models can be used to make inferences about specific mental processes and to study their genetic underpinnings. Here we combined a computational model-based analysis of memory-related processes with high density genetic information derived from a genome-wide study in healthy young adults. After identifying the best-fitting model for a verbal memory task and estimating the best-fitting individual cognitive parameters, we found a common variant in the gene encoding the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (BAIAP2) that was related to the model parameter reflecting modulation of verbal memory strength by negative valence. We also observed an association between the same genetic variant and a similar emotional modulation phenotype in a different population performing a picture memory task. Furthermore, using functional neuroimaging we found robust genotype-dependent differences in activity of the parahippocampal cortex that were specifically related to successful memory encoding of negative versus neutral information. Finally, we analyzed cortical gene expression data of 193 deceased subjects and detected significant BAIAP2 genotype-dependent differences in BAIAP2 mRNA levels.

24399259	Two new susceptibility loci 1q24.2 and 11p11.2 confer risk to severe acne.	Severe acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by widespread inflammatory lesions including nodules, cysts and potential scarring. Here we perform the first genome-wide association study of severe acne in a Chinese Han population comprising 1,056 cases and 1,056 controls using the Illumina HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip. In an independent cohort of 1,860 cases and 3,660 controls of Chinese Han, we replicate 101 SNPs of which 3 showed consistent association. We identify two new susceptibility loci at 11p11.2 (DDB2, rs747650, P(combined)=4.41 × 10⁻⁹ and rs1060573, P(combined)=1.28 × 10⁻⁸) and 1q24.2 (SELL, rs7531806, P(combined)=1.20 × 10⁻⁸) that are involved in androgen metabolism, inflammation processes and scar formation in severe acne. These results point to new genetic susceptibility factors and suggest several new biological pathways related to severe acne.	
24403052	Germline sequence variants in TGM3 and RGS22 confer risk of basal cell carcinoma.	To search for new sequence variants that confer risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC), we conducted a genome-wide association study of 38.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels identified through whole-genome sequencing of 2230 Icelanders. We imputed genotypes for 4208 BCC patients and 109 408 controls using Illumina SNP chip typing data, carried out association tests and replicated the findings in independent population samples. We found new BCC susceptibility loci at TGM3 (rs214782[G], P = 5.5 × 10(-17), OR = 1.29) and RGS22 (rs7006527[C], P = 8.7 × 10(-13), OR = 0.77). TGM3 encodes transglutaminase type 3, which plays a key role in production of the cornified envelope during epidermal differentiation. 	 22496784 22064851 22955989 22955616 23792051 11901200 12111919 12524541 15105499 15213707 9448282 16172037 16527478 17012270 17786808 18159904 18067130 18344981 18488027 18813320 18849993 18703424 19118017 18719606 19165921 19151717 19142970 19136944 19578363 20016592 20716179 20601102 20871598 21378987 21526222 21533872 21700618 21946351 22391625
24430505	Genetic determinants of heel bone properties: genome-wide association meta-analysis and replication in the GEFOS/GENOMOS consortium.	Quantitative ultrasound of the heel captures heel bone properties that independently predict fracture risk and, with bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by X-ray (DXA), may be convenient alternatives for evaluating osteoporosis and fracture risk. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) studies to assess the genetic determinants of heel broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA; n = 14 260), velocity of sound (VOS; n = 15 514) and BMD (n = 4566) in 13 discovery cohorts. Independent replication involved seven cohorts with GWA data (in silico n = 11 452) and new genotyping in 15 cohorts (de novo n = 24 902). In combined random effects, meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts, nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)) associations with heel bone properties. Alongside SNPs within or near previously identified osteoporosis susceptibility genes including ESR1 (6q25.1: rs4869739, rs3020331, rs2982552), SPTBN1 (2p16.2: rs11898505), RSPO3 (6q22.33: rs7741021), WNT16 (7q31.31: rs2908007), DKK1 (10q21.1: rs7902708) and GPATCH1 (19q13.11: rs10416265), we identified a new locus on chromosome 11q14.2 (rs597319 close to TMEM135, a gene recently linked to osteoblastogenesis and longevity) significantly associated with both BUA and VOS (P < 8.23 × 10(-14)). In meta-analyses involving 25 cohorts with up to 14 985 fracture cases, six of 10 SNPs associated with heel bone properties at P < 5 × 10(-6) also had the expected direction of association with any fracture (P < 0.05), including three SNPs with P < 0.005: 6q22.33 (rs7741021), 7q31.31 (rs2908007) and 10q21.1 (rs7902708). In conclusion, this GWA study reveals the effect of several genes common to central DXA-derived BMD and heel ultrasound/DXA measures and points to a new genetic locus with potential implications for better understanding of osteoporosis pathophysiology. 	 16753018 17273893 17498616 17613296 17903295 18442758 18445777 18637193 19333681 18810303 19427923 19801982 20101412 20621892 20616382 20200953 20431112 21151927 21428146 21252233 21533022 22037972 22363428 22504420 22792071 22955616 23437003 23393168 19079262 12172548 12378368 12929931 15068502 3802833 8992884 9080917 9284757 9718201 10383463 15599495 16157825 16193237 16541205
24529757	Genome-wide association study combining pathway analysis for typical sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Chinese Han populations.	Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive motor neuron death. Although the etiology of sALS remains unknown, genetic variants are thought to predispose individuals to the disease. Several recent genome-wide association studies have identified a number of loci that increase sALS susceptibility, but these only explain a small proportion of the disease. To extend the current genetic evidence and to identify novel candidates of sALS, we performed a pooling genome-wide association study by 859,311 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IlluminaHumanOmniZhongHua-8 combining pathway analysis in 250 typical sALS cases precluding age, clinical course, and phenotype interference and 250 control subjects from Chinese Han populations (CHP). The results revealed that 8 novel loci of 1p34.3, 3p21.1, 3p22.2, 10p15.2, 22q12.1, 3q13.11, 11q25, 12q24.33, and 5 previously reported loci of CNTN4 (kgp11325216), ATXN1 (kgp8327591), C9orf72 (kgp6016770), ITPR2 (kgp3041552), and SOD1 (kgp10760302) were associated with sALS from CHP. Furthermore, the pathway analysis based on the Gene Set Analysis Toolkit V2 showed that 10 top pathways were strongly associated with sALS from CHP, and among them, the 7 most potentially candidate pathways were phosphatidylinositol signaling system, Wnt signaling pathway, axon guidance, MAPK signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, and T-cell receptor signaling pathway, a total of 39 significantly associate genes in 7 candidate pathways was suggested to involve in the pathogenesis of sALS from CHP. In conclusion, our results revealed several new loci and pathways related to sALS from CHP and extend the association evidence for partial loci, genes, and pathways, which were previously identified in other populations. Thus, our data provided new clues for exploring the pathogenesis of sALS. 	
24478790	Genome wide association and linkage analyses identified three loci-4q25, 17q23.2, and 10q11.21-associated with variation in leukocyte telomere length: the Long Life Family Study.	Leukocyte telomere length is believed to measure cellular aging in humans, and short leukocyte telomere length is associated with increased risks of late onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, etc. Many studies have shown that leukocyte telomere length is a heritable trait, and several candidate genes have been identified, including TERT, TERC, OBFC1, and CTC1. Unlike most studies that have focused on genetic causes of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes in relation to leukocyte telomere length, the present study examined the genome to identify variants that may contribute to variation in leukocyte telomere length among families with exceptional longevity. From the genome wide association analysis in 4,289 LLFS participants, we identified a novel intergenic SNP rs7680468 located near PAPSS1 and DKK2 on 4q25 (p = 4.7E-8). From our linkage analysis, we identified two additional novel loci with HLOD scores exceeding three, including 4.77 for 17q23.2, and 4.36 for 10q11.21. These two loci harbor a number of novel candidate genes with SNPs, and our gene-wise association analysis identified multiple genes, including DCAF7, POLG2, CEP95, and SMURF2 at 17q23.2; and RASGEF1A, HNRNPF, ANF487, CSTF2T, and PRKG1 at 10q11.21. Among these genes, multiple SNPs were associated with leukocyte telomere length, but the strongest association was observed with one contiguous haplotype in CEP95 and SMURF2. We also show that three previously reported genes-TERC, MYNN, and OBFC1-were significantly associated with leukocyte telomere length at p empirical < 0.05. 	 16611701 15520935 19349587 11280022 17194218 9326339 20139977 16862161 21447597 16463022 12573379 19680556 11880506 23375186 11524377 22825311 16708071 16385451 6651220 12931049 22965356 23280576 19359265 11055372 15214008 10417295 23302541 23321625 11037320 15574496 23419715 19910380 21824912 9519758 19255359 21258136 23133583 20707712 12855277 11731797 9545414 22136229 23001564 16400618 21418511 10326548 10838692 15054401 16997848 17895443 21600224 21737059 17701901 20439422 20421499 22231558 21934123 9631006 11335017 19428446 17150149 9433607 11526246 22499766 12000852
24465431	Familial young-onset diabetes, pre-diabetes and cardiovascular disease are associated with genetic variants of DACH1 in Chinese.	In Asia, young-onset type 2 diabetes (YOD) is characterized by obesity and increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 99 Chinese obese subjects with familial YOD diagnosed before 40-year-old and 101 controls, the T allele of rs1408888 in intron 1 of DACH1(Dachshund homolog 1) was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.49(95% confidence intervals:1.57-3.96, P = 8.4 × 10(-5)). Amongst these subjects, we found reduced expression of DACH1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 63 cases compared to 65 controls (P = 0.02). In a random cohort of 1468 cases and 1485 controls, amongst top 19 SNPs from GWAS, rs1408888 was associated with type 2 diabetes with a global P value of 0.0176 and confirmation in a multiethnic Asian case-control cohort (7370/7802) with an OR of 1.07(1.02-1.12, P(meta)  = 0.012). In 599 Chinese non-diabetic subjects, rs1408888 was linearly associated with systolic blood pressure and insulin resistance. In a case-control cohort (n = 953/953), rs1408888 was associated with an OR of 1.54(1.07-2.22, P = 0.019) for CVD in type 2 diabetes. In an autopsy series of 173 non-diabetic cases, TT genotype of rs1408888 was associated with an OR of 3.31(1.19-9.19, P = 0.0214) and 3.27(1.25-11.07, P = 0.0184) for coronary heart disease (CHD) and coronary arteriosclerosis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that rs1408888 lies within regulatory elements of DACH1 implicated in islet development and insulin secretion. The T allele of rs1408888 of DACH1 was associated with YOD, prediabetes and CVD in Chinese.	 19470990 20351289 17463246 11315092 19082990 19902174 20862305 11575290 17463249 21654912 19823195 12499305 20923499 20869363 17086198 15983262 17167477 11315828 17088339 23532257 21366474 18037333 18469204 18251004 12789325 22158537 14525983 16443891 19896866 19892838 11238885 15630479 20383146 14563999 19997558 15448100 17038197 17182846 15504980 22961080 15983333 21142536 19337543 22308399 16021651 19218599
24448986	Genome-wide association study identifies a new SMAD7 risk variant associated with colorectal cancer risk in East Asians.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been conducted primarily in European descendants. In a GWAS conducted in East Asians, we first analyzed approximately 1.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four studies with 1,773 CRC cases and 2,642 controls. We then selected 66 promising SNPs for replication and genotyped them in three independent studies with 3,612 cases and 3,523 controls. Five SNPs were further evaluated using data from four additional studies including up to 3,290 cases and 4,339 controls. SNP rs7229639 in the SMAD7 gene was found to be associated with CRC risk with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with the minor allele (A) of 1.22 (1.15-1.29) in the combined analysis of all 11 studies (p = 2.93 × 10(-11) ). SNP rs7229639 is 2,487 bp upstream from rs4939827, a risk variant identified previously in a European-ancestry GWAS in relation to CRC risk. However, these two SNPs are not correlated in East Asians (r(2)  = 0.008) nor in Europeans (r(2)  = 0.146). The CRC association with rs7229639 remained statistically significant after adjusting for rs4939827 as well as three additional CRC risk variants (rs58920878, rs12953717 and rs4464148) reported previously in this region. SNPs rs7229639 and rs4939827 explained approximately 1% of the familial relative risk of CRC in East Asians. This study identifies a new CRC risk variant in the SMAD7 gene, further highlighting the significant role of this gene in the etiology of CRC.	 23104301 23263487 23535825 10793168 16310402 23946381 10891514 11693338 12111919 15510158 9382404 10389752 15297300 15922743 16862161 17618283 17618284 17701901 17934461 18084292 18372901 18372905 19011631 19219042 19395656 20018966 20512145 20616382 20634204 20887962 20972440 21058334 21254217 21269274 21296855 21526158 21242260 22580541 22634755 22879968 23266556
24465473	A genome-wide association study identifies a locus on TERT for mean telomere length in Han Chinese.	Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a predictor of aging and a number of age-related diseases. We performed genome-wide association studies of mean LTL in 2632 individuals,with a two-stage replication in 3917 individuals from Chinese populations. To further validate our findings, we get the results of 696 samples from a cohort of European ancestry. We identified two loci associated with LTL that map in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT; rs2736100, P = 1.93×10(-5)) on chromosome 5p15.33 and near keratin 80 (KRT80; rs17653722, P = 6.96×10(-6)) on 12q13.13. In Chinese population each C allele of rs2736100 and T allele of rs17653722 was associated with a longer mean telomere length of 0.026 and 0.059 T/S, respectively, equivalent to about 3 and 7 years of average age-related telomere attrition. Our findings provide new insights into telomere regulatory mechanism and even pathogenesis of age-related diseases.	 15520935 17194218 20139977 16862161 21573004 12928346 12493553 16756500 17200948 22319045 15208457 17289997 22965356 18766326 19285750 21304559 15297300 23535731 22136229 23001564 18452563 11092534 16400618 23908149 19915151 23535734 22086447 17701901 18776909 21725308 17024208 23653681 23555636 20421499 17623782 17873874 21507503 21460395

24342994	Molecular genetic evidence for overlap between general cognitive ability and risk for schizophrenia: a report from the Cognitive Genomics consorTium (COGENT).	It has long been recognized that generalized deficits in cognitive ability represent a core component of schizophrenia (SCZ), evident before full illness onset and independent of medication. The possibility of genetic overlap between risk for SCZ and cognitive phenotypes has been suggested by the presence of cognitive deficits in first-degree relatives of patients with SCZ; however, until recently, molecular genetic approaches to test this overlap have been lacking. Within the last few years, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SCZ have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of the heritability of the disorder is explained by a polygenic component consisting of many common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of extremely small effect. Similar results have been reported in GWAS of general cognitive ability. The primary aim of the present study is to provide the first molecular genetic test of the classic endophenotype hypothesis, which states that alleles associated with reduced cognitive ability should also serve to increase risk for SCZ. We tested the endophenotype hypothesis by applying polygenic SNP scores derived from a large-scale cognitive GWAS meta-analysis (~5000 individuals from nine nonclinical cohorts comprising the Cognitive Genomics consorTium (COGENT)) to four SCZ case-control cohorts. As predicted, cases had significantly lower cognitive polygenic scores compared to controls. In parallel, polygenic risk scores for SCZ were associated with lower general cognitive ability. In addition, using our large cognitive meta-analytic data set, we identified nominally significant cognitive associations for several SNPs that have previously been robustly associated with SCZ susceptibility. Results provide molecular confirmation of the genetic overlap between SCZ and general cognitive ability, and may provide additional insight into pathophysiology of the disorder. 	 19571809 23974872 22384356 23194477 20562875 20300465 21890495 22344220 21799211 20819984 22138821 17434869 23358156 17034022 23375658 21647148 12668349 20881960 21998595 11252993 22820512 23410598 20145623 23419543 23027411 21285140 21926974 20832056 17767157 18198266 21557953 23954163 21826061 21816658 21112188 19294424 18472089 17701901 22856365 23501967 21407268 22566578 21811411 22253779 19571811 23325106 9354147 22722752
24507774	Association of low-frequency and rare coding-sequence variants with blood lipids and coronary heart disease in 56,000 whites and blacks.	Low-frequency coding DNA sequence variants in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9) lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), protect against risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), and have prompted the development of a new class of therapeutics. It is uncertain whether the PCSK9 example represents a paradigm or an isolated exception. We used the "Exome Array" to genotype >200,000 low-frequency and rare coding sequence variants across the genome in 56,538 individuals (42,208 European ancestry [EA] and 14,330 African ancestry [AA]) and tested these variants for association with LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Although we did not identify new genes associated with LDL-C, we did identify four low-frequency (frequencies between 0.1% and 2%) variants (ANGPTL8 rs145464906 [c.361C>T; p.Gln121*], PAFAH1B2 rs186808413 [c.482C>T; p.Ser161Leu], COL18A1 rs114139997 [c.331G>A; p.Gly111Arg], and PCSK7 rs142953140 [c.1511G>A; p.Arg504His]) with large effects on HDL-C and/or triglycerides. None of these four variants was associated with risk for CHD, suggesting that examples of low-frequency coding variants with robust effects on both lipids and CHD will be limited.	 12730697 23843252 2297909 7968073 8985254 9218411 9645224 15654334 16152135 16214597 16554528 16913836 18691683 20031568 20686565 21085708 21149283 21737059 22435370 22641211 22607825 22843986 23150577 23415864 23661745 23623304 23874508 4337382
24493630	A genome-wide association study of early-onset breast cancer identifies PFKM as a novel breast cancer gene and supports a common genetic spectrum for breast cancer at any age.	Early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) causes substantial loss of life and productivity, creating a major burden among women worldwide. We analyzed 1,265,548 Hapmap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among a discovery set of 3,523 EOBC incident cases and 2,702 population control women ages ≤ 51 years. The SNPs with smallest P values were examined in a replication set of 3,470 EOBC cases and 5,475 control women. We also tested EOBC association with 19,684 genes by annotating each gene with putative functional SNPs, and then combining their P values to obtain a gene-based P value. We examined the gene with smallest P value for replication in 1,145 breast cancer cases and 1,142 control women. The combined discovery and replication sets identified 72 new SNPs associated with EOBC (P < 4 × 10(-8)) located in six genomic regions previously reported to contain SNPs associated largely with later-onset breast cancer (LOBC). SNP rs2229882 and 10 other SNPs on chromosome 5q11.2 remained associated (P < 6 × 10(-4)) after adjustment for the strongest published SNPs in the region. Thirty-two of the 82 currently known LOBC SNPs were associated with EOBC (P < 0.05). Low power is likely responsible for the remaining 50 unassociated known LOBC SNPs. The gene-based analysis identified an association between breast cancer and the phosphofructokinase-muscle (PFKM) gene on chromosome 12q13.11 that met the genome-wide gene-based threshold of 2.5 × 10(-6). In conclusion, EOBC and LOBC seem to have similar genetic etiologies; the 5q11.2 region may contain multiple distinct breast cancer loci; and the PFKM gene region is worthy of further investigation. These findings should enhance our understanding of the etiology of breast cancer.	 20872241 19219042 21573193 18326623 20013942 11315092 14339001 21263130 20369019 16862161 19330027 19696889 21124851 18438407 17982118 17529967 22976474 21060860 11065005 21908515 20483646 7479776 17326099 11705483 19330030 17529974 18439551 16492929 17529973 20585626 15217505 18280327 12644538 20699374 20554749 18845558 23535731 20364400 16155052 19536173 20233392 23535733 20332101 18483326 17554300 21062454 20453838 19223389 17701901 10870547 18990759 18469002 7932824 20664043 21980244 15535844 20661439 23535729 9042908 22923054 19933162 16849685 21209837 21357381 12206514
24503447	Genome-wide association study to characterize serum bilirubin elevations in patients with HCV treated with GS-9256, an HCV NS3 serine protease inhibitor.	Protease inhibitors for the treatment of HCV can cause mild and reversible elevations of unconjugated bilirubin. We sought to characterize genetic determinants of bilirubin elevations using a genome-wide approach among patients with genotype 1 HCV who received combination therapy that included GS-9256, a novel potent inhibitor of HCV NS3 serine protease, as part of a Phase IIb trial.	
24516586	Evidence of gene-environment interaction for two genes on chromosome 4 and environmental tobacco smoke in controlling the risk of nonsyndromic cleft palate.	Nonsyndromic cleft palate (CP) is one of the most common human birth defects and both genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to its etiology. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 550 CP case-parent trios ascertained in an international consortium. Stratified analysis among trios with different ancestries was performed to test for GxE interactions with common maternal exposures using conditional logistic regression models. While no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) achieved genome-wide significance when considered alone, markers in SLC2A9 and the neighboring WDR1 on chromosome 4p16.1 gave suggestive evidence of gene-environment interaction with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) among 259 Asian trios when the models included a term for GxE interaction. Multiple SNPs in these two genes were associated with increased risk of nonsyndromic CP if the mother was exposed to ETS during the peri-conceptual period (3 months prior to conception through the first trimester). When maternal ETS was considered, fifteen of 135 SNPs mapping to SLC2A9 and 9 of 59 SNPs in WDR1 gave P values approaching genome-wide significance (10(-6)<P<10(-4)) in a test for GxETS interaction. SNPs rs3733585 and rs12508991 in SLC2A9 yielded P = 2.26×10(-7) in a test for GxETS interaction. SNPs rs6820756 and rs7699512 in WDR1 also yielded P = 1.79×10(-7) and P = 1.98×10(-7) in a 1 df test for GxE interaction. Although further replication studies are critical to confirming these findings, these results illustrate how genetic associations for nonsyndromic CP can be missed if potential GxE interaction is not taken into account, and this study suggest SLC2A9 and WDR1 should be considered as candidate genes for CP. 	 11754469 9415696 15022205 15112010 15514239 8447318 9450872 9988882 10364536 15297300 15643916 15824543 17160896 17202867 18327256 18327257 18494608 18698632 18759275 18932005 18834626 19270707 19401770 19503597 19543373 19656524 19779022 20023658 19891592 19914800 19937600 20087401 20436469 20718045 20652317 20884846 21331089 21294900 21423016 21618603 22012839 22241686 22393348 22863734 22150644 7702037 12325076

24509480	Genome-wide trans-ancestry meta-analysis provides insight into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes susceptibility.	To further understanding of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility, we aggregated published meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including 26,488 cases and 83,964 controls of European, east Asian, south Asian and Mexican and Mexican American ancestry. We observed a significant excess in the directional consistency of T2D risk alleles across ancestry groups, even at SNPs demonstrating only weak evidence of association. By following up the strongest signals of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, we identified seven new T2D susceptibility loci. Furthermore, we observed considerable improvements in the fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals at several T2D susceptibility loci. These observations highlight the benefits of trans-ethnic GWAS for the discovery and characterization of complex trait loci and emphasize an exciting opportunity to extend insight into the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of human diseases across populations of diverse ancestry. 	 11315092 20085711 17786212 17943122 18310307 18372903 18852204 19542200 20081858 20126254 20174558 20007922 20395969 20418489 20581827 20686565 20811451 20862305 20865176 20818381 20935629 20935630 20981092 21573907 21874001 21980299 22125221 22158537 22238593 22325160 22212296 22426310 22387028 22446960 22876189 22885922 22885924 22955616 23022100 23089364 23128226 23104008 22961080 23263488 23209189 23328127 23406875 23979933 20011104 20016592 12824425
24511991	Identification of a novel Parkinson's disease locus via stratified genome-wide association study.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex and heterogeneous. The numerous susceptibility loci that have been identified reaffirm the complexity of PD but do not fully explain it; e.g., it is not known if any given PD susceptibility gene is associated with all PD or a disease subtype. We also suspect that important disease genes may have escaped detection because of this heterogeneity. We used presence/absence of family history to subdivide the cases and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Sporadic-PD and Familial-PD separately. The aim was to uncover new genes and gain insight into the genetic architecture of PD.	 20485568 19915576 20711177 20634204 21060011 20947659 21081151 21106759 21526222 21546914 21738487 21763482 21833088 21876681 21887711 22031444 22344443 22451204 22862947 22941192 24183452 23032990 11912118 12446870 12446736 14593171 15087508 1510387 9197268 9361293 9560156 15541308 15541309 15297300 16132122 16344560 16964263 17020475 17384015 17982457 18210157 18539534 19222302 19543373 19590691 19644074 19915575 20351726
24518671	A genome-wide association study of intra-ocular pressure suggests a novel association in the gene FAM125B in the TwinsUK cohort.	Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness in the world. To date, common genetic variants associated with glaucoma only explain a small proportion of its heritability. We performed a genome-wide association study of intra-ocular pressure (IOP), an underlying endophenotype for glaucoma. The discovery phase of the study was carried out in the TwinsUK cohort (N = 2774) analyzing association between IOP and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) imputed to HapMap2. The results were validated in 12 independent replication cohorts of European ancestry (combined N = 22 789) that were a part of the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of the significantly associated SNPs were performed using data from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) Study. In the TwinsUK cohort, IOP was significantly associated with a number of SNPs at 9q33.3 (P = 3.48 × 10(-8) for rs2286885, the most significantly associated SNP at this locus), within the genomic sequence of the FAM125B gene. Independent replication in a composite panel of 12 cohorts revealed consistent direction of effect and significant association (P = 0.003, for fixed-effect meta-analysis). Suggestive evidence for an eQTL effect of rs2286885 was observed for one of the probes targeting the coding region of the FAM125B gene. This gene codes for a component of a membrane complex involved in vesicular trafficking process, a function similar to that of the Caveolin genes (CAV1 and CAV2) which have previously been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma. This study suggests a novel association between SNPs in FAM125B and IOP in the TwinsUK cohort, though further studies to elucidate the functional role of this gene in glaucoma are necessary.	 11731797 12365904 10163329 9627643 16689637 17397925 17652737 18653607 18310059 18502994 19541915 19639606 19996148 20548946 20237253 20150923 20835238 21075103 21304890 21532571 22133988 22570617 22570627 22941192 23028770 23088889 23900606 23836780

24514567	A genome-wide association study of anorexia nervosa.	Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and heritable eating disorder characterized by dangerously low body weight. Neither candidate gene studies nor an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) have yielded significant and replicated results. We performed a GWAS in 2907 cases with AN from 14 countries (15 sites) and 14 860 ancestrally matched controls as part of the Genetic Consortium for AN (GCAN) and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3). Individual association analyses were conducted in each stratum and meta-analyzed across all 15 discovery data sets. Seventy-six (72 independent) single nucleotide polymorphisms were taken forward for in silico (two data sets) or de novo (13 data sets) replication genotyping in 2677 independent AN cases and 8629 European ancestry controls along with 458 AN cases and 421 controls from Japan. The final global meta-analysis across discovery and replication data sets comprised 5551 AN cases and 21 080 controls. AN subtype analyses (1606 AN restricting; 1445 AN binge-purge) were performed. No findings reached genome-wide significance. Two intronic variants were suggestively associated: rs9839776 (P=3.01 × 10(-7)) in SOX2OT and rs17030795 (P=5.84 × 10(-6)) in PPP3CA. Two additional signals were specific to Europeans: rs1523921 (P=5.76 × 10(-)(6)) between CUL3 and FAM124B and rs1886797 (P=8.05 × 10(-)(6)) near SPATA13. Comparing discovery with replication results, 76% of the effects were in the same direction, an observation highly unlikely to be due to chance (P=4 × 10(-6)), strongly suggesting that true findings exist but our sample, the largest yet reported, was underpowered for their detection. The accrual of large genotyped AN case-control samples should be an immediate priority for the field. 	 12210640 16152574 23974872 8481735 11799475 17497704 23801539 24549058 17384015 21036328 7793446 20054198 23999524 9672050 14566926 16600234 22963884 10703806 23217606 10698815 22911880 21972279 20507892 19828139 14639702 10914105 11867360 16815322 16520436 22797368 20509871 19680270 20935630 21926974 18646037 15609150 20517342 20811451 16134111 7814009 23568457 22472876 22484627 20421936 15852321 20732625 15800149 21079607 11912184 17370291 11232922 10698830 17464678 17430085 15800146 16212836 15569892 21167468 11352375 21727255 18951455 22243964 17370290 23001569 2053633 19543373 17469897 22777127 22706312
24532676	High-density genotyping of immune loci in Koreans and Europeans identifies eight new rheumatoid arthritis risk loci.	A highly polygenic aetiology and high degree of allele-sharing between ancestries have been well elucidated in genetic studies of rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, the high-density genotyping array Immunochip for immune disease loci identified 14 new rheumatoid arthritis risk loci among individuals of European ancestry. Here, we aimed to identify new rheumatoid arthritis risk loci using Korean-specific Immunochip data.	 17701901 17873874 18362944 18840781 19180477 19543373 10643697 19838193 20169177 20190752 20220756 20410501 20510730 20509871 19430480 20702402 20870100 20926424 21058334 21102463 21383967 21399635 21452313 21296190 21833088 22057235 22150039 22064851 22365150 22532805 22446960 22446963 22820512 22941192 22961000 22689384 23001122 23143596 23269371 23273568 23381558 23785302 23917628 24390342
24532677	A genome-wide association study of rheumatoid arthritis without antibodies against citrullinated peptides.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients can be classified based on presence or absence of anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) in their serum. This heterogeneity among patients may reflect important biological differences underlying the disease process. To date, the majority of genetic studies have focused on the ACPA-positive group. Therefore, our goal was to analyse the genetic risk factors that contribute to ACPA-negative RA.	
24556642	Genome-wide association study of primary dentition pit-and-fissure and smooth surface caries.	Dental caries continues to be the most common chronic disease in children today. Despite the substantial involvement of genetics in the process of caries development, the specific genes contributing to dental caries remain largely unknown. We performed separate genome-wide association studies of smooth and pit-and-fissure tooth surface caries experience in the primary dentitions of self-reported white children in two samples from Iowa and rural Appalachia. In total, 1,006 children (ages 3-12 years) were included for smooth surface analysis, and 979 children (ages 4-14 years) for pit-and-fissure surface analysis. Associations were tested for more than 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, either genotyped or imputed. We detected genome-wide significant signals in KPNA4 (p value = 2.0E-9), and suggestive signals in ITGAL (p value = 2.1E-7) and PLUNC family genes (p value = 2.0E-6), thus nominating these novel loci as putative caries susceptibility genes. We also replicated associations observed in previous studies for MPPED2 (p value = 6.9E-6), AJAP1 (p value = 1.6E-6) and RPS6KA2 (p value = 7.3E-6). Replication of these associations in additional samples, as well as experimental studies to determine the biological functions of associated genetic variants, are warranted. Ultimately, efforts such as this may lead to a better understanding of caries etiology, and could eventually facilitate the development of new interventions and preventive measures.	 1303533 18522740 17355248 8297257 9775475 21940522 16246939 22699663 23064960 15935266 16121123 20616382 17684756 19200528 12412952 16762015 23064961 9545414 19897590 20339488 12740537 11971875 10197335 23259602 23470693 10509332 19561590 17267690 21407268 20809862 12538848 3063664 22286298 20516689 22605979 15511295 16711625
24535457	A genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma Aβ peptides concentrations in the elderly.	Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides are the major components of senile plaques, one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, Aβ peptides' functions are not fully understood and seem to be highly pleiotropic. We hypothesized that plasma Aβ peptides concentrations could be a suitable endophenotype for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) designed to (i) identify novel genetic factors involved in amyloid precursor protein metabolism and (ii) highlight relevant Aβ-related physiological and pathophysiological processes. Hence, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of four studies totaling 3 528 healthy individuals of European descent and for whom plasma Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 peptides levels had been quantified. Although we did not observe any genome-wide significant locus, we identified 18 suggestive loci (P<1 × 10(-)(5)). Enrichment-pathway analyses revealed canonical pathways mainly involved in neuronal functions, for example, axonal guidance signaling. We also assessed the biological impact of the gene most strongly associated with plasma Aβ1-42 levels (cortexin 3, CTXN3) on APP metabolism in vitro and found that the gene protein was able to modulate Aβ1-42 secretion. In conclusion, our study results suggest that plasma Aβ peptides levels are valid endophenotypes in GWASs and can be used to characterize the metabolism and functions of APP and its metabolites. 	 11689470 22782894 11160418 17761686 20932310 23703215 20568118 11775062 17786280 11910111 20209079 18401021 19148186 21525986 20031568 22675290 20098734 21371880 22107728 11443731 19204726 8764620 18711365 14559775 11132093 18606478 12832078 21877163 14598854 20616382 2218531 21926974 8600393 23535033 22002080 23562540 16857570 22872014 22150401 21460840 20724036 19734903 15615772 21123754 20233392 15024728 17936506 19752451 9932109 21805181 9564890 20451875 23801940 20460622 18955571 11125143 17701901 15584908 22748936 12065626 22865819 19853035 16406235 15558716 11335065 20828568 15170327 10806097
24839885	A genome-wide association meta-analysis of preschool internalizing problems.	Preschool internalizing problems (INT) are highly heritable and moderately genetically stable from childhood into adulthood. Gene-finding studies are scarce. In this study, the influence of genome-wide measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was investigated in 3 cohorts (total N = 4,596 children) in which INT was assessed with the same instrument, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).	
24554482	Genome-wide association study of peripheral neuropathy with D-drug-containing regimens in AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 384.	Stavudine (d4T) was, until recently, one of the most widely prescribed antiretroviral drugs worldwide. While there has been a major shift away from d4T use in resource-limited countries, a large number of patients have previously received (or continue to receive) d4T, and many have developed peripheral neuropathy. The identification of genetic predictors of increased risk might suggest novel therapeutic targets for such patients. In AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 384, antiretroviral-naïve patients were randomized to d4T/didanosine (ddI)- or zidovudine/lamivudine-containing regimens. Data from d4T/ddI recipients were analyzed for genome-wide associations (approximately 1 million genetic loci) with new onset distal sensory peripheral neuropathy. Analyses involved 254 patients (49 % White, 34 % Black, 17 % Hispanic), comprising 90 peripheral neuropathy cases (32 grade 1, 35 grade 2, 23 grade 3) and 164 controls. After correcting for multiple comparisons, no polymorphism was consistently associated with neuropathy among all patients, among White, Black, and Hispanic patients analyzed separately, both in genome-wide analyses (threshold, P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) and focused on 46 neuropathy-associated genes (threshold, P < 3.5 × 10(-5)). In the latter analyses, the lowest P values were in KIF1A among Whites (rs10199388, P = 8.4 × 10(-4)), in LITAF among Blacks (rs13333308, P = 6.0 × 10(-6)), and in NEFL among Hispanics (rs17763685, P = 5.6 × 10(-6)). Susceptibility to d4T/ddI-associated neuropathy is not explained by a single genetic variant with a marked effect.	 17041604 16790085 17701901 18758688 19119414 20402593 21051598 21820098 22258533 11293802 11406640 12525712 12566280 14668455 16103764 17564959
24586186	Genome-wide association study of metabolic traits reveals novel gene-metabolite-disease links.	Metabolic traits are molecular phenotypes that can drive clinical phenotypes and may predict disease progression. Here, we report results from a metabolome- and genome-wide association study on (1)H-NMR urine metabolic profiles. The study was conducted within an untargeted approach, employing a novel method for compound identification. From our discovery cohort of 835 Caucasian individuals who participated in the CoLaus study, we identified 139 suggestively significant (P<5×10(-8)) and independent associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and metabolome features. Fifty-six of these associations replicated in the TasteSensomics cohort, comprising 601 individuals from São Paulo of vastly diverse ethnic background. They correspond to eleven gene-metabolite associations, six of which had been previously identified in the urine metabolome and three in the serum metabolome. Our key novel findings are the associations of two SNPs with NMR spectral signatures pointing to fucose (rs492602, P = 6.9×10(-44)) and lysine (rs8101881, P = 1.2×10(-33)), respectively. Fine-mapping of the first locus pinpointed the FUT2 gene, which encodes a fucosyltransferase enzyme and has previously been associated with Crohn's disease. This implicates fucose as a potential prognostic disease marker, for which there is already published evidence from a mouse model. The second SNP lies within the SLC7A9 gene, rare mutations of which have been linked to severe kidney damage. The replication of previous associations and our new discoveries demonstrate the potential of untargeted metabolomics GWAS to robustly identify molecular disease markers. 	 21909115 18752343 21665994 10471498 22482804 19043545 21572414 23966204 20570966 22247045 22593726 20369022 15774760 22546284 17572673 22782382 20526369 11352068 22132133 23483888 20935630 21102463 19487333 19430480 20383146 21886157 22068912 18271029 23065485 23160491 19275240 19570852 17435758 21931564 21170321 20037589 23032255 23093944 19812666 17886233 22546737 17701901 23010998 23013615 18419139 17873874 20141220 21363910 22286219 23122585 20214818 20220756 22190364 22626506
24564958	Variability in the common genetic architecture of social-communication spectrum phenotypes during childhood and adolescence.	Social-communication abilities are heritable traits, and their impairments overlap with the autism continuum. To characterise the genetic architecture of social-communication difficulties developmentally and identify genetic links with the autistic dimension, we conducted a genome-wide screen of social-communication problems at multiple time-points during childhood and adolescence.	 12742874 21871371 18193044 16423148 19106766 22507743 21572417 11055457 17363630 16862161 18374305 22341974 21552263 20838614 22507702 19488046 20833646 21438136 19812673 12214309 23375656 19065143 22037497 17572673 22843982 16319410 1301956 7814313 19598235 22843504 12384689 23774735 21078308 9016266 19404256 21058334 18564070 17701901 20634369 22213788 12610651 22065527 24047820 24074471 23358157 20012890 22317971 20531469 22356179
24569950	Genetic influences on political ideologies: twin analyses of 19 measures of political ideologies from five democracies and genome-wide findings from three populations.	Almost 40 years ago, evidence from large studies of adult twins and their relatives suggested that between 30 and 60% of the variance in social and political attitudes could be explained by genetic influences. However, these findings have not been widely accepted or incorporated into the dominant paradigms that explain the etiology of political ideology. This has been attributed in part to measurement and sample limitations, as well the relative absence of molecular genetic studies. Here we present results from original analyses of a combined sample of over 12,000 twins pairs, ascertained from nine different studies conducted in five democracies, sampled over the course of four decades. We provide evidence that genetic factors play a role in the formation of political ideology, regardless of how ideology is measured, the era, or the population sampled. The only exception is a question that explicitly uses the phrase "Left-Right". We then present results from one of the first genome-wide association studies on political ideology using data from three samples: a 1990 Australian sample involving 6,894 individuals from 3,516 families; a 2008 Australian sample of 1,160 related individuals from 635 families and a 2010 Swedish sample involving 3,334 individuals from 2,607 families. No polymorphisms reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. The combined evidence suggests that political ideology constitutes a fundamental aspect of one's genetically informed psychological disposition, but as Fisher proposed long ago, genetic influences on complex traits will be composed of thousands of markers of very small effects and it will require extremely large samples to have enough power in order to identify specific polymorphisms related to complex social traits.	 20369019 16862161 20303062 9145550 2218526 8352724 21890791 21845928 24860199 23236222 22784448 8639148 22400142 18988845 17221311 22784455 10480741 3459179 23095378 22784447 2392892 6683622 2346462 23722424 24808718 22566634 4857324 2078166 21845502 23946557 22400141 5706461 22784454 19168625 23084033 18373189 8192619 19543373 22784453 22904584 22951140 12486697 17254405
24571439	Genome-wide association analyses of child genotype effects and parent-of-origin effects in specific language impairment.	Specific language impairment (SLI) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects linguistic abilities when development is otherwise normal. We report the results of a genome-wide association study of SLI which included parent-of-origin effects and child genotype effects and used 278 families of language-impaired children. The child genotype effects analysis did not identify significant associations. We found genome-wide significant paternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 14q12 (P = 3.74 × 10(-8)) and suggestive maternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 5p13 (P = 1.16 × 10(-7)). A subsequent targeted association of six single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 5 in 313 language-impaired individuals and their mothers from the ALSPAC cohort replicated the maternal effects, albeit in the opposite direction (P = 0.001); as fathers' genotypes were not available in the ALSPAC study, the replication analysis did not include paternal parent-of-origin effects. The paternally-associated SNP on chromosome 14 yields a non-synonymous coding change within the NOP9 gene. This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that has been reported to be significantly dysregulated in individuals with schizophrenia. The region of maternal association on chromosome 5 falls between the PTGER4 and DAB2 genes, in a region previously implicated in autism and ADHD. The top SNP in this association locus is a potential expression QTL of ARHGEF19 (also called WGEF) on chromosome 1. Members of this protein family have been implicated in intellectual disability. In summary, this study implicates parent-of-origin effects in language impairment, and adds an interesting new dimension to the emerging picture of shared genetic etiology across various neurodevelopmental disorders.	 22507743 9529360 14982245 16987877 21085122 20304067 18179893 22738121 22507742 11769267 10866211 15947021 21972136 19503838 8101276 11125110 9308960 9549241 17447842 11791209 16380908 18005161 17925812 9430746 17956976 23060744 21248734 18200594 11452361 11424982 19009045 18987363 19546859 11017088 20354512 19646677 20640915 19388000 17684495 21629298 8801636 10721532 18256687 24024963 20824079 22952857 24439386 21091092 18163388 21651830 12405479 7828787 17427194 17554300 16703115 22102590 20634204 12687500 15297934 15108193 17701901 16205734 14521195 16827920 23190410 17388790 15133743 15133308 18560438 17273975 21181895 15485661 19933162 15884002 23738518 19052029 9758196 12048648
24586183	Identification of novel genetic Loci associated with thyroid peroxidase antibodies and clinical thyroid disease.	Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) are common, affecting 2-5% of the general population. Individuals with positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) have an increased risk of autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), as well as autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease). As the possible causative genes of TPOAbs and AITD remain largely unknown, we performed GWAS meta-analyses in 18,297 individuals for TPOAb-positivity (1769 TPOAb-positives and 16,528 TPOAb-negatives) and in 12,353 individuals for TPOAb serum levels, with replication in 8,990 individuals. Significant associations (P<5×10(-8)) were detected at TPO-rs11675434, ATXN2-rs653178, and BACH2-rs10944479 for TPOAb-positivity, and at TPO-rs11675434, MAGI3-rs1230666, and KALRN-rs2010099 for TPOAb levels. Individual and combined effects (genetic risk scores) of these variants on (subclinical) hypo- and hyperthyroidism, goiter and thyroid cancer were studied. Individuals with a high genetic risk score had, besides an increased risk of TPOAb-positivity (OR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.68-2.81, P = 8.1×10(-8)), a higher risk of increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (OR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.26-1.82, P = 2.9×10(-6)), as well as a decreased risk of goiter (OR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89, P = 6.5×10(-4)). The MAGI3 and BACH2 variants were associated with an increased risk of hyperthyroidism, which was replicated in an independent cohort of patients with Graves' disease (OR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.54, P = 1.2×10(-7) and OR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.12-1.39, P = 6.2×10(-5)). The MAGI3 variant was also associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism (OR: 1.57, 95% CI 1.18-2.10, P = 1.9×10(-3)). This first GWAS meta-analysis for TPOAbs identified five newly associated loci, three of which were also associated with clinical thyroid disease. With these markers we identified a large subgroup in the general population with a substantially increased risk of TPOAbs. The results provide insight into why individuals with thyroid autoimmunity do or do not eventually develop thyroid disease, and these markers may therefore predict which TPOAb-positives are particularly at risk of developing clinical thyroid dysfunction. 	 22267200 16381988 21558126 22115167 11061528 9862675 12919165 14570752 22956554 11071676 20718761 17159887 22996397 22922229 21829393 22956589 10329730 12826640 19726232 10874528 20190752 15030506 23635656 18794853 18506157 22493691 23529038 20858880 9755173 22561518 15531553 10852107 15818711 11836274 9024270 21909110 17900237 20616382 20883148 21981779 18981062 21102463 19557189 19430480 20383146 22806825 18324486 23263486 12107228 18695079 10748157 7641412 12060066 16934002 1916458 15374026 22821943 23408906 22326521 21833088 22139419 18498223 16098474 20447068 17353866 20453842 22529182 23186910 22162477 21511236 598014 22454529 21884821
24578125	Common variants in UMOD associate with urinary uromodulin levels: a meta-analysis.	Uromodulin is expressed exclusively in the thick ascending limb and is the most abundant protein excreted in normal urine. Variants in UMOD, which encodes uromodulin, are associated with renal function, and urinary uromodulin levels may be a biomarker for kidney disease. However, the genetic factors regulating uromodulin excretion are unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of urinary uromodulin levels to identify associated common genetic variants in the general population. We included 10,884 individuals of European descent from three genetic isolates and three urban cohorts. Each study measured uromodulin indexed to creatinine and conducted linear regression analysis of approximately 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms using an additive model. We also tested whether variants in genes expressed in the thick ascending limb associate with uromodulin levels. rs12917707, located near UMOD and previously associated with renal function and CKD, had the strongest association with urinary uromodulin levels (P<0.001). In all cohorts, carriers of a G allele of this variant had higher uromodulin levels than noncarriers did (geometric means 10.24, 14.05, and 17.67 μg/g creatinine for zero, one, or two copies of the G allele). rs12446492 in the adjacent gene PDILT (protein disulfide isomerase-like, testis expressed) also reached genome-wide significance (P<0.001). Regarding genes expressed in the thick ascending limb, variants in KCNJ1, SORL1, and CAB39 associated with urinary uromodulin levels. These data indicate that common variants in the UMOD promoter region may influence urinary uromodulin levels. They also provide insights into uromodulin biology and the association of UMOD variants with renal function. 	 20383146 23887378 20483451 20598278 20472742 12471200 14520616 14569098 14581387 14595018 14871399 14970063 1208363 9545414 15430405 15297300 15827312 16077740 17000946 17384015 17986697 17898038 18366642 18271029 18405348 20616382 20634204 19430482 21082022 21167468 21081491 21436285 21654721 21610494 21737451 21697815 22357757 22479191 22693617 23056504 23034389 23752888 24185693 24097801 19959715 19005207 20385770
24583629	Genome-wide analysis of methotrexate pharmacogenomics in rheumatoid arthritis shows multiple novel risk variants and leads for TYMS regulation.	Methotrexate (MTX) is the drug of first choice for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but is effective only in around 60% of the patients. Identification of genetic markers to predict response is essential for effective treatment within a critical window period of 6 months after diagnosis, but have been hitherto elusive. In this study, we used genome-wide genotype data to identify the potential risk variants associated with MTX (poor)response in a north Indian RA cohort.	
24578207	Genome-wide genotyping demonstrates a polygenic risk score associated with white matter hyperintensity volume in CADASIL.	White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI are a quantitative marker for sporadic cerebral small vessel disease and are highly heritable. To date, large-scale genetic studies have identified only a single locus influencing WMH burden. This might in part relate to biological heterogeneity of sporadic WMH. The current study searched for genetic modifiers of WMH volume in cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a monogenic small vessel disease.	
24578379	Genome-wide association study for circulating tissue plasminogen activator levels and functional follow-up implicates endothelial STXBP5 and STX2.	Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease, catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the major enzyme responsible for endogenous fibrinolysis. In some populations, elevated plasma levels of tPA have been associated with myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to identify novel correlates of circulating levels of tPA.	 9193430 9620695 10428308 10523162 16525567 16614319 17003924 17255346 19085655 20231535 19430480 21156930 21163921 22990020 23408959 10938026 11056091 11197396 11776389 11884298 11950714 12873656 9040599 7669086 12891381 14972427 1346771 8100314 8222095

24123702	Common quantitative trait locus downstream of RETN gene identified by genome-wide association study is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Han Chinese: a Mendelian randomization effect.	Plasma resistin level is a potential molecular link between obesity and diabetes. Causal role of resistin, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and genetic variants have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify quantitative trait loci associated with resistin levels and investigated whether these variants were prospectively associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and T2DM in an independent community-based cohort, the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS).

24603532	ABCC5, a gene that influences the anterior chamber depth, is associated with primary angle closure glaucoma.	Anterior chamber depth (ACD) is a key anatomical risk factor for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on ACD to discover novel genes for PACG on a total of 5,308 population-based individuals of Asian descent. Genome-wide significant association was observed at a sequence variant within ABCC5 (rs1401999; per-allele effect size =  -0.045 mm, P = 8.17 × 10(-9)). This locus was associated with an increase in risk of PACG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PACG cases and 18,801 controls (per-allele OR = 1.13 [95% CI: 1.06-1.22], P = 0.00046). The association was strengthened when a sub-group of controls with open angles were included in the analysis (per-allele OR = 1.30, P = 7.45 × 10(-9); 3,458 cases vs. 3,831 controls). Our findings suggest that the increase in PACG risk could in part be mediated by genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions.	 22922875 23150908 23150934 17558408 17521428 17554300 15897250 17229149 16799014 16554528 16488940 23920366 15824227 8859083 11734523 11673287 10893247 10964834 10922206 10840050 10676792 10655196 22885922 22801501 22118998 21984434 22081228 22019778 22001756 21307088 21098505 20869459 19995197 19915572 19323627 18586876 18499582 18474780 18071025 18196258 18172078 17701901 17365815
24618891	Genome-wide association study reveals two new risk loci for bipolar disorder.	Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and highly heritable mental illness and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have robustly identified the first common genetic variants involved in disease aetiology. The data also provide strong evidence for the presence of multiple additional risk loci, each contributing a relatively small effect to BD susceptibility. Large samples are necessary to detect these risk loci. Here we present results from the largest BD GWAS to date by investigating 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 24,025 patients and controls. We detect 56 genome-wide significant SNPs in five chromosomal regions including previously reported risk loci ANK3, ODZ4 and TRANK1, as well as the risk locus ADCY2 (5p15.31) and a region between MIR2113 and POU3F2 (6q16.1). ADCY2 is a key enzyme in cAMP signalling and our finding provides new insights into the biological mechanisms involved in the development of BD. 	
24684796	Heritability and genetic association analysis of cognition in the Diabetes Heart Study.	Cognitive performance is an important component of healthy aging. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with negative outcomes for the brain and cognition, although causal mechanisms have not been definitely determined. Genetic risk factors warrant further consideration in this context. This study examined the heritability of cognitive function as assessed by (1) the Digit Symbol Substitution Task; (2) the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination; (3) the Stroop Task; (4) the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Task; and (5) the Controlled Oral Word Association Task for Phonemic and Semantic Fluency, in the family-based, T2D-enriched, Diabetes Heart Study sample (n = 550 participants from 257 families). The genetic basis of these cognitive measures was further evaluated by association analysis with candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide SNP data. Measures of cognitive function were significantly heritable (hˆ(2) = 0.28-0.62) following adjustment for age, gender, and education. A total of 31 SNPs (from 26 genes/regions) selected to form an a priori set of candidate SNPs showed limited evidence of association with cognitive function when applying conservative metrics of significance. Genome-wide assessment of both noncoding and coding variants revealed suggestive evidence of association for several coding variants including rs139509083 in CNST (p = 4.9 × 10(-9)), rs199968569 in PLAA (p = 4.9 × 10(-9)) and rs138487371 in PCDH8 (p = 3.7 × 10(-8)). The identification of a heritable component to cognitive performance in T2D suggests a role for genetic contributors to cognitive performance even in the presence of metabolic disease and other associated comorbidities and is supported by the identification of genetic association signals in functionally plausible candidates. 	 10599761 17286886 11136232 11916953 12592387 12906858 3611032 8223823 10380929 15590460 15800289 16505506 16567535 16698126 17548344 17903297 18369167 18602445 18460048 18641001 19077115 19543373 19734545 19367585 20125193 19488046 21029061 20306291 20837822 21107309 21130836 21409311 21592758 21258858 21643791 22054870 22504421 22296042 22855693 23280576 23286790 23161441 23768515 23659774 23207651 17044846 17053149 10817752
24625756	Genetic determinants influencing human serum metabolome among African Americans.	Phenotypes proximal to gene action generally reflect larger genetic effect sizes than those that are distant. The human metabolome, a result of multiple cellular and biological processes, are functional intermediate phenotypes proximal to gene action. Here, we present a genome-wide association study of 308 untargeted metabolite levels among African Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Nineteen significant common variant-metabolite associations were identified, including 13 novel loci (p<1.6 × 10(-10)). These loci were associated with 7-50% of the difference in metabolite levels per allele, and the variance explained ranged from 4% to 20%. Fourteen genes were identified within the nineteen loci, and four of them contained non-synonymous substitutions in four enzyme-encoding genes (KLKB1, SIAE, CPS1, and NAT8); the other significant loci consist of eight other enzyme-encoding genes (ACE, GATM, ACY3, ACSM2B, THEM4, ADH4, UGT1A, TREH), a transporter gene (SLC6A13) and a polycystin protein gene (PKD2L1). In addition, four potential disease-associated paths were identified, including two direct longitudinal predictive relationships: NAT8 with N-acetylornithine, N-acetyl-1-methylhistidine and incident chronic kidney disease, and TREH with trehalose and incident diabetes. These results highlight the value of using endophenotypes proximal to gene function to discover new insights into biology and disease pathology.	 19474294 19043545 21572414 9852678 20031568 22003128 17943122 2646917 23031429 8104822 12065209 19414839 22960999 20686565 23239837 12191981 19177348 20383145 14730359 23788672 19458390 19198612 20383146 21886157 20392701 23263486 16680201 20037589 23535967 17554300 23032255 23093944 19812666 17634449 19624122 18593304 14987827 22286219 23378610 16311254 20081858
24656865	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies 1q22 as a susceptibility locus for intracerebral hemorrhage.	Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the stroke subtype with the worst prognosis and has no established acute treatment. ICH is classified as lobar or nonlobar based on the location of ruptured blood vessels within the brain. These different locations also signal different underlying vascular pathologies. Heritability estimates indicate a substantial genetic contribution to risk of ICH in both locations. We report a genome-wide association study of this condition that meta-analyzed data from six studies that enrolled individuals of European ancestry. Case subjects were ascertained by neurologists blinded to genotype data and classified as lobar or nonlobar based on brain computed tomography. ICH-free control subjects were sampled from ambulatory clinics or random digit dialing. Replication of signals identified in the discovery cohort with p < 1 × 10(-6) was pursued in an independent multiethnic sample utilizing both direct and genome-wide genotyping. The discovery phase included a case cohort of 1,545 individuals (664 lobar and 881 nonlobar cases) and a control cohort of 1,481 individuals and identified two susceptibility loci: for lobar ICH, chromosomal region 12q21.1 (rs11179580, odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, p = 7.0 × 10(-8)); and for nonlobar ICH, chromosomal region 1q22 (rs2984613, OR = 1.44, p = 1.6 × 10(-8)). The replication included a case cohort of 1,681 individuals (484 lobar and 1,194 nonlobar cases) and a control cohort of 2,261 individuals and corroborated the association for 1q22 (p = 6.5 × 10(-4); meta-analysis p = 2.2 × 10(-10)) but not for 12q21.1 (p = 0.55; meta-analysis p = 2.6 × 10(-5)). These results demonstrate biological heterogeneity across ICH subtypes and highlight the importance of ascertaining ICH cases accordingly.	 17239805 17404194 18063825 18417962 18586028 18988837 19233729 19427958 19474294 19543373 20220758 19912325 20686565 20616382 20634204 20981092 21060091 21085122 20947843 21061402 20381197 21681796 22306652 22885924 22955989 22955617 22941190 22933587 23175721 10942013 11256947 11988589 14757893 4105427 3551211 2491756 1969567 9120619 10419538 16862161 17094263 16949250 17210891 23203987 23033344 23602162 23559261 23715323 23793025 23733000 24021679
24647736	Multiple nonglycemic genomic loci are newly associated with blood level of glycated hemoglobin in East Asians.	Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. To discover novel loci harboring common variants associated with HbA1c in East Asians, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 genome-wide association studies (GWAS; N = 21,026). We replicated our findings in three additional studies comprising 11,576 individuals of East Asian ancestry. Ten variants showed associations that reached genome-wide significance in the discovery data set, of which nine (four novel variants at TMEM79 [P value = 1.3 × 10(-23)], HBS1L/MYB [8.5 × 10(-15)], MYO9B [9.0 × 10(-12)], and CYBA [1.1 × 10(-8)] as well as five variants at loci that had been previously identified [CDKAL1, G6PC2/ABCB11, GCK, ANK1, and FN3KI]) showed consistent evidence of association in replication data sets. These variants explained 1.76% of the variance in HbA1c. Several of these variants (TMEM79, HBS1L/MYB, CYBA, MYO9B, ANK1, and FN3K) showed no association with either blood glucose or type 2 diabetes. Among individuals with nondiabetic levels of fasting glucose (<7.0 mmol/L) but elevated HbA1c (≥6.5%), 36.1% had HbA1c <6.5% after adjustment for these six variants. Our East Asian GWAS meta-analysis has identified novel variants associated with HbA1c as well as demonstrated that the effects of known variants are largely transferable across ethnic groups. Variants affecting erythrocyte parameters rather than glucose metabolism may be relevant to the use of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes in these populations. 	 11812764 23757434 11975663 22290723 22885922 22861356 23043469 23251491 12949720 7041886 7655856 8907710 10102716 16026268 17463248 17572673 17943122 18361936 18596229 19096518 19200528 19292887 19538307 19561590 19528534 19808799 19820697 19862010 19853236 20042772 20081857 20081858 20139978 20183929 20354512 20303373 20215417 20686565 20616382 20927387 20881960 20849430 20853098 20858683 21515326 21738478 21874001 21909109 22089614 21975967 22139419 22158537 22344219 12189439 23222517 23263863 23354016 23446634 11845227
24651765	Genome-wide meta-analysis of homocysteine and methionine metabolism identifies five one carbon metabolism loci and a novel association of ALDH1L1 with ischemic stroke.	Circulating homocysteine levels (tHcy), a product of the folate one carbon metabolism pathway (FOCM) through the demethylation of methionine, are heritable and are associated with an increased risk of common diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and dementia. The FOCM is the sole source of de novo methyl group synthesis, impacting many biological and epigenetic pathways. However, the genetic determinants of elevated tHcy (hyperhomocysteinemia), dysregulation of methionine metabolism and the underlying biological processes remain unclear. We conducted independent genome-wide association studies and a meta-analysis of methionine metabolism, characterized by post-methionine load test tHcy, in 2,710 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and 2,100 participants from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, and then examined the association of the identified loci with incident stroke in FHS. Five genes in the FOCM pathway (GNMT [p = 1.60 × 10(-63)], CBS [p = 3.15 × 10(-26)], CPS1 [p = 9.10 × 10(-13)], ALDH1L1 [p = 7.3 × 10(-13)] and PSPH [p = 1.17 × 10(-16)]) were strongly associated with the difference between pre- and post-methionine load test tHcy levels (ΔPOST). Of these, one variant in the ALDH1L1 locus, rs2364368, was associated with incident ischemic stroke. Promoter analyses reveal genetic and epigenetic differences that may explain a direct effect on GNMT transcription and a downstream affect on methionine metabolism. Additionally, a genetic-score consisting of the five significant loci explains 13% of the variance of ΔPOST in FHS and 6% of the variance in VISP. Association between variants in FOCM genes with ΔPOST suggest novel mechanisms that lead to differences in methionine metabolism, and possibly the epigenome, impacting disease risk. These data emphasize the importance of a concerted effort to understand regulators of one carbon metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.	 10323741 12801809 12417369 14762035 17190894 23497786 18505952 16479441 16531613 14673469 12083731 20686565 20154341 20616382 742537 16917147 3437026 18805305 18439912 19200528 22187282 10364517 18544171 18421701 7967489 15297300 20811451 2558067 6587377 20645850 14025561 20805753 9509248 19439180 7768022 21308989 1208363 23822983 22941190 24049135 16397184 23041239 23093205 15613145 20031578 7488329 23019048 2011158 20040588 20590502 20926424 23087634 11011846 20458436
24658283	A genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis for tobacco smoke and lung cancer susceptibility.	Tobacco smoke is the major environmental risk factor underlying lung carcinogenesis. However, approximately one-tenth smokers develop lung cancer in their lifetime indicating there is significant individual variation in susceptibility to lung cancer. And, the reasons for this are largely unknown. In particular, the genetic variants discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the phenotypic variations for lung cancer, and gene-environment interactions are thought to explain the missing fraction of disease heritability. The ability to identify smokers at high risk of developing cancer has substantial preventive implications. Thus, we undertook a gene-smoking interaction analysis in a GWAS of lung cancer in Han Chinese population using a two-phase designed case-control study. In the discovery phase, we evaluated all pair-wise (591 370) gene-smoking interactions in 5408 subjects (2331 cases and 3077 controls) using a logistic regression model with covariate adjustment. In the replication phase, promising interactions were validated in an independent population of 3023 subjects (1534 cases and 1489 controls). We identified interactions between two single nucleotide polymorphisms and smoking. The interaction P values are 6.73 × 10(-) (6) and 3.84 × 10(-) (6) for rs1316298 and rs4589502, respectively, in the combined dataset from the two phases. An antagonistic interaction (rs1316298-smoking) and a synergetic interaction (rs4589502-smoking) were observed. The two interactions identified in our study may help explain some of the missing heritability in lung cancer susceptibility and present strong evidence for further study of these gene-smoking interactions, which are benefit to intensive screening and smoking cessation interventions.	 21850685 19733727 17328794 18987709 15578700 18974171 19674832 15231689 16862161 22189957 22901126 16140944 22741015 23842454 18328423 18385676 21965784 18978787 11720740 22190428 22820512 11888908 18957677 17569110 21666719 18978790 21785462 22024018 16962926 20951342 18385738 19551151 22432035 22232600 15297300 15044328 22904681 15318814 21406400 22206016 22306564 21725308 22197220 12856737 19812666 22679562 20634204 22072123 23644744 17701901 18082227 17260018 21558411 22797725 16537812 10833460 21614524 21296855 7017215 22760307 10592771
24665060	Genome-wide association study of smoking behaviours among Bangladeshi adults.	The high prevalence of tobacco use in some developing nations, including Bangladesh, poses several public health challenges for these populations. Smoking behaviour is determined by genetic and environmental factors; however, the genetic determinants of smoking behaviour have not been previously examined in a Bangladeshi or South Asian population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of tobacco smoking behaviour among a population-based sample of 5354 (2035 ever smokers and 3319 never smokers) men and women in Bangladesh.	 20418890 22006218 23049750 19451621 22377092 22345571 16624965 19188921 17893872 17919685 23875064 19628476 22832964 18190672 16160703 14557728 6112456 22534784 18668430 19434213 20418888 23590571 18200594 16632515 20598278 22589738 19268276 18385739 20031315 20085960 16793761 22383894 20634204 20418889 17701901 23505526 11544383 12727770 19247474 19330903 22492648 20208533
24662972	Genome-wide interaction study of smoking and bladder cancer risk.	Bladder cancer is a complex disease with known environmental and genetic risk factors. We performed a genome-wide interaction study (GWAS) of smoking and bladder cancer risk based on primary scan data from 3002 cases and 4411 controls from the National Cancer Institute Bladder Cancer GWAS. Alternative methods were used to evaluate both additive and multiplicative interactions between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and smoking exposure. SNPs with interaction P values < 5 × 10(-) (5) were evaluated further in an independent dataset of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls. We identified 10 SNPs that showed association in a consistent manner with the initial dataset and in the combined dataset, providing evidence of interaction with tobacco use. Further, two of these novel SNPs showed strong evidence of association with bladder cancer in tobacco use subgroups that approached genome-wide significance. Specifically, rs1711973 (FOXF2) on 6p25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for never smokers [combined odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.20-1.50, P value = 5.18 × 10(-) (7)]; and rs12216499 (RSPH3-TAGAP-EZR) on 6q25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for ever smokers (combined OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.67-0.84, P value = 6.35 × 10(-) (7)). In our analysis of smoking and bladder cancer, the tests for multiplicative interaction seemed to more commonly identify susceptibility loci with associations in never smokers, whereas the additive interaction analysis identified more loci with associations among smokers-including the known smoking and NAT2 acetylation interaction. Our findings provide additional evidence of gene-environment interactions for tobacco and bladder cancer. 	 22064851 23536561 22416122 21824976 11227921 11590080 8122051 8757131 9265696 16112301 15997248 24163127 16465622 16439479 16835335 17040106 17510073 18483344 18794855 19151717 19648920 19706757 19684019 19917915 19997042 20972438 21037224 20739907 20675267 21750109 21678399 22955989 22955619 23118105 23143601 23408570 22228101

24680774	Insight into genetic determinants of resting heart rate.	Recent studies suggested that resting heart rate (RHR) might be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.

24677629	A genome-wide association study of clinical symptoms of dissociation in a trauma-exposed sample.	Recent work suggests that a subset of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit marked dissociative symptoms, as defined by derealization and depersonalization. A dissociative subtype of PTSD was added to the diagnostic criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 (DSM-5) to capture this presentation of PTSD. This study examined genetic polymorphisms for association with the symptoms that define the dissociative subtype of PTSD using a genome-wide approach.	 12930761 17974934 16862161 10835412 16281233 23528911 14966477 10864938 22431063 19228812 18468583 23278386 23131898 18252227 11864601 18349090 10066258 23059051 21350482 20549395 23062294 22869035 8955680 21176025 15289280 21780190 10887767 18448650 11382268 20638449 19691954 17169436 20805901 17137559 9744860 12114005 21818827 22639402 22732483 23069673 20360318 22718613 22470424 20685689 10482244 23505265 23726511 19944409 22752235 17701901 18163389 22653764 19500775 7712061 22832970 20965422 9710619 17943026 17608961 20976279 16088328 21943606 16914643 16769663
24676358	IgA measurements in over 12 000 Swedish twins reveal sex differential heritability and regulatory locus near CD30L.	In a broad attempt to improve the understanding of the genetic regulation of serum IgA levels, the heritability was estimated in over 12 000 Swedish twins, and a genome-wide association study was conducted in a subsample of 9617. Using the classical twin model the heritability was found to be significantly larger among females (61%) compared with males (21%), while contribution from shared environment (20%) was only seen for males. By modeling the genetic relationship matrix with IgA levels, we estimate that a substantial proportion (31%) of variance in IgA levels can ultimately be explained by the investigated SNPs. The genome-wide association study revealed significant association to two loci: (i) rs6928791 located on chromosome 6, 22 kb upstream of the gene SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1) and (ii) rs13300483 on chromosome 9, situated 12 kb downstream the CD30 ligand (CD30L) encoding gene. The association to rs13300483 was replicated in two additional independent Swedish materials. The heritability of IgA levels is moderate and can partly be attributable to common variation in the CD30L locus. 	 21937984 20392479 21658139 18180376 21297633 1212818 12537870 23137839 23028341 17261791 10222644 23417110 4938275 11720003 23258944 20700443 23031429 7414242 23128233 22075330 16771849 19541543 18846228 8045565 4421585 23517042 12187400 21850030 635399 24402621 4173142 2035899 20616382 4204534 3251046 20860503 19790058 21102463 4192478 22673310 9412941 4215824 18005364 12270000 1327440 20233392 23563607 1931006 20066028 19880490 22566634 23118916 2583731 22864923 23146381 20031011 17701901 20031576 15025682 21167468 4250615 19543373 9462262
24688116	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of human longevity identifies a novel locus conferring survival beyond 90 years of age.	The genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is ∼ 25%. Despite the large number of identified disease-susceptibility loci, it is not known which loci influence population mortality. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 7729 long-lived individuals of European descent (≥ 85 years) and 16 121 younger controls (<65 years) followed by replication in an additional set of 13 060 long-lived individuals and 61 156 controls. In addition, we performed a subset analysis in cases aged ≥ 90 years. We observed genome-wide significant association with longevity, as reflected by survival to ages beyond 90 years, at a novel locus, rs2149954, on chromosome 5q33.3 (OR = 1.10, P = 1.74 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed association of rs4420638 on chromosome 19q13.32 (OR = 0.72, P = 3.40 × 10(-36)), representing the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. In a prospective meta-analysis (n = 34 103), the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) on chromosome 5q33.3 associates with increased survival (HR = 0.95, P = 0.003). This allele has previously been reported to associate with low blood pressure in middle age. Interestingly, the minor allele (T) associates with decreased cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of blood pressure. We report on the first GWAS-identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 influencing survival in the general European population. The minor allele of this locus associates with low blood pressure in middle age, although the contribution of this allele to survival may be less dependent on blood pressure. Hence, the pleiotropic mechanisms by which this intragenic variation contributes to lifespan regulation have to be elucidated.	 21460840 19196970 19557189 19682117 20081857 20081858 20304771 20502693 20686565 20714348 20634204 20702402 20855876 20921414 20858683 21115528 21070591 21258136 21460841 21378990 21418511 21740922 21824675 21873549 21909110 21909115 22094949 22064851 22279548 22189269 22581228 22763110 22885922 22955989 23423909 23354976 24013639 12004104 14559957 14728640 8340104 8786073 9334291 9686488 16463022 17341240 18348202 18811610 19010526 19188922
24699409	A central role for GRB10 in regulation of islet function in man.	Variants in the growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) gene were in a GWAS meta-analysis associated with reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) if inherited from the father, but inexplicably reduced fasting glucose when inherited from the mother. GRB10 is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and imprinted in a parent-of-origin fashion in different tissues. GRB10 knock-down in human pancreatic islets showed reduced insulin and glucagon secretion, which together with changes in insulin sensitivity may explain the paradoxical reduction of glucose despite a decrease in insulin secretion. Together, these findings suggest that tissue-specific methylation and possibly imprinting of GRB10 can influence glucose metabolism and contribute to T2D pathogenesis. The data also emphasize the need in genetic studies to consider whether risk alleles are inherited from the mother or the father. 	 19020324 19487367 19715440 20081858 20185807 20454776 20509871 20581827 20634204 21058334 21659605 22108805 22222503 22581228 22553379 22768844 22885922 22885924 22923474 23028138 17463248 17463249 17572673 17701901 17620412 17846126 10861285 10973253 11315092 11313775 12700169 12808457 2106931 2253828 1778354 15614722 15901248 16882277 17293876 17384015 17463246

24700089	Genome-wide association study of HPV-associated cervical cancer in Japanese women.	One of the important factors influencing the development of uterine cervical cancer is human papillomavirus infection in women. Usually, the infecting papillomavirus is eliminated from individuals; however, some retain the virus and this is believed to lead to the development of uterine cervical cancer. It is possible that virus elimination or persistent infection depends on an individual's genetic background. To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to persistent infection or cervical cancer, a genome-wide association study was performed on 226 cases and 186 controls. Some of the single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a P-value < 10(-5); however, no polymorphisms that were significantly associated with susceptibility to cervical cancer were identified.	
24709693	Genome-wide data reveal novel genes for methotrexate response in a large cohort of juvenile idiopathic arthritis cases.	Clinical response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) displays considerable heterogeneity. Currently, there are no reliable predictors to identify non-responders: earlier identification could lead to a targeted treatment. We genotyped 759 JIA cases from the UK, the Netherlands and Czech Republic. Clinical variables were measured at baseline and 6 months after start of the treatment. In Phase I analysis, samples were analysed for the association with MTX response using ordinal regression of ACR-pedi categories and linear regression of change in clinical variables, and identified 31 genetic regions (P<0.001). Phase II analysis increased SNP density in the most strongly associated regions, identifying 14 regions (P<1 × 10(-5)): three contain genes of particular biological interest (ZMIZ1, TGIF1 and CFTR). These data suggest a role for novel pathways in MTX response and further investigations within associated regions will help to reach our goal of predicting response to MTX in JIA. 	 15248217 19915574 17569825 17194218 9214419 16006996 16862161 22482804 19193698 14674002 21177990 18606306 22491018 20615240 21436344 15361393 22138821 16142884 11259615 21102463 11371641 20827233 11510323 23394392 22473625 14760812 19269955 19897727 21500870 20300088 22044941 20634204 17701901 23148518 21515602 16777850 17530705 19667218 18846210 21717596 21560116 22859359 19543373 18417527 22183975 22190364 21452260
24714607	Susceptibility to chronic mucus hypersecretion, a genome wide association study.	Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) is associated with an increased frequency of respiratory infections, excess lung function decline, and increased hospitalisation and mortality rates in the general population. It is associated with smoking, but it is unknown why only a minority of smokers develops CMH. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is a predisposing genetic constitution. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) study of CMH in Caucasian populations.	 19324952 19386687 19955524 20214461 20819636 20884729 21597389 21877163 21930775 21946350 22197577 22080838 23209423 19841453 12374985 14600005 2806492 1505028 8503555 7672054 7582322 8630597 9620904 16120227 16780585 17057718 17330803 17579647 17507545 18062562 18075776 18048810 18216052 18238821
24629169	Genetic effects on information processing speed are moderated by age--converging results from three samples.	Information processing is a cognitive trait forming the basis of complex abilities like executive function. The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a well-established test of information processing with moderate to high heritability. Age of the individual also plays an important role. A number of genetic association studies with the TMT have been performed, which, however, did not consider age as a moderating factor. We report the results of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on age-independent and age-dependent TMT performance in two population-representative community samples (Munich Antidepressant Response Signature, MARS: N1 = 540; Ludwig Maximilians University, LMU: N2 = 350). Age-dependent genome-wide findings were then evaluated in a third sample of healthy elderly subjects (Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, Sydney MAS: N3 = 448). While a meta-analysis on the GWAS findings did not reveal age-independent TMT associations withstanding correction for multiple testing, we found a genome-wide significant age-moderated effect between variants in the DSG1 gene region and TMT-A performance predominantly reflecting visual processing speed (rs2199301, P(meta-analysis) = 1.3 × 10(-7)). The direction of the interaction suggests for the minor allele a beneficial effect in younger adults turning into a detrimental effect in older adults. The detrimental effect of the missense single nucleotide polymorphism rs1426310 within the same DSG1 gene region could be replicated in Sydney MAS participants aged 70-79, but not in those aged 80 years and older, presumably a result of survivor bias. Our findings demonstrate opposing effects of DSG1 variants on information processing speed depending on age, which might be related to the complex processes that DSG1 is involved with, including cell adhesion and apoptosis.	
24728293	Severe osteoarthritis of the hand associates with common variants within the ALDH1A2 gene and with rare variants at 1p31.	Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is a major cause of pain and disability in the elderly. To search for sequence variants that confer risk of osteoarthritis of the hand, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in subjects with severe hand osteoarthritis, using variants identified through the whole-genome sequencing of 2,230 Icelanders. We found two significantly associated loci in the Icelandic discovery set: at 15q22 (frequency of 50.7%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, P = 3.99 × 10(-10)) in the ALDH1A2 gene and at 1p31 (frequency of 0.02%, OR = 50.6, P = 9.8 × 10(-10)). Among the carriers of the variant at 1p31 is a family with several members in whom the risk allele segregates with osteoarthritis. The variants within the ALDH1A2 gene were confirmed in replication sets from The Netherlands and the UK, yielding an overall association of OR = 1.46 and P = 1.1 × 10(-11) (rs3204689). 	 11315092 20499385 20305777 21526222 19165921 22019272 22492780 23989986 21855651 23440512 22318625 23497244 12571848 18344981 21059398 22392533 17053093 8447703 12955859 18805086 17254428 21877163 20140749 18622395 21622766 10192400 16255023 15654335 17113325 19464179 23644456 23193274 23155063 14698640 22763110 9823001 15458958 13655060 20981099 21871595 20634204 21177295 16251894 20112360 22592974 21552415 21068099 20016592 22566624
24736177	Common genetic variants and gene expression associated with white matter microstructure in the human brain.	Identifying genes that contribute to white matter microstructure should provide insights into the neurobiological processes that regulate white matter development, plasticity and pathology. We detected five significant SNPs using genome-wide association analysis on a global measure of fractional anisotropy in 776 individuals from large extended pedigrees. Genetic correlations and genome-wide association results indicated that the genetic signal was largely homogeneous across white matter regions. Using RNA transcripts derived from lymphocytes in the same individuals, we identified two genes (GNA13 and CCDC91) that are likely to be cis-regulated by top SNPs, and whose expression levels were also genetically correlated with fractional anisotropy. A transcript of HTR7 was phenotypically associated with FA, and was associated with an intronic genome-wide significant SNP. These results encourage further research in the mechanisms by which GNA13, HTR7 and CCDC91 influence brain structure, and emphasize a role for g-protein signaling in the development and maintenance of white matter microstructure in health and disease. 	 10486333 23218918 12489094 14587019 8651310 8842523 8901667 9433606 9545414 15559250 15716906 16120784 16400619 16624579 16921375 16023676 17258908 17292629 17503736 17551261 17873875 18255317 18348202 18803320 17925794 18804959 18668031 19229203 19474294 19226283 19847044 19896972 20808825 20117221 20961428 20950689 21232925 21195196 21385236 21557468 21358711 21429475 21818250 21982424 21803153 22539856 22504417 22573399 22425255 22723713 23453289 23629049 23974872 24185242 23958183 22621900 22955616 22955828 22996553 23240599 22878161 23419715 23471985 11923294

24737748	Identification of susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer in a genome-wide meta-analysis.	To identify common variants influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, we performed a meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies, comprising 5626 cases and 7817 controls of European descent. We conducted replication of top ranked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in additional series totalling 14 037 cases and 15 937 controls, identifying a new CRC risk locus at 10q24.2 [rs1035209; odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, P = 4.54 × 10(-11)]. We also performed meta-analysis of our studies, with previously published data, of several recently purported CRC risk loci. We failed to find convincing evidence for a previously reported genome-wide association at rs11903757 (2q32.3). Of the three additional loci for which evidence of an association in Europeans has been previously described we failed to show an association between rs59336 (12q24.21) and CRC risk. However, for the other two SNPs, our analyses demonstrated new, formally significant associations with CRC. These are rs3217810 intronic in CCND2 (12p13.32; OR = 1.19, P = 2.16 × 10(-10)) and rs10911251 near LAMC1 (1q25.3; OR = 1.09, P = 1.75 × 10(-8)). Additionally, we found some evidence to support a relationship between, rs647161, rs2423297 and rs10774214 and CRC risk originally identified in East Asians in our European datasets. Our findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC. 	 15652360 15965027 16012517 16228001 16155052 21076612 21304890 21655089 21734724 22064851 22634755 22955989 23263487 23266556 22786799 10891514 12029063 12083850 12111919 12366691 8114738 8797578 9823339 15543147 19920828 16362079 17200375 17289997 17167069 17401363 17529973 17701901 17895893 17934461 17982118 19307499 19644074 19508551 20657582 20837956 20972440

24740154	Genome-wide association scan for variants associated with early-onset prostate cancer.	Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality for men in the United States. There is strong empirical and epidemiological evidence supporting a stronger role of genetics in early-onset prostate cancer. We performed a genome-wide association scan for early-onset prostate cancer. Novel aspects of this study include the focus on early-onset disease (defined as men with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 56 years) and use of publically available control genotype data from previous genome-wide association studies. We found genome-wide significant (p<5×10(-8)) evidence for variants at 8q24 and 11p15 and strong supportive evidence for a number of previously reported loci. We found little evidence for individual or systematic inflated association findings resulting from using public controls, demonstrating the utility of using public control data in large-scale genetic association studies of common variants. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of established common genetic variants for early-onset prostate cancer and the power of including early-onset prostate cancer cases in genetic association studies.	 19715440 19466697 19767752 19767753 19767754 20821337 21058334 21602798 21685461 21743467 21743057 21538423 22236224 22308973 22198737 23535732 22841674 11315092 11992050 12673715 14601029 15568195 15819990 16138915 16532393 16682969 16862161 16945910 17529973 17401366 17401363 17603485 17701901 18073375 18264096 18264097 18264098 18703928 18708398 19035517 19648217
24722205	A genome-wide association study on thyroid function and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies in Koreans.	Genetic factors are thought to be an important determinant of thyroid function and autoimmunity. However, there are limited data on genetic variants in Asians. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study on plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) concentration and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody positivity in 4238 Korean subjects. In the Stage 1 genome scan, 3396 participants from the Ansung cohort were investigated using 1.42 million genotyped or imputed markers. In the Stage 2 follow-up, 10 markers were genotyped in 842 participants from the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging cohort. An intronic variant in VAV3, rs12126655, which has been reported in Europeans, was significantly associated with plasma TSH concentration in the joint Stages 1 and 2 analyses (P = 2.2 × 10(-8)). We observed that a novel variant, rs2071403, located 75 bp proximal to the translational start site of TPO was significantly associated with plasma anti-TPO antibody positivity in the joint Stages 1 and 2 analyses (P = 1.3 × 10(-10)). This variant had a marginal sex-specific effect, and its association was more significant in females. Subjects possessing the rs2071403A allele, associated with an absence of the anti-TPO antibody, had decreased TPO mRNA expression in their thyroid tissue. Another intronic variant of HLA-DPB2, rs733208, had a suggestive association with anti-TPO antibody positivity (P = 4.2 × 10(-7)). In conclusion, we have identified genetic variants that are strongly associated with TSH level and anti-TPO antibody positivity in Koreans. Further replications and meta-analysis are required to confirm these findings. 	 16767097 22267200 19088377 19197348 17016550 6503723 11889165 22922229 9752802 19033363 17572673 22493691 21841780 23529038 19352319 18514160 14681412 20616382 24285689 10523675 20826269 16807415 7550241 15863666 22692505 23408906 23612905 17701901 20660303 21167468 8651700 19131956 19396169 10802651 14685227 9399875 24124408 20208533
24743840	Genome-wide diet-gene interaction analyses for risk of colorectal cancer.	Dietary factors, including meat, fruits, vegetables and fiber, are associated with colorectal cancer; however, there is limited information as to whether these dietary factors interact with genetic variants to modify risk of colorectal cancer. We tested interactions between these dietary factors and approximately 2.7 million genetic variants for colorectal cancer risk among 9,287 cases and 9,117 controls from ten studies. We used logistic regression to investigate multiplicative gene-diet interactions, as well as our recently developed Cocktail method that involves a screening step based on marginal associations and gene-diet correlations and a testing step for multiplicative interactions, while correcting for multiple testing using weighted hypothesis testing. Per quartile increment in the intake of red and processed meat were associated with statistically significant increased risks of colorectal cancer and vegetable, fruit and fiber intake with lower risks. From the case-control analysis, we detected a significant interaction between rs4143094 (10p14/near GATA3) and processed meat consumption (OR = 1.17; p = 8.7E-09), which was consistently observed across studies (p heterogeneity = 0.78). The risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat was increased among individuals with the rs4143094-TG and -TT genotypes (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.39, respectively) and null among those with the GG genotype (OR = 1.03). Our results identify a novel gene-diet interaction with processed meat for colorectal cancer, highlighting that diet may modify the effect of genetic variants on disease risk, which may have important implications for prevention.	 14388528 21749975 15947874 16862161 17701906 21779441 8122051 17982118 20663065 19339391 19022827 9492970 8988044 20495462 16255080 21769935 20407088 23873611 22367214 16352792 15864280 18300295 23263487 20969588 8037405 19017806 18200594 23428429 17919486 21200035 22438055 22714933 10691066 23462924 19011631 16415888 23266556 21284036 8801636 22237781 18990750 17627011 17557210 23211939 22961839 20711421 23193274 23843674 17554300 17618283 17618284 19606090 18200600 18348202 11189684 18372905 17934461 18162111 22467146 18372901 19798694 21357381

While genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified several genetic risk factors for BD, few of these studies have investigated the genetic etiology of specific disease subtypes. In particular, BD is positively associated with eating dysregulation traits such as binge eating behavior (BE), yet the genetic risk factors underlying BD with comorbid BE have not been investigated.	 12917364 21423873 22205951 20812900 9861464 16862161 18193043 17525972 22214661 21868729 21071093 21294998 16690869 17898773 9850207 19150704 21900884 23144589 18711365 12742871 22820512 21926972 23742827 21738484 21243474 21829488 20724638 17283440 22676371 23092918 24322204 20528957 17554300 18379420 18821183 15142614 22978403 16520437 17701901 23269371 19899849 18095307 21635931 18191226 19488044 24001487 23628988 22217451 17954136 23072837

24755620	Overrepresentation of glutamate signaling in Alzheimer's disease: network-based pathway enrichment using meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, these loci do not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease, suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified. Here, we performed a meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540 cases and 2,029 healthy controls) derived from three publicly available GWAS in AD and replicated a broad genomic region (>248,000 bp) associated with the disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19. To detect minor effect size contributions that could help to explain the remaining genetic risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either by extracting gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest association signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure. Comparison of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks (SNs) involved in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented in AD (p<2.7×10(-11), p<1.9×10(-11); GW and GATES, respectively). Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly overrepresented (p<5.1×10(-8)) in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used as a targeted replication sample. Interestingly, components of the glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD. Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological disorder.	 20451872 17947979 22410582 22532703 21729715 10592173 16862161 8446617 21263141 22840751 1995774 12130773 19286671 21840719 15225164 20388643 12169552 20594621 19001172 14681407 16255080 17898773 17474819 20930298 3802833 16020784 15180930 19734902 21627779 21816037 22865056 21390209 19130231 22894822 16242627 22792080 22996553 21460840 19734903 18722519 17192785 19916168 21379329 17360908 19752451 20029386 21058334 14681465 24162737 20576703 16282215 17701901 22869155 22809392 19076369 16107369 17848398 20043717 9697689 21029852 21397060 16268787 21825236 17553421 21045058 8350998 19621072

24763700	New variants including ARG1 polymorphisms associated with C-reactive protein levels identified by genome-wide association and pathway analysis.	C-reactive protein (CRP) is a general marker of systemic inflammation and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The genetic contribution to differences in CRP levels remains to be explained, especially in non-European populations. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify genetic loci associated with CRP levels in Korean population. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using SNPs from 8,529 Korean individuals (7,626 for stage 1 and 903 for stage 2). We also performed pathway analysis. We identified a new genetic locus associated with CRP levels upstream of ARG1 gene (top significant SNP: rs9375813, Pmeta = 2.85×10(-8)), which encodes a key enzyme of the urea cycle counteract the effects of nitric oxide, in addition to known CRP (rs7553007, Pmeta = 1.72×10(-16)) and HNF1A loci (rs2259816, Pmeta = 2.90×10(-10)). When we evaluated the associations between the CRP-related SNPs with cardiovascular disease phenotypes, rs9375813 (ARG1) showed a marginal association with hypertension (P = 0.0440). To identify more variants and pathways, we performed pathway analysis and identified six candidate pathways comprised of genes related to inflammatory processes and CVDs (CRP, HNF1A, PCSK6, CD36, and ABCA1). In addition to the previously reported loci (CRP, HNF1A, and IL6) in diverse ethnic groups, we identified novel variants in the ARG1 locus associated with CRP levels in Korean population and a number of interesting genes related to inflammatory processes and CVD through pathway analysis.	 22801476 18974171 23908247 19304780 21704615 19764983 21085122 21085203 11257270 18167554 18439548 20460509 17369504 19369657 23245808 24367219 23565202 20501604 23625363 21233852 18436799 17966091 16534007 17572673 20946675 14639702 21196492 12813022 23393188 15205215 12788804 18439552 15297300 21622953 19376978 22939635 19008531 22957222 20887962 21909109 12928471 18722519 22456541 20576703 20476927 21672356 17701901 11560944 22189190 15276021 19567438 19396169 22492993 16013195 22788528 19816713
24770850	Genome-wide association study of sexual maturation in males and females highlights a role for body mass and menarche loci in male puberty.	Little is known about genes regulating male puberty. Further, while many identified pubertal timing variants associate with age at menarche, a late manifestation of puberty, and body mass, little is known about these variants' relationship to pubertal initiation or tempo. To address these questions, we performed genome-wide association meta-analysis in over 11 000 European samples with data on early pubertal traits, male genital and female breast development, measured by the Tanner scale. We report the first genome-wide significant locus for male sexual development upstream of myocardin-like 2 (MKL2) (P = 8.9 × 10(-9)), a menarche locus tagging a developmental pathway linking earlier puberty with reduced pubertal growth (P = 4.6 × 10(-5)) and short adult stature (p = 7.5 × 10(-6)) in both males and females. Furthermore, our results indicate that a proportion of menarche loci are important for pubertal initiation in both sexes. Consistent with epidemiological correlations between increased prepubertal body mass and earlier pubertal timing in girls, body mass index (BMI)-increasing alleles correlated with earlier breast development. In boys, some BMI-increasing alleles associated with earlier, and others with delayed, sexual development; these genetic results mimic the controversy in epidemiological studies, some of which show opposing correlations between prepubertal BMI and male puberty. Our results contribute to our understanding of the pubertal initiation program in both sexes and indicate that although mechanisms regulating pubertal onset in males and females may largely be shared, the relationship between body mass and pubertal timing in boys may be complex and requires further genetic studies. 	 21104887 22532805 22499221 19448621 23558354 17506689 22914739 21179014 20543033 20714348 20372150 10669750 20231167 22338106 10713105 18241078 23449627 18381517 22570961 16381825 19715440 22886576 23430788 20398887 16472389 17572673 23599027 5785179 20881960 23283660 12359788 19448622 22955616 19448620 21102462 19448623 20509871 20935630 23754948 16607921 21106904 21484909 12729400 5440182 23164700 20233392 23601607 22484627 11397824 21058334 11719514 24728292 21304890 19266077 17924348 22955989 17701901 23791931 18245514 15452575 22290357 17924335 21757498 21916558 20702402 24438232 11914195 10940339 10639158 21470270 19543373
24770881	ABCC9 gene polymorphism is associated with hippocampal sclerosis of aging pathology.	Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a high-morbidity brain disease in the elderly but risk factors are largely unknown. We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) with HS-Aging pathology as an endophenotype. In collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, data were analyzed from large autopsy cohorts: (#1) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC); (#2) Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; (#3) Group Health Research Institute Adult Changes in Thought study; (#4) University of California at Irvine 90+ Study; and (#5) University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center. Altogether, 363 HS-Aging cases and 2,303 controls, all pathologically confirmed, provided statistical power to test for risk alleles with large effect size. A two-tier study design included GWAS from cohorts #1-3 (Stage I) to identify promising SNP candidates, followed by focused evaluation of particular SNPs in cohorts #4-5 (Stage II). Polymorphism in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9) gene, also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2, was associated with HS-Aging pathology. In the meta-analyzed Stage I GWAS, ABCC9 polymorphisms yielded the lowest p values, and factoring in the Stage II results, the meta-analyzed risk SNP (rs704178:G) attained genome-wide statistical significance (p = 1.4 × 10(-9)), with odds ratio (OR) of 2.13 (recessive mode of inheritance). For SNPs previously linked to hippocampal sclerosis, meta-analyses of Stage I results show OR = 1.16 for rs5848 (GRN) and OR = 1.22 rs1990622 (TMEM106B), with the risk alleles as previously described. Sulfonylureas, a widely prescribed drug class used to treat diabetes, also modify human ABCC9 protein function. A subsample of patients from the NACC database (n = 624) were identified who were older than age 85 at death with known drug history. Controlling for important confounders such as diabetes itself, exposure to a sulfonylurea drug was associated with risk for HS-Aging pathology (p = 0.03). Thus, we describe a novel and targetable dementia risk factor. 	 21460841 12117357 19012619 10022104 22471869 17266119 22471862 20838928 17906306 17469117 22855871 20664073 12565699 24270205 17003490 24439875 17195931 8307060 16544872 18300295 22608503 22471863 23656988 22950047 24316576 22471861 18200594 23300413 24352916 17023659 18401022 11782049 20197700 16897043 7810292 22101365 18596243 15729734 24659241 21460840 8630239 19125255 23715323 21167019 18724049 22895581 8929997 1737657 24162737 15910878 19924424 21092373 17879383 19797704 24271328 20634204 21516511 16837559 22420316 21344641 23864344 10224138 23780892 12210352 18310059 22647261 17917073 18723524 22610116 8826984 21596774 11310586 18713571 15592144 17804958 19021630 23538276 16237129 21346515 17035694

24800985	Genome-wide association study of maternal and inherited loci for conotruncal heart defects.	Conotruncal and related heart defects (CTDs) are a group of serious and relatively common birth defects. Although both maternal and inherited genotypes are thought to play a role in the etiology of CTDs, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. To determine whether common variants acting through the genotype of the mother (e.g. via an in utero effect) or the case are associated with CTDs, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 750 CTD case-parent triads, with follow-up analyses in 358 independent triads. Log-linear analyses were used to assess the association of CTDs with the genotypes of both the mother and case. No association achieved genomewide significance in either the discovery or combined (discovery+follow-up) samples. However, three loci with p-values suggestive of association (p<10-5) in the discovery sample had p-values <0.05 in the follow-up sample and p-values in the combined data that were lower than in the discovery sample. These included suggestive association with an inherited intergenic variant at 20p12.3 (rs6140038, combined p = 1.0 × 10(-5)) and an inherited intronic variant in KCNJ4 at 22q13.1 (rs2267386, combined p = 9.8 × 10(-6)), as well as with a maternal variant in SLC22A24 at 11q12.3 (rs11231379, combined p = 4.2 × 10(-6)). These observations suggest novel candidate loci for CTDs, including loci that appear to be associated with the risk of CTDs via the maternal genotype, but further studies are needed to confirm these associations.	 21564312 21254360 21987465 22419666 22495907 23088992 23155063 23297363 23705960 23708190 23708191 23604262 11419896 11688566 12084585 12375236 14654648 15075390 15211708 6344145 1884513 8016146 9369870 9529360 9708481 9801020 10090904 10525349 15741364 16100725 17295158 17493305 17701901 17683628 17729292 17714910 18976480 19514467 19493349 19597048 19592680 19635485 19835857 20031554 19858363 19777601 20111745 20354512 20592181 20664391 21152010 21513519
24811271	Genome-wide SNP associations with rubella-specific cytokine responses in measles-mumps-rubella vaccine recipients.	Genetic polymorphisms are known to affect responses to both viral infection and vaccination. Our previous work has described genetic polymorphisms significantly associated with variations in immune response to rubella vaccine from multiple gene families with known immune function, including HLA, cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, and in genes controlling innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we assessed cellular immune responses (IFNγ and IL-6) in a cohort of healthy younger individuals and performed genome-wide SNP analysis on these same individuals. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study focused on immune responses following rubella vaccination. Our results indicate that rs16928280 in protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD) and a collection of SNPs in ACO1 (encoding an iron regulatory protein) are associated with interindividual variations in IFNγ response to rubella virus stimulation. In contrast, we did not identify any significant genetic associations with rubella-specific IL-6 response. These genetic regions may influence rubella vaccine-induced IFNγ responses and warrant further studies in additional cohorts in order to confirm these findings. 	 18715339 11315092 4893832 16862161 23009887 22542470 9419163 10623741 17152005 22086389 22285888 22661280 19896518 5424733 20807954 22253303 19200845 20976024 20001730 20923569 20217072 4405976 11257374 22610502 4884671 20668555 15603879 17732761 15655774 20117947 5794813 20079393 19902255 4978508 19761839

24824216	Genome-wide interaction studies reveal sex-specific asthma risk alleles.	Asthma is a complex disease with sex-specific differences in prevalence. Candidate gene studies have suggested that genotype-by-sex interaction effects on asthma risk exist, but this has not yet been explored at a genome-wide level. We aimed to identify sex-specific asthma risk alleles by performing a genome-wide scan for genotype-by-sex interactions in the ethnically diverse participants in the EVE Asthma Genetics Consortium. We performed male- and female-specific genome-wide association studies in 2653 male asthma cases, 2566 female asthma cases and 3830 non-asthma controls from European American, African American, African Caribbean and Latino populations. Association tests were conducted in each study sample, and the results were combined in ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry meta-analyses. Six sex-specific asthma risk loci had P-values < 1 × 10(-6), of which two were male specific and four were female specific; all were ancestry specific. The most significant sex-specific association in European Americans was at the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) locus on 5q31.1. We also identify a Latino female-specific association in RAP1GAP2. Both of these loci included single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are known expression quantitative trait loci and have been associated with asthma in independent studies. The IRF1 locus is a strong candidate region for male-specific asthma susceptibility due to the association and validation we demonstrate here, the known role of IRF1 in asthma-relevant immune pathways and prior reports of sex-specific differences in interferon responses. 	 16429159 10190920 16632515 17157669 17463246 17543724 17668381 17873877 17907809 18096710 18467348 18535015 19002143 18974171 19528539 19536153 19747114 20020740 20502693 20717975 20860503 20935629 20560908 20833654 21058334 21804549 21798578 21949713 22112518 21858542 22142547 22446964 22692763 23040885 23209423 23146381 23754948 23873611 24037378 24183450 15851067 11240951 12818904 12912767 14657864 15080825 7468783 15772666 15632203 2696846 16961714
24825563	Common genetic variants associated with resting oxygenation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Hypoxemia is a major complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that correlates with disease prognosis. Identifying genetic variants associated with oxygenation may provide clues for deciphering the heterogeneity in prognosis among patients with COPD. However, previous genetic studies have been restricted to investigating COPD candidate genes for association with hypoxemia. To report results from the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of resting oxygen saturation (as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo2]) in subjects with COPD, we performed a GWAS of Spo2 in two large, well characterized COPD populations: COPDGene, including both the non-Hispanic white (NHW) and African American (AA) groups, and Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE). We identified several suggestive loci (P < 1 × 10(-5)) associated with Spo2 in COPDGene in the NHW (n = 2810) and ECLIPSE (n = 1758) groups, and two loci on chromosomes 14 and 15 in the AA group (n = 820) from COPDGene achieving a level of genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). The chromosome 14 single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs6576132, located in an intergenic region, was nominally replicated (P < 0.05) in the NHW group from COPDGene. The chromosome 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rare in subjects of European ancestry, so the results could not be replicated. The chromosome 15 region contains several genes, including TICRR and KIF7, and is proximal to RHCG (Rh family C glyocoprotein gene). We have identified two loci associated with resting oxygen saturation in AA subjects with COPD, and several suggestive regions in subjects of European descent with COPD. Our study highlights the importance of investigating the genetics of complex traits in different racial groups.	 23704573 23715539 23758905 23349118 23731023 23754303 24621683 24979972 12598704 12809623 3396392 15718463 15947301 15961204 17089004 17701901 18191558 20634204 20890907 20956315 21030426 18216052 18339622 18852204 18693004 19000905 19017876 19300482 19131638 19830829 20010835 20173748 20214461 20534544 20595611 20598278 21396809 22064851 22080838 22068265 22729570 22795506 23128226 23130672 22878278 23047478 23553563 23490227 23650387
24821223	Genome-wide association study in obsessive-compulsive disorder: results from the OCGAS.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by intrusive thoughts and urges and repetitive, intentional behaviors that cause significant distress and impair functioning. The OCD Collaborative Genetics Association Study (OCGAS) is comprised of comprehensively assessed OCD patients with an early age of OCD onset. After application of a stringent quality control protocol, a total of 1065 families (containing 1406 patients with OCD), combined with population-based samples (resulting in a total sample of 5061 individuals), were studied. An integrative analyses pipeline was utilized, involving association testing at single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene levels (via a hybrid approach that allowed for combined analyses of the family- and population-based data). The smallest P-value was observed for a marker on chromosome 9 (near PTPRD, P=4.13 × 10(-)(7)). Pre-synaptic PTPRD promotes the differentiation of glutamatergic synapses and interacts with SLITRK3. Together, both proteins selectively regulate the development of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Although no SNPs were identified as associated with OCD at genome-wide significance level, follow-up analyses of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals from a previously published OCD study identified significant enrichment (P=0.0176). Secondary analyses of high-confidence interaction partners of DLGAP1 and GRIK2 (both showing evidence for association in our follow-up and the original GWAS study) revealed a trend of association (P=0.075) for a set of genes such as NEUROD6, SV2A, GRIA4, SLC1A2 and PTPRD. Analyses at the gene level revealed association of IQCK and C16orf88 (both P<1 × 10(-)(6), experiment-wide significant), as well as OFCC1 (P=6.29 × 10(-)(5)). The suggestive findings in this study await replication in larger samples. 	 23606572 20981092 21445956 21520241 21079607 21880815 21963369 22110034 22024159 22286174 22502986 21747397 21924871 10768697 10856223 12116192 14685227 14740322 15272418 2228931 8077177 15674434 15750591 16224024 16818866 16818867 16755275 17283288 17502601 17701901 17713528 23337130 17898773 22889921 23699935 18660810 18677311 19252495 19349310 19404256 19571808 19152386 20159344 19569082 20346434 20139422 20418887 19546859 20562413 20616382 20711177 21262467
24837172	Genome-wide association scan in north Indians reveals three novel HLA-independent risk loci for ulcerative colitis.	Over 100 ulcerative colitis (UC) loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) primarily in Caucasians (CEUs). Many of them have weak effects on disease susceptibility, and the bulk of the heritability cannot be ascribed to these loci. Very little is known about the genetic background of UC in non-CEU groups. Here we report the first GWAS on UC in a genetically distinct north Indian (NI) population.	
24836286	Large-scale genetic study in East Asians identifies six new loci associated with colorectal cancer risk.	Known genetic loci explain only a small proportion of the familial relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a genome-wide association study of CRC in East Asians with 14,963 cases and 31,945 controls and identified 6 new loci associated with CRC risk (P = 3.42 × 10(-8) to 9.22 × 10(-21)) at 10q22.3, 10q25.2, 11q12.2, 12p13.31, 17p13.3 and 19q13.2. Two of these loci map to genes (TCF7L2 and TGFB1) with established roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. Four other loci are located in or near genes involved in transcriptional regulation (ZMIZ1), genome maintenance (FEN1), fatty acid metabolism (FADS1 and FADS2), cancer cell motility and metastasis (CD9), and cell growth and differentiation (NXN). We also found suggestive evidence for three additional loci associated with CRC risk near genome-wide significance at 8q24.11, 10q21.1 and 10q24.2. Furthermore, we replicated 22 previously reported CRC-associated loci. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of CRC and suggests the involvement of new biological pathways. 	 20729852 20634204 20603617 20887962 21892161 22002653 22064851 22064864 22072618 22307276 22634755 22810696 22820512 22955616 22941192 23128226 23263487 23263490 23376950 12119409 12750287 15052270 15510158 9382404 9582123 9626469 9783545 9887336 15297300 16293724 16604061 16670158 16862161 17018619 17075120 17200375 17589521 17567240 17618283 17618284 17701901 17582603 17943122 17934461 18084292 18372901 18372905 18621708 18703712 19011631 18974171 19219042 19561590 19417063 23266556 23535729 23535732 23535825 23715323 23426136 24013639 23946381 24448986 20972440 21058334 20952405 20929870 21296855 21383188 21526158 21357381 21242260 21655089 10725360 10891514 11693338 19648918 20018966 20354512 20453838 20581239 20512145 20616382
24842889	Genome-wide mapping of IBD segments in an Ashkenazi PD cohort identifies associated haplotypes.	The recent series of large genome-wide association studies in European and Japanese cohorts established that Parkinson disease (PD) has a substantial genetic component. To further investigate the genetic landscape of PD, we performed a genome-wide scan in the largest to date Ashkenazi Jewish cohort of 1130 Parkinson patients and 2611 pooled controls. Motivated by the reduced disease allele heterogeneity and a high degree of identical-by-descent (IBD) haplotype sharing in this founder population, we conducted a haplotype association study based on mapping of shared IBD segments. We observed significant haplotype association signals at three previously implicated Parkinson loci: LRRK2 (OR = 12.05, P = 1.23 × 10(-56)), MAPT (OR = 0.62, P = 1.78 × 10(-11)) and GBA (multiple distinct haplotypes, OR > 8.28, P = 1.13 × 10(-11) and OR = 2.50, P = 1.22 × 10(-9)). In addition, we identified a novel association signal on chr2q14.3 coming from a rare haplotype (OR = 22.58, P = 1.21 × 10(-10)) and replicated it in a secondary cohort of 306 Ashkenazi PD cases and 2583 controls. Our results highlight the power of our haplotype association method, particularly useful in studies of founder populations, and reaffirm the benefits of studying complex diseases in Ashkenazi Jewish cohorts. 	 11715044 23939255 12209575 12402217 12672864 14520664 14728640 7719352 8917744 9744474 15525722 15654335 16436782 17050822 17082464 17875915 17938369 18434642 18606306 18985386 18971310 19297401 19915575 19915576 20116045 20208533 20560205 20346443 20691406 21044948 21118897 21292315 21620352 21738487 21812969 22232350 21984068 22412388 22277159 22892372 11744826
24847101	Genome-wide association study of the plasma triglyceride response to an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation.	Studies have shown a large interindividual variability in plasma TG response to long-chain n-3 PUFA supplementation, which may likely be attributable to genetic variability within the populations studied. The objective is to compare the frequency of SNPs in a genome-wide association study between responders (reduction in plasma TG levels ≥0.01 mM) and nonresponders (increase in plasma TG of ≥0 mM) to supplementation. Genomic DNA from 141 subjects who completed a 2-week run-in period followed by 6-week supplementation with 5 g of fish oil daily (1.9-2.2 g EPA and 1.1 g DHA daily) were genotyped on Illumina HumanOmni-5-QuadBeadChip. Thirteen loci had frequency differences between responders and nonresponders (P < 1 × 10(-5)), including SNPs in or near IQCJ-SCHIP1, MYB, NELL1, NXPH1, PHF17, and SLIT2 genes. A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed by summing the number of risk alleles. This GRS explained 21.53% of the variation in TG response to n-3 PUFA supplementation when adjusted for age, sex, and BMI (P = 0.0002). Using Fish Oil Intervention and Genotype as a replication cohort, the GRS was able to explain 2% of variation in TG response when adjusted. In conclusion, subjects who decrease their plasma TG levels following n-3 PUFA supplementation may have a different genetic profile than individuals who do not respond.	 4337382 19474137 15735069 13806309 16059715 12765846 18779276 19266045 23016130 11700160 23250786 24646652 23356247 19748619 207461 23689286 19008343 5959431 23192668 20816195 16451692 5576952 10938022 18362042 20935630 5166455 12011103 18976480 9129504 7249269 18254017 23400010 21568708
24850809	Genetic determinants of P wave duration and PR segment.	The PR interval on the ECG reflects atrial depolarization and atrioventricular nodal delay which can be partially differentiated by P wave duration and PR segment, respectively. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic loci for PR interval, but it remains to be determined whether this is driven by P wave duration, PR segment, or both.	 22138689 23400760 22286219 22421339 22682221 22474228 22706305 22936215 22955617 22955828 23139255 12097364 12356629 17719341 18075776 19237396 19369661 19617600 20062060 20062061 20062063 20729851 20944595 21347284 21415370 21576278 23263488 23409044 22359512
24852370	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility gene for serum TSH levels in Chinese populations.	Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a sensitive indicator of thyroid function. High and low TSH levels reflect hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively. Even within the normal range, small differences in TSH levels, on the order of 0.5-1.0 mU/l, are associated with significant differences in blood pressure, BMI, dyslipidemia, risk of atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis. Most of the variance in TSH levels is thought to be genetically influenced. We conducted a genome-wide association study of TSH levels in 1346 Chinese Han individuals. In the replication study, we genotyped four candidate SNPs with the top association signals in an independent isolated Chinese She cohort (n = 3235). We identified a novel serum TSH susceptibility locus within XKR4 at 8q12.1 (rs2622590, Pcombined = 2.21 × 10(-10)), and we confirmed two previously reported TSH susceptibility loci near FOXE1 at 9q22.33 and near CAPZB at 1p36.13, respectively. The rs2622590_T allele at XKR4 and the rs925489_C allele near FOXE1 were correlated with low TSH levels and were found to be nominally associated to patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (OR = 1.41, P= 0.014 for rs2622590_T, and OR = 1.61, P= 0.030 for rs925489_C). The rs2622590 and rs925489 genotypes were also correlated with the expression levels of FOXE1 and XKR4, respectively, in PTC tissues (P = 2.41 × 10(-4) and P= 0.02). Our findings suggest that the SNPs in XKR4 and near FOXE1 are involved in the regulation of TSH levels. 	
24861553	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in East Asian-ancestry populations identifies four new loci for body mass index.	Recent genetic association studies have identified 55 genetic loci associated with obesity or body mass index (BMI). The vast majority, 51 loci, however, were identified in European-ancestry populations. We conducted a meta-analysis of associations between BMI and ∼2.5 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms among 86 757 individuals of Asian ancestry, followed by in silico and de novo replication among 7488-47 352 additional Asian-ancestry individuals. We identified four novel BMI-associated loci near the KCNQ1 (rs2237892, P = 9.29 × 10(-13)), ALDH2/MYL2 (rs671, P = 3.40 × 10(-11); rs12229654, P = 4.56 × 10(-9)), ITIH4 (rs2535633, P = 1.77 × 10(-10)) and NT5C2 (rs11191580, P = 3.83 × 10(-8)) genes. The association of BMI with rs2237892, rs671 and rs12229654 was significantly stronger among men than among women. Of the 51 BMI-associated loci initially identified in European-ancestry populations, we confirmed eight loci at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) and an additional 14 at P < 1.0 × 10(-3) with the same direction of effect as reported previously. Findings from this analysis expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of obesity. 	 12587002 11315092 14661079 6582480 2206485 9602042 17434869 17873874 17575325 18318597 17658951 18454148 18846210 19079260 19079261 18711367 19151714 19305409 19396169 19252135 19561590 19417063 19698717 20139978 20354512 20220756 20421936 20502693 20581827 20651683 19430483 20935630 21270382 21372407 21572416 21909109 21909115 22016621 22013104 22134356 22071413 21971053 21898408 22344219 22344221 22171074 22286173 22414228 22484627 22688191 23001569 23166209 21909110 22551939 23364394 23453885 23563607 23754948 23575436 24262325 14726171
24861552	Genome-wide association study yields variants at 20p12.2 that associate with urinary bladder cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of urinary bladder cancer (UBC) have yielded common variants at 12 loci that associate with risk of the disease. We report here the results of a GWAS of UBC including 1670 UBC cases and 90 180 controls, followed by replication analysis in additional 5266 UBC cases and 10 456 controls. We tested a dataset containing 34.2 million variants, generated by imputation based on whole-genome sequencing of 2230 Icelanders. Several correlated variants at 20p12, represented by rs62185668, show genome-wide significant association with UBC after combining discovery and replication results (OR = 1.19, P = 1.5 × 10(-11) for rs62185668-A, minor allele frequency = 23.6%). The variants are located in a non-coding region approximately 300 kb upstream from the JAG1 gene, an important component of the Notch signaling pathways that may be oncogenic or tumor suppressive in several forms of cancer. Our results add to the growing number of UBC risk variants discovered through GWAS. 	
24871463	GWAS identifies novel SLE susceptibility genes and explains the association of the HLA region.	In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals of European ancestry afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) the extensive utilization of imputation, step-wise multiple regression, lasso regularization and increasing study power by utilizing false discovery rate instead of a Bonferroni multiple test correction enabled us to identify 13 novel non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and confirmed the association of four genes previously reported to be associated. Novel genes associated with SLE susceptibility included two transcription factors (EHF and MED1), two components of the NF-κB pathway (RASSF2 and RNF114), one gene involved in adhesion and endothelial migration (CNTN6) and two genes involved in antigen presentation (BIN1 and SEC61G). In addition, the strongly significant association of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region was assigned to HLA alleles and serotypes and deconvoluted into four primary signals. The novel SLE-associated genes point to new directions for both the diagnosis and treatment of this debilitating autoimmune disease. 	 9324032 22216125 17595377 19216798 23128226 21571784 20808728 18050247 17943122 18516230 15657875 23253915 23053960 22820512 23056405 18179884 20354512 20517342 10192503 22286218 22203994 7138600 11823543 19561590 23459081 19440200 18204446 21300701 11729172 19758183 23084292 18204448 23236436 23071254

24880342	Rare variants of large effect in BRCA2 and CHEK2 affect risk of lung cancer.	We conducted imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project of four genome-wide association studies of lung cancer in populations of European ancestry (11,348 cases and 15,861 controls) and genotyped an additional 10,246 cases and 38,295 controls for follow-up. We identified large-effect genome-wide associations for squamous lung cancer with the rare variants BRCA2 p.Lys3326X (rs11571833, odds ratio (OR) = 2.47, P = 4.74 × 10(-20)) and CHEK2 p.Ile157Thr (rs17879961, OR = 0.38, P = 1.27 × 10(-13)). We also showed an association between common variation at 3q28 (TP63, rs13314271, OR = 1.13, P = 7.22 × 10(-10)) and lung adenocarcinoma that had been previously reported only in Asians. These findings provide further evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and its biological basis. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that imputation can identify rare disease-causing variants with substantive effects on cancer risk from preexisting genome-wide association study data. 	 17517688 17701901 17895893 18538025 18715499 18978787 18978790 21862624 22306651 22585858 22820512 22980975 22960745 22899653 23143601 23209423 23535729 23644456 23713947 10570174 10592368 10733923 10871867 11861370 12015775 14515059 15286464 8137335 8205268 8896551 10433620 17724471 18048390 18281249 18974171 19151717 19424496 19543373 19654303 19836008 20016592 20233392 20418888 20871597 21058334 21351269 21412013 20517342 21725308 21926387 21911369 12029063 12496042 12958120 18385738 18385739 18372903 18385676 18317453 15695382 15806175 16141007 16228001 16054167 16311244 17264676 17554300
24886709	Amerindian-specific regions under positive selection harbour new lipid variants in Latinos.	Dyslipidemia and obesity are especially prevalent in populations with Amerindian backgrounds, such as Mexican-Americans, which predispose these populations to cardiovascular disease. Here we design an approach, known as the cross-population allele screen (CPAS), which we conduct prior to a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,273 Europeans and Mexicans, in order to identify Amerindian risk genes in Mexicans. Utilizing CPAS to restrict the GWAS input variants to only those differing in frequency between the two populations, we identify novel Amerindian lipid genes, receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) and salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3), and three loci previously unassociated with dyslipidemia or obesity. We also detect lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) harbouring specific Amerindian signatures of risk variants and haplotypes. Notably, we observe that SIK3 and one novel lipid locus underwent positive selection in Mexicans. Furthermore, after a high-fat meal, the SIK3 risk variant carriers display high triglyceride levels. These findings suggest that Amerindian-specific genetic architecture leads to a higher incidence of dyslipidemia and obesity in modern Mexicans. 	 22495753 21533023 24097068 16816950 22384356 24097064 20609967 23128226 16448983 23236364 23505323 19280764 20585729 20657596 23801825 15925009 20395969 23555291 22138821 22789990 15834862 15774484 21753830 22754564 17572673 20686565 23881580 17936576 22402612 20616382 21378990 23610370 18563960 16804065 21915269 16494531 19820697 20452521 15781255 21943158 21709689 16378771 11053704 11752295 21907010 22836069 21738485 17469398 14617512 22662228 21831376 20548291 17701901 22923468 23717430 17503322 23269371 19959603 23572411 11588264 12397357 22286219 23684009 19543373 23717210 2106931 12519949 12135615 15923542

24903457	Identification of a genetic variant at 2q12.1 associated with blood pressure in East Asians by genome-wide scan including gene-environment interactions.	Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic loci associated with blood pressure (BP). Genetic effects on BP can be altered by environmental exposures via multiple biological pathways. Especially, obesity is one of important environmental risk factors that can have considerable effect on BP and it may interact with genetic factors. Given that, we aimed to test whether genetic factors and obesity may jointly influence BP.	 16481885 21909115 14764635 10981041 22926246 15557390 22622230 16212839 11978627 19262484 19609347 18425821 17572673 21796221 21572416 18803820 21635879 20479774 21909109 19812666 20591971 19430483 18348202 19396169 19960030 23349798 19060910 12747893 14597836 20414254
24909733	TAOK3, a novel genome-wide association study locus associated with morphine requirement and postoperative pain in a retrospective pediatric day surgery population.	Candidate gene studies have revealed limited genetic bases for opioid analgesic response variability. Genome-wide association studies facilitate impartial queries of common genetic variants, allowing identification of novel genetic contributions to drug effect. Illumina (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to investigate SNP associations with total morphine requirement as a quantitative trait locus and with postoperative pain in a retrospective population of opioid-naïve children ages 4-18years who had undergone day surgery tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. In an independent replication cohort, significant genome-wide association studies-identified SNPs were assayed using TaqMan probes. Among 617 comprehensively phenotyped children, the 277 subjects of European Caucasian (EC) ancestry demonstrated nominal association between morphine dose and a series of novel SNPs (top rs795484, P=1.01 × 10(-6) and rs1277441, P=2.77 × 10(-6)) at the TAOK3 locus. Age, body mass index, and physical status were included covariates. Morphine requirement averaged 132.4 μg/kg (SD 40.9). Each minor allele at rs795484 (guanine [G]>adenine [A]) contributed +17.6 μg/kg (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-24.4) to dose. Effect direction and magnitude were replicated in an independent cohort of 75 EC children (P<0.05). No association with morphine dose was detected in African Americans (AA) (n=241). Postoperative pain scores ≥ 7/10 were associated with rs795484 (G>A) in the EC cohort (odds ratio 2.35, 95% CI 1.56-3.52, P<0.00005) and this association replicated in AA children (odds ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.71, P<0.01). Variants in TAOK3 encoding the serine/threonine-protein kinase, TAO3, are associated with increased morphine requirement in children of EC ancestry and with increased acute postoperative pain in both EC and AA subjects.	 23183491 21694509 21868358 21873412 22020140 22042410 22243964 22250276 10559204 10764185 10924369 16472919 16580900 16871067 16879459 16882820 17000822 17006062 17339873 17378023 17396146 17594295 17572673 17596221 17632545 17701901 18635471 18635502 18535201 18758442 19207018 19300499 19543373 19559388 19399514 19672167 19859063 20300088 20647212 20634204 20692097 20802051 21127278 21423693 21246217 20548291 20517342 22010099 22529273 22444188 23223113 11067846 11427329 11673751 12766651 13679851 15189164 15217304 15272312 1980537 8222493 9041568 9188108 9220806 9922370 15694871 15983468 16045647 23239825
24908248	Variants near TERT and TERC influencing telomere length are associated with high-grade glioma risk.	Glioma, the most common central nervous system cancer in adults, has poor prognosis. Here we identify a new SNP associated with glioma risk, rs1920116 (near TERC), that reached genome-wide significance (Pcombined = 8.3 × 10(-9)) in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of high-grade glioma and replication data (1,644 cases and 7,736 controls). This region has previously been associated with mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL). We therefore examined the relationship between LTL and both this new risk locus and other previously established risk loci for glioma using data from a recent GWAS of LTL (n = 37,684 individuals). Alleles associated with glioma risk near TERC and TERT were strongly associated with longer LTL (P = 5.5 × 10(-20) and 4.4 × 10(-19), respectively). In contrast, risk-associated alleles near RTEL1 were inconsistently associated with LTL, suggesting the presence of distinct causal alleles. No other risk loci for glioma were associated with LTL. The identification of risk alleles for glioma near TERC and TERT that also associate with telomere length implicates telomerase in gliomagenesis. 	 23936000 23733245 24115439 19543373 19578366 19578367 20139977 20418889 20702402 20972440 20981092 20517342 21467229 21531791 21695195 21946351 22064851 21708826 22269209 22532805 22539396 22955989 22922872 12000852 12193671 12514102 12958120 15520935 15965027 16862161 17043079 17223473 17554300 17684147 18411343 18348202 18772890 18762552 19129229 19269895 23280628 23348503 23348506 23535731 23535734 23530248 23583980 24039592
24919509	A genome-wide association study of serum levels of prostate-specific antigen in the Japanese population.	Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a useful marker for prostate cancer (PCa) and is widely used for screening of PCa. Previous studies have shown that genetic components influence the levels of PSA, and some of these genetic components would lead to better diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to PCa. However, genetic studies for PSA from Asian countries are limited. Our aim was to identify genetic components influencing PSA levels in the Japanese population using genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to analyse whether genetic components would lead to better screening abilities of PCa.	
24916648	A genome-wide association study identifies PLCL2 and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 as new susceptibility loci for myocardial infarction in Japanese.	Despite considerable progress in preventive and therapeutic strategies, myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. A total of 55 susceptibility genes have been identified mostly in European genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Nevertheless, large-scale GWAS from other population could possibly find additional susceptibility loci. To identify as many MI susceptibility loci as possible, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis in Japanese population. To identify MI susceptibility loci in Japanese, we conducted a GWAS using 1666 cases and 3198 controls using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip and HumanHap550v3 Genotyping BeadChip. We performed replication studies using a total of 11,412 cases and 28,397 controls in the Japanese population. Our study identified two novel susceptibility loci for MI: PLCL2 on chromosome 3p24.3 (rs4618210:A>G, P = 2.60 × 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 0.91) and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 on chromosome 19p13.3 (rs3803915:A>C, P = 3.84 × 10(-9), OR = 0.89). Besides, a total of 14 previously reported MI susceptibility loci were replicated in our study. In particular, we validated a strong association on chromosome 12q24 (rs3782886:A>G: P = 1.14 × 10(-14), OR = 1.46). Following pathway analysis using 265 genes related to MI or coronary artery disease, we found that these loci might be involved in the pathogenesis of MI via the promotion of atherosclerosis. In the present large-scale genomic analysis, we identified PLCL2 and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 as new susceptibility loci for MI in the Japanese population. Our findings will add novel findings for MI susceptibility loci.	 19198608 21372407 17194218 12123582 16934006 17982410 23248624 22286173 21829393 21971053 14517301 19302038 19715440 21572416 20686565 23202125 11782013 18852200 21378986 7634481 17620599 18817904 12626596 23263486 8211113 21058334 22751097 23077601 10581172 23470884 9697856 23041239 21399635 21833088 22797727 20798234 21107343

24925725	Lupus nephritis susceptibility loci in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.	Lupus nephritis is a manifestation of SLE resulting from glomerular immune complex deposition and inflammation. Lupus nephritis demonstrates familial aggregation and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. We completed a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies of SLE to identify lupus nephritis-predisposing loci. Through genotyping and imputation, >1.6 million markers were assessed in 2000 unrelated women of European descent with SLE (588 patients with lupus nephritis and 1412 patients with lupus without nephritis). Tests of association were computed using logistic regression adjusting for population substructure. The strongest evidence for association was observed outside the MHC and included markers localized to 4q11-q13 (PDGFRA, GSX2; P=4.5×10(-7)), 16p12 (SLC5A11; P=5.1×10(-7)), 6p22 (ID4; P=7.4×10(-7)), and 8q24.12 (HAS2, SNTB1; P=1.1×10(-6)). Both HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3, two well established lupus susceptibility loci, showed evidence of association with lupus nephritis (P=0.06 and P=3.7×10(-5), respectively). Within the class I region, rs9263871 (C6orf15-HCG22) had the strongest evidence of association with lupus nephritis independent of HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3 (P=8.5×10(-6)). Consistent with a functional role in lupus nephritis, intra-renal mRNA levels of PDGFRA and associated pathway members showed significant enrichment in patients with lupus nephritis (n=32) compared with controls (n=15). Results from this large-scale genome-wide investigation of lupus nephritis provide evidence of multiple biologically relevant lupus nephritis susceptibility loci.	 17065335 16998491 17804842 18204446 18204447 18204448 18204098 18606306 19074163 18940857 19165918 19493061 19851445 19838193 19838195 20169177 20080916 20616382 20659327 21194677 21408207 22123208 22004975 22291604 21597969 18069935 10607304 11786093 12115187 12215904 12424751 12428234 12631364 12651073 14730631 15273934 15307049 8040291 9057949 9159307 10352648 10461038 15840015 16320345 16688113 17572673
24920014	A meta-analysis of Hodgkin lymphoma reveals 19p13.3 TCF3 as a novel susceptibility locus.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have identified associations with genetic variation at both HLA and non-HLA loci; however, much of heritable HL susceptibility remains unexplained. Here we perform a meta-analysis of three HL GWAS totaling 1,816 cases and 7,877 controls followed by replication in an independent set of 1,281 cases and 3,218 controls to find novel risk loci. We identify a novel variant at 19p13.3 associated with HL (rs1860661; odds ratio (OR)=0.81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.76-0.86, P(combined) = 3.5 × 10(-10)), located in intron 2 of TCF3 (also known as E2A), a regulator of B- and T-cell lineage commitment known to be involved in HL pathogenesis. This meta-analysis also notes associations between previously published loci at 2p16, 5q31, 6p31, 8q24 and 10p14 and HL subtypes. We conclude that our data suggest a link between the 19p13.3 locus, including TCF3, and HL risk.	 22885699 22684628 18538592 18974171 23448259 18646185 16862161 21037568 17728769 23128226 21785431 15978930 22808081 15240668 17568781 18830131 17898773 12045153 16369535 17389336 17630352 22759852 22820512 3881158 15687363 20308568 17099321 17529973 22446964 22286212 16819547 7824015 1661073 14600123 21686124 15052270 21058334 17554300 19648918 16888011 18500343 16877363 831107 20634204 17701901 23218448 22086417 20702402 19364948 1303125 19525189 19543373 22955990
24927181	Genome-wide association study identifies three novel susceptibility loci for severe Acne vulgaris.	Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common inflammatory disorder of the cutaneous pilo-sebaceous unit. Here we perform a genome-wide association analysis in the United Kingdom, comparing severe cases of acne (n=1,893) with controls (n=5,132). In a second stage, we genotype putative-associated loci in a further 2,063 acne cases and 1,970 controls. We identify three genome-wide significant associations: 11q13.1 (rs478304, Pcombined=3.23 × 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 1.20), 5q11.2 (rs38055, P(combined) = 4.58 × 10(-9), OR = 1.17) and 1q41 (rs1159268, P(combined) = 4.08 × 10(-8), OR = 1.17). All three loci contain genes linked to the TGFβ cell signalling pathway, namely OVOL1, FST and TGFB2. Transcripts of OVOL1 and TFGB2 have decreased expression in affected compared with normal skin. Collectively, these data support a key role for dysregulation of TGFβ-mediated signalling in susceptibility to acne.

A genome-wide scan was performed for smoking×single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions on carotid plaque burden (CPB) to identify the potential genetic moderators in Hispanics.	 11486097 24202307 11602341 12704594 12851483 12920702 15145091 15132988 15326124 15210690 16020769 16862161 17132052 17701901 17482197 18354078 18706019 19091171 19762557 20379614 21311059 21558551 21909108 22462751 22319020 22550054 22789936 23239837 23148318 22878876 24068186 24180545 11535622
24929828	Genome-wide association analysis identifies six new loci associated with forced vital capacity.	Forced vital capacity (FVC), a spirometric measure of pulmonary function, reflects lung volume and is used to diagnose and monitor lung diseases. We performed genome-wide association study meta-analysis of FVC in 52,253 individuals from 26 studies and followed up the top associations in 32,917 additional individuals of European ancestry. We found six new regions associated at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with FVC in or near EFEMP1, BMP6, MIR129-2-HSD17B12, PRDM11, WWOX and KCNJ2. Two loci previously associated with spirometric measures (GSTCD and PTCH1) were related to FVC. Newly implicated regions were followed up in samples from African-American, Korean, Chinese and Hispanic individuals. We detected transcripts for all six newly implicated genes in human lung tissue. The new loci may inform mechanisms involved in lung development and the pathogenesis of restrictive lung disease. 	 17873877 19200528 20980245 21347282 21471066 21276135 17254419 17572673 21699702 21233268 21877163 21946350 22426310 22916109 22955989 23284291 23218411 23715323 23890215 24068893 24013639 10861898 11315092 11371421 11401066 11678987 11719305 12151307 12537866 14997420 1094879 6823813 2213076 9847291 16077740 16478991 17676998 19300500 19396169 19557161 19644074 19815808 20010834 20010835 20037613 19840957 20303063 20479774 20485568 20400780 20435672 20562874 20616382 20881960 20981092 20562119 21058334 21139605 21102462
24940741	A genome-wide association study on chronic HBV infection and its clinical progression in male Han-Taiwanese.	It is common to observe the clustering of chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers in families. Intra-familial transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) could be the reason for the familial clustering of HBsAg carriers. Additionally, genetic and gender factors have been reported to be involved. We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with chronic HBV susceptibility. A total of 1,065 male controls and 1,623 male HBsAg carriers were included. The whole-genome genotyping was done on Illumina HumanHap550 beadchips in 304 healthy controls and HumanHap610 beadchips in 321 cases. We found that rs9277535 (HLA-DPB1, P = 4.87×10(-14)), rs9276370 (HLA-DQA2, P = 1.9×10(-12)), rs7756516 and rs7453920 (HLA-DQB2, P = 1.48×10(-11) and P = 6.66×10(-15) respectively) were significantly associated with persistent HBV infection. A novel SNP rs9366816 near HLA-DPA3 also showed significant association (P = 2.58×10(-10)). The "T-T-G-G-T" haplotype of the five SNPs further signified their association with the disease (P = 1.48×10(-12); OR = 1.49). The "T-T" haplotype composed of rs7756516 and rs9276370 was more prevalent in severe disease subgroups and associated with non-sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0262). The "G-C" haplotype was associated with sustained therapeutic response (P = 0.0132; OR = 2.49). We confirmed that HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 loci were associated with persistent HBV infection in male Taiwan Han-Chinese. In addition, the HLA-DQA2 and -DQB2 complex was associated with clinical progression and therapeutic response.	 20683932 14519756 21750111 24465366 15030982 17465466 12100614 11526545 10452889 24282030 3209993 22045673 18380625 19349983 23744454 15470215 17716353 16172101 15297300 21408128 16534213 22496224 10082431 7995980 2360240 7108271 24162738 19403005 20197760 10586900 196971 23798667 19669255 21346778 19378345
24939585	Genome-wide association analysis demonstrates the highly polygenic character of age-related hearing impairment.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genes responsible for age-related hearing impairment (ARHI), the most common form of hearing impairment in the elderly. Analysis of common variants, with and without adjustment for stratification and environmental covariates, rare variants and interactions, as well as gene-set enrichment analysis, showed no variants with genome-wide significance. No evidence for replication of any previously reported genes was found. A study of the genetic architecture indicates for the first time that ARHI is highly polygenic in nature, with probably no major genes involved. The phenotype depends on the aggregated effect of a large number of SNPs, of which the individual effects are undetectable in a modestly powered GWAS. We estimated that 22% of the variance in our data set can be explained by the collective effect of all genotyped SNPs. A score analysis showed a modest enrichment in causative SNPs among the SNPs with a P-value below 0.01. 	 10349630 16182900 16466104 17572673 17921507 18543032 19047183 19571811 20068591 20464410 20562875 20881960 21167468 21493956 21737059 22767386 23102807 1636419 12040185
24938310	Novel common variants and susceptible haplotype for exfoliation glaucoma specific to Asian population.	The common variants in lysyl oxidase-like 1 gene (LOXL1) are associated with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) patients developed through exfoliation syndrome (XFS). However, the risk allele of a variant in LOXL1 has been found to be inverted between Asian and Caucasian populations. Therefore, we newly performed a genome-wide association study using 201 XFS/XFG and 697 controls in Japanese, and identified 34 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributing in not only LOXL1 but also TBC1D21 and PML at the 15q24.1 locus. These SNPs were confirmed by an independent population consisted of 121 XFS/XFG and 263 controls in Japanese. Moreover, further analyses revealed a unique haplotype structure only from the combination of TBC1D21 and LOXL1 variants showing a high XFS/XFG susceptibility specific for the Asian population. Although there still should be other gene(s) in the other region(s) contributing to the disease process, these results suggested that the combination of newly discovered variants in these genes might be useful for precise XFG risk assessment, as well as for elucidating the molecular mechanism of XFG pathogenesis through XFS. 	 21250943 20947153 21045241 16488940 17943122 15761122 20966922 19279343 18334928 18636115 10806494 18036875 19240540 18552979 18254956 18809397 20354512 18201684 17690259 19503743 18385063 19625618 19936304 13655060 18648524 19561590 18483563 15350316 22428042 20431720 16936732 18450598
24941225	Genetic variations affecting serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and status of regional lymph nodes in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer from Southern China.	Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (sCEA) level might be an indicator of disease. Indeed, an elevated sCEA level is a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, the genetic determinants of sCEA level in healthy and CRC population remains unclear. Thus we investigated the genetic markers associated with elevated serum sCEA level in these two populations and its clinical implications.	 17170030 21875276 6538497 18604267 2751016 19192421 6160390 11488795 23300138 7226508 22162235 18394347 8841002 22200039 56468 3510056 11306451 20729339 20729287 1330929 17316412 361200 8223061 11437401 11396194 7790122 9166289 20126873 15292968 15698733 16682732 20889724 16260700 7585642 15286738 11106680 17470851 14684825 15150609 22547830 20937632 9294507 11898035 22505654 21642686 20375642 7279704 22367966 9463746 17687149 4758660 10490103 91070 2141511 15655602 21301835 11058588 22137981 18026187 21337313 6118576 4859499 8621666 9120872 18083404 11896570
25043022	A common Greenlandic TBC1D4 variant confers muscle insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.	The Greenlandic population, a small and historically isolated founder population comprising about 57,000 inhabitants, has experienced a dramatic increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence during the past 25 years. Motivated by this, we performed association mapping of T2D-related quantitative traits in up to 2,575 Greenlandic individuals without known diabetes. Using array-based genotyping and exome sequencing, we discovered a nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant (in which arginine is replaced by a termination codon) in the gene TBC1D4 with an allele frequency of 17%. Here we show that homozygous carriers of this variant have markedly higher concentrations of plasma glucose (β = 3.8 mmol l(-1), P = 2.5 × 10(-35)) and serum insulin (β = 165 pmol l(-1), P = 1.5 × 10(-20)) 2 hours after an oral glucose load compared with individuals with other genotypes (both non-carriers and heterozygous carriers). Furthermore, homozygous carriers have marginally lower concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (β = -0.18 mmol l(-1), P = 1.1 × 10(-6)) and fasting serum insulin (β = -8.3 pmol l(-1), P = 0.0014), and their T2D risk is markedly increased (odds ratio (OR) = 10.3, P = 1.6 × 10(-24)). Heterozygous carriers have a moderately higher plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose load than non-carriers (β = 0.43 mmol l(-1), P = 5.3 × 10(-5)). Analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies showed lower messenger RNA and protein levels of the long isoform of TBC1D4, and lower muscle protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4, with increasing number of p.Arg684Ter alleles. These findings are concomitant with a severely decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and T2D. The observed effect sizes are several times larger than any previous findings in large-scale genome-wide association studies of these traits and constitute further proof of the value of conducting genetic association studies outside the traditional setting of large homogeneous populations. 	 21964575 22876189 20573752 21903627 14663300 12351475 20644199 23656981 24290377 19200528 23160641 18771725 23078342 22581228 22885924 12637568 24215025 15052271 20981092 19451168 19252894 19648217 19470471 22885922 10741566 22706312 14527126 3899825
24945404	Phenotypic dissection of bone mineral density reveals skeletal site specificity and facilitates the identification of novel loci in the genetic regulation of bone mass attainment.	Heritability of bone mineral density (BMD) varies across skeletal sites, reflecting different relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences. To quantify the degree to which common genetic variants tag and environmental factors influence BMD, at different sites, we estimated the genetic (rg) and residual (re) correlations between BMD measured at the upper limbs (UL-BMD), lower limbs (LL-BMD) and skull (SK-BMD), using total-body DXA scans of ∼ 4,890 participants recruited by the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and their Children (ALSPAC). Point estimates of rg indicated that appendicular sites have a greater proportion of shared genetic architecture (LL-/UL-BMD rg = 0.78) between them, than with the skull (UL-/SK-BMD rg = 0.58 and LL-/SK-BMD rg = 0.43). Likewise, the residual correlation between BMD at appendicular sites (r(e) = 0.55) was higher than the residual correlation between SK-BMD and BMD at appendicular sites (r(e) = 0.20-0.24). To explore the basis for the observed differences in rg and re, genome-wide association meta-analyses were performed (n ∼ 9,395), combining data from ALSPAC and the Generation R Study identifying 15 independent signals from 13 loci associated at genome-wide significant level across different skeletal regions. Results suggested that previously identified BMD-associated variants may exert site-specific effects (i.e. differ in the strength of their association and magnitude of effect across different skeletal sites). In particular, variants at CPED1 exerted a larger influence on SK-BMD and UL-BMD when compared to LL-BMD (P = 2.01 × 10(-37)), whilst variants at WNT16 influenced UL-BMD to a greater degree when compared to SK- and LL-BMD (P = 2.31 × 10(-14)). In addition, we report a novel association between RIN3 (previously associated with Paget's disease) and LL-BMD (rs754388: β = 0.13, SE = 0.02, P = 1.4 × 10(-10)). Our results suggest that BMD at different skeletal sites is under a mixture of shared and specific genetic and environmental influences. Allowing for these differences by performing genome-wide association at different skeletal sites may help uncover new genetic influences on BMD.	 8093403 22955989 18974171 18445777 22792070 22504420 21816040 21638316 21452281 21623375 21283786 14685227 12824425 11771662 9467541 9312398 17943122 17701901 17002557 16939408 16862161 16734383 16331359 13539104 23644456 22507743 23437003 23074152 23086283 22843982 19181680 19261174 19652039 19715440 19700477 19801982 19654370 20167110 20616382 20634204 21030618 21058334 21167468 14995047 14997420 3351908
24954895	Gene-age interactions in blood pressure regulation: a large-scale investigation with the CHARGE, Global BPgen, and ICBP Consortia.	Although age-dependent effects on blood pressure (BP) have been reported, they have not been systematically investigated in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We leveraged the infrastructure of three well-established consortia (CHARGE, GBPgen, and ICBP) and a nonstandard approach (age stratification and metaregression) to conduct a genome-wide search of common variants with age-dependent effects on systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean arterial (MAP), and pulse (PP) pressure. In a two-staged design using 99,241 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 20 genome-wide significant (p ≤ 5 × 10(-8)) loci by using joint tests of the SNP main effect and SNP-age interaction. Nine of the significant loci demonstrated nominal evidence of age-dependent effects on BP by tests of the interactions alone. Index SNPs in the EHBP1L1 (DBP and MAP), CASZ1 (SBP and MAP), and GOSR2 (PP) loci exhibited the largest age interactions, with opposite directions of effect in the young versus the old. The changes in the genetic effects over time were small but nonnegligible (up to 1.58 mm Hg over 60 years). The EHBP1L1 locus was discovered through gene-age interactions only in whites but had DBP main effects replicated (p = 8.3 × 10(-4)) in 8,682 Asians from Singapore, indicating potential interethnic heterogeneity. A secondary analysis revealed 22 loci with evidence of age-specific effects (e.g., only in 20 to 29-year-olds). Age can be used to select samples with larger genetic effect sizes and more homogenous phenotypes, which may increase statistical power. Age-dependent effects identified through novel statistical approaches can provide insight into the biology and temporal regulation underlying BP associations.	 21909115 21252912 24658283 21490919 22854640 11304504 24136929 24473254 24662972 23873611 9158560 24202307 23192594 21796221 21572416 474567 22960999 19430479 3770866 6323074 21909110 12574083 18466776 22028671 20616382 19029486 24289273 22499900 16152135 21102463 23893921 21300955 18587394 11288809 20479155 20031577 19421330 24516586 20708005 19430483 21378095 20634204 21527745 18387595 8225539 20031576 24281739 23114982 22321768 21308768 16027244 9236450 19933162 24376456
24950379	Variants close to NTRK2 gene are associated with birth weight in female twins.	Low weight at birth has previously been shown to be associated with a number of adult diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and obesity later in life. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published for singleton-born individuals, but the role of genetic variation in birth weight (BW) in twins has not yet been fully investigated. A GWAS was performed in 4,593 female study participants with BW data available from the TwinsUK cohort. A genome-wide significant signal was found in chromosome 9, close to the NTRK2 gene (OMIM: 600456). QIMR, an Australian twin cohort (n = 3,003), and UK-based singleton-birth individuals from the Hertfordshire cohort (n = 2,997) were used as replication for the top two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) underpinning this signal, rs12340987 and rs7849941. The top SNP, rs12340987, was found to be in the same direction in the Australian twins and in the singleton-born females (fixed effects meta-analysis beta = -0.13, SE = 0.02, and p = 1.48 × 10-8) but not in the singleton-born males tested. These findings provide an important insight into the genetic component of BW in twins who are normally excluded due to their lower BW when compared with singleton births, as well as the difference in BW between twins. The NTRK2 gene identified in this study has previously been associated with obesity. 	
24951543	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in multiethnic Asians identifies two loci for age-related nuclear cataract.	Age-related cataract is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, especially in developing countries where access to cataract surgery remains limited. Previous linkage and candidate gene studies suggested genetic influences on age-related nuclear cataract but few genetic markers have been identified thus far. We conducted genome-wide association studies on 4569 Asians (including 2369 Malays and 2200 Indians), and replicated our analysis in 2481 Chinese from two independent cohorts (1768 Chinese in Singapore and 803 Chinese in Beijing). We confirmed two genome-wide significant loci for nuclear cataract in the combined meta-analysis of four cohorts (n = 7140). The first locus was at chromosome 3q25.31 in KCNAB1 (rs7615568, fixed-effect Pmeta = 2.30 × 10(-8); random-effect Pmeta = 1.08 × 10(-8)). The second locus was at chromosome 21 in the proximity of CRYAA (rs11911275, fixed-effect Pmeta = 2.77 × 10(-8); random-effect Pmeta = 1.98 × 10(-9)), a major protein component of eye lens. The findings were further supported by up-regulation and down-regulation of KCNAB1 and CRYAA in human lens capsule, respectively, as the severity of nuclear cataract increases. The results offer additional insights into the pathogenesis of nuclear cataract in Asians. 	
24957906	A genome-wide association study identifies a functional ERAP2 haplotype associated with birdshot chorioretinopathy.	Birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR) is a rare form of autoimmune uveitis that can lead to severe visual impairment. Intriguingly, >95% of cases carry the HLA-A29 allele, which defines the strongest documented HLA association for a human disease. We have conducted a genome-wide association study in 96 Dutch and 27 Spanish cases, and 398 unrelated Dutch and 380 Spanish controls. Fine-mapping the primary MHC association through high-resolution imputation at classical HLA loci, identified HLA-A*29:02 as the principal MHC association (odds ratio (OR) = 157.5, 95% CI 91.6-272.6, P = 6.6 × 10(-74)). We also identified two novel susceptibility loci at 5q15 near ERAP2 (rs7705093; OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.7-3.1, for the T allele, P = 8.6 × 10(-8)) and at 14q32.31 in the TECPR2 gene (rs150571175; OR = 6.1, 95% CI 3.2-11.7, for the A allele, P = 3.2 × 10(-8)). The association near ERAP2 was confirmed in an independent British case-control samples (combined meta-analysis P = 1.7 × 10(-9)). Functional analyses revealed that the risk allele of the polymorphism near ERAP2 is strongly associated with high mRNA and protein expression of ERAP2 in B cells. This study further defined an extremely strong MHC risk component in BSCR, and detected evidence for a novel disease mechanism that affects peptide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. 	 20953190 16155052 21297633 21570674 21743469 21833088 22532805 22574188 22561518 22820512 22941192 23176824 23521856 17525752 17554261 17701901 18214792 18512248 19140825 19498108 19570815 19838193 19925418 20062062 20084006 20397748 20453842 20562859 20531381 20686565 19430480 20881960 20864672 20976248 23603761 23762245 23749187 23622563 23870125 24248368 23714750 11567636 12434483 15488792 6956239 3341436 2184120 8449029 8534662 15908954 16263368 16386995 21102463
24952745	Genetic association study of QT interval highlights role for calcium signaling pathways in myocardial repolarization.	The QT interval, an electrocardiographic measure reflecting myocardial repolarization, is a heritable trait. QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could indicate the presence of the potentially lethal mendelian long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Using a genome-wide association and replication study in up to 100,000 individuals, we identified 35 common variant loci associated with QT interval that collectively explain ∼8-10% of QT-interval variation and highlight the importance of calcium regulation in myocardial repolarization. Rare variant analysis of 6 new QT interval-associated loci in 298 unrelated probands with LQTS identified coding variants not found in controls but of uncertain causality and therefore requiring validation. Several newly identified loci encode proteins that physically interact with other recognized repolarization proteins. Our integration of common variant association, expression and orthogonal protein-protein interaction screens provides new insights into cardiac electrophysiology and identifies new candidate genes for ventricular arrhythmias, LQTS and SCD. 	 23583979 23734001 23878236 18974357 18929333 24196873 19118385 19305408 19305409 19587794 19502553 20062060 20062063 20081858 20075334 20694148 20657582 20714348 20616382 20944595 21076409 21102462 21249183 21441907 21552263 21406682 21511878 21829377 21963258 22001757 22327339 22075452 22726844 22876189 10970890 11161216 14966518 15454265 8339437 10080178 15569689 15823540 15851319 15863612 16648850 16899508 17344885 18006473 18348202 22895603 23166209
24963161	CMPK1 and RBP3 are associated with corneal curvature in Asian populations.	Corneal curvature (CC) measures the steepness of the cornea and is an important parameter for clinically diseases such as astigmatism and myopia. Despite the high heritability of CC, only two associated genes have been discovered to date. We performed a three-stage genome-wide association study meta-analysis in 12 660 Asian individuals. Our Stage 1 was done in multiethnic cohorts comprising 7440 individuals, followed by a Stage 2 replication in 2473 Chinese and Stage 3 in 2747 Japanese. The SNP array genotype data were imputed up to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 cosmopolitan panel. The SNP association with the radii of CC was investigated in the linear regression model with the adjustment of age, gender and principal components. In addition to the known genes, MTOR (also known as FRAP1) and PDGFRA, we discovered two novel genes associated with CC: CMPK1 (rs17103186, P = 3.3 × 10(-12)) and RBP3 (rs11204213 [Val884Met], P = 1.1 × 10(-13)). The missense RBP3 SNP, rs11204213, was also associated with axial length (AL) (P = 4.2 × 10(-6)) and had larger effects on both CC and AL compared with other SNPs. The index SNPs at the four indicated loci explained 1.9% of CC variance across the Stages 1 and 2 cohorts, while 33.8% of CC variance was explained by the genome-wide imputation data. We identified two novel genes influencing CC, which are related to either corneal shape or eye size. This study provides additional insights into genetic architecture of corneal shape. 	
24964207	Genetic relationships between suicide attempts, suicidal ideation and major psychiatric disorders: a genome-wide association and polygenic scoring study.	Epidemiological studies have recognized a genetic diathesis for suicidal behavior, which is independent of other psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on suicide attempt (SA) and ideation have failed to identify specific genetic variants. Here, we conduct further GWAS and for the first time, use polygenic score analysis in cohorts of patients with mood disorders, to test for common genetic variants for mood disorders and suicide phenotypes. Genome-wide studies for SA were conducted in the RADIANT and GSK-Munich recurrent depression samples and London Bipolar Affective Disorder Case-Control Study (BACCs) then meta-analysis was performed. A GWAS on suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment had previously been conducted in the Genome Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study. We derived polygenic scores from each sample and tested their ability to predict SA in the mood disorder cohorts or ideation status in the GENDEP study. Polygenic scores for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were used to investigate pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and suicide phenotypes. No significant evidence for association was detected at any SNP in GWAS or meta-analysis. Polygenic scores for major depressive disorder significantly predicted suicidal ideation in the GENDEP pharmacogenetics study and also predicted SA in a combined validation dataset. Polygenic scores for SA showed no predictive ability for suicidal ideation. Polygenic score analysis suggests pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation whereas the tendency to act on such thoughts may have a partially independent genetic diathesis.	 23245609 19571811 23555274 23657481 22059935 24339138 11532534 19089808 19724244 19832967 19879845 20360315 19107115 20516156 20886545 21041247 21750702 21926972 21926974 21722920 20877300 21423239 11754464 11843783 12499305 12645823 15166638 444788 4021024 2190539 1883262 8678168 8956681 9504698 9989552 13688369 14399272 15588307 15893115 16395305 17046723 17701901 17721766 17785532 18300295 19120044 19181679 22472876

24974847	A three-stage genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for late radiotherapy toxicity at 2q24.1.	There is increasing evidence supporting the role of genetic variants in the development of radiation-induced toxicity. However, previous candidate gene association studies failed to elucidate the common genetic variation underlying this phenotype, which could emerge years after the completion of treatment. We performed a genome-wide association study on a Spanish cohort of 741 individuals with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The replication cohorts consisted of 633 cases from the UK and 368 cases from North America. One locus comprising TANC1 (lowest unadjusted P value for overall late toxicity=6.85×10(-9), odds ratio (OR)=6.61, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.23-19.63) was replicated in the second stage (lowest unadjusted P value for overall late toxicity=2.08×10(-4), OR=6.17, 95% CI=2.25-16.95; Pcombined=4.16×10(-10)). The inclusion of the third cohort gave unadjusted Pcombined=4.64×10(-11). These results, together with the role of TANC1 in regenerating damaged muscle, suggest that the TANC1 locus influences the development of late radiation-induced damage.	 22532805 23021708 22385796 21526222 23993398 23075580 23245646 22384356 24210251 20338472 23128226 21605943 22138821 22169269 10717093 23199655 22767148 19715440 22169268 23719583 21470834 12029063 11748142 22274696 20932654 16415888 23376709 21861849 12903009 15297300 23642504 24785509 20817285 19682889 17482880 18287387 17701901 1917622 22652106 22182840 20702402 19543373
24980573	Identification of a melanoma susceptibility locus and somatic mutation in TET2.	Although genetic studies have reported a number of loci associated with melanoma risk, the complex genetic architecture of the disease is not yet fully understood. We sought to identify common genetic variants associated with melanoma risk in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2298 cases and 6654 controls. Thirteen of 15 known loci were replicated with nominal significance. A total of 69 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for in silico replication in two independent melanoma GWAS datasets (a total of 5149 cases and 12 795 controls). Seven novel loci were nominally significantly associated with melanoma risk. These seven SNPs were further genotyped in 234 melanoma cases and 238 controls. The SNP rs4698934 was nominally significantly associated with melanoma risk. The combined odds ratio per T allele = 1.18; 95% confidence interval (1.10-1.25); combined P = 7.70 × 10(-) (7). This SNP is located in the intron of the TET2 gene on chromosome 4q24. In addition, a novel somatic mutation of TET2 was identified by next-generation sequencing in 1 of 22 sporadic melanoma cases. TET2 encodes a member of TET family enzymes that oxidizes 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). It is a putative epigenetic biomarker of melanoma as we previously reported, with observation of reduced TET2 transcriptional expression. This study is the first to implicate TET2 genetic variation and mutation in melanoma. 	 23458759 23534428 19617292 18547303 21478494 24390216 18488026 19420352 18849993 21926416 21700618 20018042 19863770 21116649 23671639 19578365 23716660 21983787 12789279 19710684 23743927 24169492 21896958 19578364 19151717 20639862 16759158 18488027 24122999 19585149 21983785 15617989 16125929 21296855 22980977 19564637 22234893

24962563	Genome-wide genetic and transcriptomic investigation of variation in antibody response to dietary antigens.	Increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to dietary antigens can be associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction and autoimmunity. The underlying processes contributing to these adverse reactions remain largely unknown, and it is likely that genetic factors play a role. Here, we estimate heritability and attempt to localize genetic factors influencing IgG antibody levels against food-derived antigens using an integrative genomics approach. IgG antibody levels were determined by ELISA in >1,300 Mexican Americans for the following food antigens: wheat gliadin; bovine casein; and two forms of bovine serum albumin (BSA-a and BSA-b). Pedigree-based variance components methods were used to estimate additive genetic heritability (h(2) ), perform genome-wide association analyses, and identify transcriptional signatures (based on 19,858 transcripts from peripheral blood lymphocytes). Heritability estimates were significant for all traits (0.15-0.53), and shared environment (based on shared residency among study participants) was significant for casein (0.09) and BSA-a (0.33). Genome-wide significant evidence of association was obtained only for antibody to gliadin (P = 8.57 × 10(-8) ), mapping to the human leukocyte antigen II region, with HLA-DRA and BTNL2 as the best candidate genes. Lack of association of known celiac disease risk alleles HLA-DQ2.5 and -DQ8 with antigliadin antibodies in the studied population suggests a separate genetic etiology. Significant transcriptional signatures were found for all IgG levels except BSA-b. These results demonstrate that individual genetic differences contribute to food antigen antibody measures in this population. Further investigations may elucidate the underlying immunological processes involved. 	 17629515 12897754 16862161 21211944 19748229 921216 22322673 11791215 18208460 10452762 22592522 20190752 8901667 16354797 23083989 18255352 19302247 18589004 23199605 2909659 21737039 9515587 3772018 20228799 3953676 19851108 11731797 9545414 12694579 15753919 17873875 21489610 18209506 21376538 6859102 22117664 16080124 22057235 23326239 12578508 19016802 21298027 18509540 15020763 6426451 19435515
24986923	A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci of silica-related pneumoconiosis in Han Chinese.	Pneumoconiosis is the most serious occupational disease in China and its leading cause is occupational silica exposure. Pneumoconiosis takes several years to develop depending on the exposure level of silica. However, individual variation in the susceptibility to pneumoconiosis has been observed among the subjects with similar exposure. We conducted a genome-wide screening with 710,999 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cohort of 400 coal workers (202 cases and 198 exposed controls) for pneumoconiosis susceptible loci. Seven promising variants were evaluated in an independent cohort of 568 coal workers (323 cases and 245 exposed controls), followed by a second replication on 463 iron ore workers (167 cases and 296 exposed controls). By pooling all of the genome-wide association studies and replication stages together, we found a genome-wide significant (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) association for rs73329476 (P = 1.74 × 10(-8), OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.66-2.85) and two additional replicated associations for rs4320486 (P < 0.05) and rs117626015 (P < 0.05) with combined P-values of 4.29 × 10(-6) and 5.05 × 10(-6), respectively. In addition, the risk allele T of rs73329476 was significantly associated with lower mRNA expression levels of carboxypeptidase M (CPM) in total cellular RNA from whole blood of 156 healthy individuals (P = 0.0252). The identified pneumoconiosis susceptibility loci may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis, and may also have some clinical utility for risk prediction for pneumoconiosis and high-risk population screening for workers with occupational silica exposure.	
24993907	Common genes underlying asthma and COPD? Genome-wide analysis on the Dutch hypothesis.	Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are thought to share a genetic background ("Dutch hypothesis"). We investigated whether asthma and COPD have common underlying genetic factors, performing genome-wide association studies for both asthma and COPD and combining the results in meta-analyses. Three loci showed potential involvement in both diseases: chr2p24.3, chr5q23.1 and chr13q14.2, containing DDX1, COMMD10 (both participating in the nuclear factor (NF) κβ pathway) and GNG5P5, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs9534578 in GNG5P5 reached genome-wide significance after first replication phase (p=9.96×10(-9)). The second replication phase, in seven independent cohorts, provided no significant replication. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis in blood cells and lung tissue on the top 20 associated SNPs identified two SNPs in COMMD10 that influenced gene expression. Inflammatory processes differ in asthma and COPD and are mediated by NF-κβ, which could be driven by the same underlying genes, COMMD10 and DDX1. None of the SNPs reached genome-wide significance. Our eQTL studies support a functional role for two COMMD10 SNPs, since they influence gene expression in both blood cells and lung tissue. Our findings suggest that there is either no common genetic component in asthma and COPD or, alternatively, different environmental factors, e.g. lifestyle and occupation in different countries and continents, which may have obscured the genetic common contribution. 	 12668795 12421542 12740290 12925520 15080825 15144468 7666875 9090385 9371819 15516465 15611928 15799966 15879414 16267171 16484677 16864716 16864717 17000751 17131307 18462017 18613948 19058135 18831683 19608716 19862934 19933216 20577206 20860503 20709820 21365793 21297068 21829388 21861260 21436250 21946350 21951550 22112999 22805464 23209423 23886569 15941840 11349227 11912176 11914989 12110844 12719384

Twelve SNPs, distributed across four regions (3p21.31, 4q27, 6q15, 6q25), were significantly associated with disease (p-value <1.0×10-7), and a further seven SNPs, across four additional regions (1q24.3, 10p15.1, 6q22.31, 17q21.32) had suggestive evidence (1.0×10-7 < p-value < 1.0×10-6). This study replicated a previous suggestive association within FRMD4B (3p14.1), confirming it as a celiac disease locus. All four regions with significant associations and two regions with suggestive results (1q24.3, 10p15.1) were known disease loci. The 6q22.31 and 10p11.23 regions were not replicated. A total of 410 SNPs distributed across the eight significant and suggestive regions were tested for association with dermatitis herpetiformis and microscopic colitis. Preliminary, suggestive statistical evidence for association with the two traits was found at chromosomes 3p21.31, 6q15, 6q25, 1q24.3 and 10p11.23, with future studies being required to validate the reported associations. 	 12578508 24442442 4114064 4117835 6192959 16292086 16534212 17384015 17558408 18334870 18311140 19648293 19631283 20190752 20848509 21364545 21054494 21471570 22057235 22261526 22778763 22592522 22850429 22543157 23328432 15017513
25003214	The correlation between reading and mathematics ability at age twelve has a substantial genetic component.	Dissecting how genetic and environmental influences impact on learning is helpful for maximizing numeracy and literacy. Here we show, using twin and genome-wide analysis, that there is a substantial genetic component to children's ability in reading and mathematics, and estimate that around one half of the observed correlation in these traits is due to shared genetic effects (so-called Generalist Genes). Thus, our results highlight the potential role of the learning environment in contributing to differences in a child's cognitive abilities at age twelve. 	 9256582 22507743 21457949 16060804 22384356 20013306 22223662 20423976 12573187 23258944 17846035 19915572 10946751 20881960 12415317 15819646 22258510 16278297 22821350 9445412 22057162 17995572 17684495 21881542 23110994 16354500 16122059 21142928 20068590 11731797 21826061 23722424 7939663 17554300 15493463 17708696 21167468 21757498 20039944 23599478 22902788 23738518 19543373 9398838 23640065
25044411	Genome-wide association and network analysis of lung function in the Framingham Heart Study.	Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been found to be associated with pulmonary function using genome-wide association studies. However, lung function is a complex trait that is likely to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions besides individual genes. Our goal is to build a cellular network to explore the relationship between pulmonary function and genotypes by combining SNP level and network analyses using longitudinal lung function data from the Framingham Heart Study. We analyzed 2,698 genotyped participants from the Offspring cohort that had an average of 3.35 spirometry measurements per person for a mean length of 13 years. Repeated forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 ) and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) were used as outcomes. Data were analyzed using linear-mixed models for the association between lung function and alleles by accounting for the correlation among repeated measures over time within the same subject and within-family correlation. Network analyses were performed using dmGWAS and validated with data from the Third Generation cohort. Analyses identified SMAD3, TGFBR2, CD44, CTGF, VCAN, CTNNB1, SCGB1A1, PDE4D, NRG1, EPHB1, and LYN as contributors to pulmonary function. Most of these genes were novel that were not found previously using solely SNP-level analysis. These novel genes are involving the transforming growth factor beta (TGFB)-SMAD pathway, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, etc. Therefore, combining SNP-level and network analyses using longitudinal lung function data is a useful alternative strategy to identify risk genes. 	 10861898 23144326 1208363 7663792 9603122 15802338 16227324 16393673 16755536 16707515 16737987 17016624 17132052 18252216 18485243 19079255 19741265 19277065 19703829 20463300 21045073 21625484 21980461 22935211 15469929

25017104	Genome-wide association analysis of eosinophilic esophagitis provides insight into the tissue specificity of this allergic disease.	Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with allergic hypersensitivity to food. We interrogated >1.5 million genetic variants in EoE cases of European ancestry and subsequently in a multi-site cohort with local and out-of-study control subjects. In addition to replicating association of the 5q22 locus (meta-analysis P=1.9×10(-16)), we identified an association at 2p23 spanning CAPN14 (P=2.5×10(-10)). CAPN14 was specifically expressed in the esophagus, was dynamically upregulated as a function of disease activity and genetic haplotype and after exposure of epithelial cells to interleukin (IL)-13, and was located in an epigenetic hotspot modified by IL-13. Genes neighboring the top 208 EoE-associated sequence variants were enriched for esophageal expression, and multiple loci for allergic sensitization were associated with EoE susceptibility (4.8×10(-2)<P<5.1×10(-11)). We propose a model to explain the tissue-specific nature of EoE that involves the interplay of allergic sensitization with an EoE-specific, IL-13-inducible esophageal response involving CAPN14.	 23557745 22955612 23817569 23817571 24412366 24467364 24920534 11037894 12761043 12813022 16453027 16607617 16718709 17572673 17701901 18299526 22955614 22962707 22673732 23042114 23203987 23374260 21204801 23557262 19463222 19261174 19596270 19651619 19571233 19596009 23884466 19919682 20208004 20208534 20436464 20543112 20620568 20639775 20811451 20610477 20634204 21177656 21470243 21670566 18434257 18587394 18798982 19285864 19289445 19349982 19349984 21617960 21477849 19429794 21907864 22036096 22150418 22034864 22197932 22545103 22541246 22935588
25023989	A novel colorectal cancer risk locus at 4q32.2 identified from an international genome-wide association study.	Only a fraction of colorectal cancer heritability is explained by known risk-conferring genetic variation. This study was designed to identify novel risk alleles in Europeans. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of colorectal cancer in participants from a population-based case-control study in Israel (n = 1616 cases, 1329 controls) and a consortium study from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (n = 1977 cases, 999 controls). We used a two-stage (discovery-replication) GWAS design, followed by a joint meta-analysis. A combined analysis identified a novel susceptibility locus that reached genome-wide significance on chromosome 4q32.2 [rs35509282, risk allele = A (minor allele frequency = 0.09); odds ratio (OR) per risk allele = 1.53; P value = 8.2 × 10(-9); nearest gene = FSTL5]. The direction of the association was consistent across studies. In addition, we confirmed that 14 of 29 previously identified susceptibility variants were significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer in this study. Genetic variation on chromosome 4q32.2 is significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer in Ashkenazi Jews and Europeans in this study. 	 23570467 16862161 18084292 21655089 23628597 20517689 17982118 18974144 21037809 22527283 17630503 21976543 18753146 18509313 11197253 16136653 22138821 18300295 22634755 15917383 22820512 22955616 19434079 15710986 14973550 19011631 20616382 16415888 23266556 21090969 15358723 23300701 18622647 23166528 19812666 20972440 17618283 17618284 21678065 20634204 23535734 17701901 11057902 21761138 19369660 19043597 20981092 18372905 17934461 22243964 22251874 18372901 17613544 21357381
25027320	SUCLG2 identified as both a determinator of CSF Aβ1-42 levels and an attenuator of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.	Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated Tau at position 181 (pTau181) are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed an analysis and meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data on Aβ1-42 and pTau181 in AD dementia patients followed by independent replication. An association was found between Aβ1-42 level and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in SUCLG2 (rs62256378) (P = 2.5×10(-12)). An interaction between APOE genotype and rs62256378 was detected (P = 9.5 × 10(-5)), with the strongest effect being observed in APOE-ε4 noncarriers. Clinically, rs62256378 was associated with rate of cognitive decline in AD dementia patients (P = 3.1 × 10(-3)). Functional microglia experiments showed that SUCLG2 was involved in clearance of Aβ1-42. 	 21123754 20932310 21300948 21364746 21295139 21460840 21460841 21514250 21130159 20696495 22840745 18392745 1693471 2047500 9765291 16032514 16490960 16784338 17447609 17701901 17848793 18549781 18701698 18852200 19339619 19339779 19543373 19734902 20394760 23573206 20981092 21084733 19734903 19837719 20023658 19833838 20552234 23708142 24162737 23562540 10816430 11719900 12177636 6610841 22971100 23254930 21148344

25027321	Genome-wide association and admixture analysis of glaucoma in the Women's Health Initiative.	We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and admixture analysis of glaucoma in 12 008 African-American and Hispanic women (age 50-79 years) from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Although GWAS of glaucoma have been conducted on several populations, this is the first to look at glaucoma in individuals of African-American and Hispanic race/ethnicity. Prevalent and incident glaucoma was determined by self-report from study questionnaires administered at baseline (1993-1998) and annually through 2005. For African Americans, there was a total of 658 prevalent cases, 1062 incident cases and 6067 individuals who never progressed to glaucoma. For our replication cohort, we used the WHI Hispanics, including 153 prevalent cases, 336 incident cases and 2685 non-cases. We found an association of African ancestry with glaucoma incidence in African Americans (hazards ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.023-2.56, P = 0.038) and in Hispanics (hazards ratio 3.21, 95% CI 1.32-7.80, P = 0.011). Although we found that no previously identified glaucoma SNPs replicated in either the WHI African Americans or Hispanics, a risk score combining all previously reported hits was significant in African-American prevalent cases (P = 0.0046), and was in the expected direction in the incident cases, as well as in the Hispanic incident cases. Additionally, after imputing to 1000 Genomes, two less common independent SNPs were suggestive in African Americans, but had too low of an allele frequency in Hispanics to test for replication. These results suggest the possibility of a distinct genetic architecture underlying glaucoma in individuals of African ancestry. 	 22419738 16832022 22820512 22955989 22955616 22939635 22922875 23078191 23726366 11315092 14575938 14575939 14691154 15078671 15712363 15939473 16488940 17690259 17716734 18292342 18703928 19474294 16773560 21031451 16862161 16877390 17003413 17652737 21254217 21549278 21532571 21481477 22021425 22138821 22428042 22570617 22605921 19597492 19625618 20363506 20835238 22792221
25030430	Genome-wide association study of hepatitis C virus- and cryoglobulin-related vasculitis.	The host genetic basis of mixed cryoglobulin vasculitis is not well understood and has not been studied in large cohorts. A genome-wide association study was conducted among 356 hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-positive individuals with cryoglobulin-related vasculitis and 447 ethnically matched, HCV RNA-positive controls. All cases had both serum cryoglobulins and a vasculitis syndrome. A total of 899 641 markers from the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad chip were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for sex, as well as genetically determined ancestry. Replication of select single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted using 91 cases and 180 controls, adjusting for sex and country of origin. The most significant associations were identified on chromosome 6 near the NOTCH4 and MHC class II genes. A genome-wide significant association was detected on chromosome 6 at SNP rs9461776 (odds ratio=2.16, P=1.16E-07) between HLA-DRB1 and DQA1: this association was further replicated in additional independent samples (meta-analysis P=7.1 × 10(-9)). A genome-wide significant association with cryoglobulin-related vasculitis was identified with SNPs near NOTCH4 and MHC Class II genes. The two regions are correlated and it is difficult to disentangle which gene is responsible for the association with mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis in this extended major histocompatibility complex region. 	 21303705 22147661 22820512 22852020 23073858 23196322 23420232 23172780 24024840 10615995 10760044 11592376 11972876 12589427 14730600 15190522 6421668 8260706 8730485 8730493 8730494 10406175 15642884 16729318 17314160 17554300 17572673 17701901 17936221 17936227 18796155 18758442 19143814 20418889 20596022 20981092 23921995 9490691 9531323 9696490
25035420	Identification of three novel genetic variations associated with electrocardiographic traits (QRS duration and PR interval) in East Asians.	The electrocardiogram has several advantages in detecting cardiac arrhythmia-it is readily available, noninvasive and cost-efficient. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with electrocardiogram measures. We performed a genome-wide association study using Korea Association Resource data for the discovery phase (Phase 1, n = 6805) and two consecutive replication studies in Japanese populations (Phase 2, n = 2285; Phase 3, n = 5010) for QRS duration and PR interval. Three novel loci were identified: rs2483280 (PRDM16 locus) and rs335206 (PRDM6 locus) were associated with QRS duration, and rs17026156 (SLC8A1 locus) correlated with PR interval. PRDM16 was recently identified as a causative gene of left ventricular non-compaction and dilated cardiomyopathy in 1p36 deletion syndrome, which is characterized by heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Thus, our finding that a PRDM16 SNP is linked to QRS duration strongly implicates PRDM16 in cardiac function. In addition, C allele of rs17026156 increases PR interval (beta ± SE, 2.39 ± 0.40 ms) and exists far more frequently in East Asians (0.46) than in Europeans and Africans (0.05 and 0.08, respectively). 	
25042611	The genetics of hemoglobin A2 regulation in sickle cell anemia.	Hemoglobin A2 , a tetramer of α- and δ-globin chains, comprises less than 3% of total hemoglobin in normal adults. In northern Europeans, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HBS1L-MYB locus on chromosome 6q and the HBB cluster on chromosome 11p were associated with HbA2 levels. We examined the genetic basis of HbA2 variability in sickle cell anemia using genome-wide association studies. HbA2 levels were associated with SNPs in the HBS1L-MYB interval and SNPs in BCL11A. These effects are mediated by the association of these loci with γ-globin gene expression and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. The association of polymorphisms downstream of the β-globin gene (HBB) cluster on chromosome 11 with HbA2 was not mediated by HbF. In sickle cell anemia, levels of HbA2 appear to be modulated by trans-acting genes that affect HBG expression and perhaps also elements within the β-globin gene cluster. HbA2 is expressed pancellularly and can inhibit HbS polymerization. It remains to be seen if genetic regulators of HbA2 can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.	 480348 284392 6159787 7114401 6290076 6290997 6876159 6199038 6722353 2999704 1698102 1714415 1932737 1940581 1719807 7685112 8674201 9207479 9858241 13800165 15730849 16370492 16968208 17592125 17701901 17767159 17712044 18245381 18266208 18667698 18691915 19056937 19699350 20018918 20201948 20616382 21057501 21220744 21385855 21490337 21527519 21879898 22641398 22936743 23043469 23474875 24115442 24222332 24614105 24585758 11703409 4187025 264791 719749 6158093
25038754	Genome-wide association analysis in East Asians identifies breast cancer susceptibility loci at 1q32.1, 5q14.3 and 15q26.1.	In a three-stage genome-wide association study among East Asian women including 22,780 cases and 24,181 controls, we identified 3 genetic loci newly associated with breast cancer risk, including rs4951011 at 1q32.1 (in intron 2 of the ZC3H11A gene; P=8.82×10(-9)), rs10474352 at 5q14.3 (near the ARRDC3 gene; P=1.67×10(-9)) and rs2290203 at 15q26.1 (in intron 14 of the PRC1 gene; P=4.25×10(-8)). We replicated these associations in 16,003 cases and 41,335 controls of European ancestry (P=0.030, 0.004 and 0.010, respectively). Data from the ENCODE Project suggest that variants rs4951011 and rs10474352 might be located in an enhancer region and transcription factor binding sites, respectively. This study provides additional insights into the genetics and biology of breast cancer.	 18974064 19219042 20502693 18782836 16862161 20016685 22865192 20603614 16236996 20504332 22951594 22064851 19031103 21908515 21497495 22037553 10861490 22955616 15531928 20616382 23648477 20585626 22383897 19996398 15625105 18089785 23535733 20542480 15052270 23535825 21058334 23000897 22955989 20634204 23505254 17701901 22452962 12718640 19396169 23535729 23319801 21514219
25044758	Genome-wide association study of height-adjusted BMI in childhood identifies functional variant in ADCY3.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BMI are mostly undertaken under the assumption that "kg/m(2) " is an index of weight fully adjusted for height, but in general this is not true. The aim here was to assess the contribution of common genetic variation to a adjusted version of that phenotype which appropriately accounts for covariation in height in children.	 22507743 17151600 22941192 17463249 22507742 19557161 18095172 16344844 19715440 17434869 19750222 8725168 21379325 9356525 3800308 20881960 19056611 20616382 20935630 20935629 22344219 23207404 23086283 21058334 20802229 12503609 20634204 12120099 11231154 17895882 20702402 23776890 16270304
25056061	Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.	Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia. 	 19571809 20369019 22241776 16863597 23974872 22384356 22083728 18677311 19539887 15279046 22037552 25642630 15652477 23128233 22714935 19002139 22883433 22138821 13678875 23104008 12668349 18711365 20881960 24463507 21926974 22614287 20832056 21747397 23453885 22037555 21791550 17909124 24253340 19571808 24728292 22823436 14060771 24463508 20595427 5954044 21931320 21407268 22513993 20981092 16172203 21339752 22955828 19571811 19013282 14662550 22777127
25055868	Genome-wide association study of electrocardiographic parameters identifies a new association for PR interval and confirms previously reported associations.	Previous reports have described several associations of PR, QRS, QT and heart rate with genomic variations by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In the present study, we examined the association of ∼2.5 million SNPs from 2994 Japanese healthy volunteers obtained from the JPDSC database with electrocardiographic parameters. We confirmed associations of PR interval, QRS duration and QT interval in individuals of Japanese ancestry with 11 of the 45 SNPs (6 of 20 for QT, 5 of 19 for PR and 0 of 6 for QRS) observed among individuals of European, African and Asian (Indian and Korean) ancestries. Those results indicate that many of the electrocardiographic associations with genes are shared by different ethnic groups including Japanese. Possible novel associations found in this study were validated by Korean data. As a result, we identified a novel association of SNP rs4952632[G] (maps near SLC8A1, sodium-calcium exchanger) (P = 7.595 × 10(-6)) with PR interval in Japanese individuals, and replication testing among Koreans confirmed the association of the same SNP with prolonged PR interval. Meta-analysis of the Japanese and Korean datasets demonstrated highly significant associations of SNP rs4952632[G] with a 2.325-ms (95% CI, 1.693-2.957 ms) longer PR interval per minor allele copy (P = 5.598 × 10(-13)). Cell-type-specific SLC8A1 knockout mice have demonstrated a regulatory role of sodium-calcium exchanger in automaticity and conduction in sinoatrial node, atrium and atrioventricular node. Our findings support a functional role of sodium-calcium exchanger in human atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction as suggested by genetically modified mouse models. 	
25057126	Meta-analysis identifies loci affecting levels of the potential osteoarthritis biomarkers sCOMP and uCTX-II with genome wide significance.	Research for the use of biomarkers in osteoarthritis (OA) is promising, however, adequate discrimination between patients and controls may be hampered due to innate differences. We set out to identify loci influencing levels of serum cartilage oligomeric protein (sCOMP) and urinary C-telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX-II).	
25231870	Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.	Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition. 	 23738509 19219042 20502693 22102887 17873877 22941192 24770850 20714348 23359819 22286170 23650335 22685416 22031444 23474282 18344981 23374354 20833654 18077366 19128478 19654370 22233810 18193047 22692066 20881960 18462017 24183450 24076603 23348069 23209423 21102462 20616382 20935630 21637794 22446964 20485568 22990020 19430480 21829388 23164700 20670100 21831236 24816254 19644074 17873875 12219071 22426310 22307276 17601927 19263252 22006096 11245924 19222302 19726747 23202124 21407268 21602305 15163330 19361613 24248183 21717116 21167468 23354331 17873874 20351726 21226949 22504420 23535729 22719049 17704508 21129726 20016592 21691150 23345460 19966804 23622250 24013639
25060954	Salt-inducible kinase 3, SIK3, is a new gene associated with hearing.	Hearing function is known to be heritable, but few significant and reproducible associations of genetic variants have been identified to date in the adult population. In this study, genome-wide association results of hearing function from the G-EAR consortium and TwinsUK were used for meta-analysis. Hearing ability in eight population samples of Northern and Southern European ancestry (n = 4591) and the Silk Road (n = 348) was measured using pure-tone audiometry and summarized using principal component (PC) analysis. Genome-wide association analyses for PC1-3 were conducted separately in each sample assuming an additive model adjusted for age, sex and relatedness of subjects. Meta-analysis was performed using 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested against each of the three PCs of hearing ability in 4939 individuals. A single SNP lying in intron 6 of the salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) gene was found to be associated with hearing PC2 (P = 3.7×10(-8)) and further supported by whole-genome sequence in a subset. To determine the relevance of this gene in the ear, expression of the Sik3 protein was studied in mouse cochlea of different ages. Sik3 was expressed in murine hair cells during early development and in cells of the spiral ganglion during early development and adulthood. Our results suggest a developmental role of Sik3 in hearing and may be required for the maintenance of adult auditory function. 	 22318228 23247886 17452741 19925333 18974171 22558162 23285279 11754168 17384015 23128226 20347966 22253318 21886636 21493956 16702566 15803201 7457920 19715440 9099560 21989106 19047183 23393134 16369173 20140255 12958120 20616382 17660554 8427676 18760390 17468767 16398896 21058334 20068591 19812666 22662228 9733963 18543032 15134808 17513527 18060068 7055241 12622536 11425887 17113254 19543373 23033494 10367922 19293293
25064009	Large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies six new risk loci for Parkinson's disease.	We conducted a meta-analysis of Parkinson's disease genome-wide association studies using a common set of 7,893,274 variants across 13,708 cases and 95,282 controls. Twenty-six loci were identified as having genome-wide significant association; these and 6 additional previously reported loci were then tested in an independent set of 5,353 cases and 5,551 controls. Of the 32 tested SNPs, 24 replicated, including 6 newly identified loci. Conditional analyses within loci showed that four loci, including GBA, GAK-DGKQ, SNCA and the HLA region, contain a secondary independent risk variant. In total, we identified and replicated 28 independent risk variants for Parkinson's disease across 24 loci. Although the effect of each individual locus was small, risk profile analysis showed substantial cumulative risk in a comparison of the highest and lowest quintiles of genetic risk (odds ratio (OR) = 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.55-4.30; P = 2 × 10(-16)). We also show six risk loci associated with proximal gene expression or DNA methylation. 	 21084426 21947855 21877163 20881426 21216877 21391235 21565292 21248740 21738487 21738488 21812969 22438815 22451204 22820512 22786590 22911860 22892372 22747683 23395371 23153929 23874508 23770607 23731541 15122513 18852200 18985386 19369658 19915576 20031568 20070850 20485568 20616382 20711177 20971364 20981092 21292315
25064007	A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine.	Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is a common spinal disorder among the elderly that causes myelopathy and radiculopathy. To identify genetic factors for OPLL, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in ∼8,000 individuals followed by a replication study using an additional ∼7,000 individuals. We identified six susceptibility loci for OPLL: 20p12.3 (rs2423294: P = 1.10 × 10(-13)), 8q23.1 (rs374810: P = 1.88 × 10(-13)), 12p11.22 (rs1979679: P = 4.34 × 10(-12)), 12p12.2 (rs11045000: P = 2.95 × 10(-11)), 8q23.3 (rs13279799: P = 1.28 × 10(-10)) and 6p21.1 (rs927485: P = 9.40 × 10(-9)). Analyses of gene expression in and around the loci suggested that several genes are involved in OPLL etiology through membranous and/or endochondral ossification processes. Our results bring new insight to the etiology of OPLL. 	 9662402 16862161 12958705 24361881 24670764 17982410 22791528 17688057 22119785 16609882 9787080 21262772 22820512 1566186 3329634 24516404 10982675 19557189 10453738 18817904 22504420 8658251 22127703 16357527 21058334 11101529 23138351 20634204 8609176 17701901 19633697 12450279 10364246 20981092 20702402 19200523 22079544
25065397	Genome-wide screening for DNA variants associated with reading and language traits.	Reading and language abilities are heritable traits that are likely to share some genetic influences with each other. To identify pleiotropic genetic variants affecting these traits, we first performed a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) meta-analysis using three richly characterized datasets comprising individuals with histories of reading or language problems, and their siblings. GWAS was performed in a total of 1862 participants using the first principal component computed from several quantitative measures of reading- and language-related abilities, both before and after adjustment for performance IQ. We identified novel suggestive associations at the SNPs rs59197085 and rs5995177 (uncorrected P ≈ 10(-7) for each SNP), located respectively at the CCDC136/FLNC and RBFOX2 genes. Each of these SNPs then showed evidence for effects across multiple reading and language traits in univariate association testing against the individual traits. FLNC encodes a structural protein involved in cytoskeleton remodelling, while RBFOX2 is an important regulator of alternative splicing in neurons. The CCDC136/FLNC locus showed association with a comparable reading/language measure in an independent sample of 6434 participants from the general population, although involving distinct alleles of the associated SNP. Our datasets will form an important part of on-going international efforts to identify genes contributing to reading and language skills. 	 15112360 21310003 18829873 15737942 22507743 24068947 21457949 21620354 20949370 15717286 20585591 23036959 8324999 24117048 17119535 12360321 21894572 15535741 23602712 7584287 12599096 22238103 11791209 18005161 10946751 22357600 17309879 17233642 9430746 20828676 19019849 20846247 24022301 21614001 20955937 21193955 21165691 22820512 11665325 19304338 18987363 17597587 19786962 19679544 20616382 16278297 15917206 19646677 17684495 22996553 20811451 18652545 11506541 7886145 9974150 24024963 20598278 24133036 2738467 11765981 24039908 22513218 24518835 12746395 2376893 22383464 19423554 22276678 17850323 15514892 17701901 22513993 23190410 21051773 18506044 15133743 16254601 24571439 23738518 16844106 11079429 21765815 12954984 18633328
25080503	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies two loci associated with circulating osteoprotegerin levels.	Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is involved in bone homeostasis and tumor cell survival. Circulating OPG levels are also important biomarkers of various clinical traits, such as cancers and atherosclerosis. OPG levels were measured in serum or in plasma. In a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in up to 10 336 individuals from European and Asian origin, we discovered that variants >100 kb upstream of the TNFRSF11B gene encoding OPG and another new locus on chromosome 17q11.2 were significantly associated with OPG variation. We also identified a suggestive locus on chromosome 14q21.2 associated with the trait. Moreover, we estimated that over half of the heritability of OPG levels could be explained by all variants examined in our study. Our findings provide further insight into the genetic regulation of circulating OPG levels. 	 10811631 24210251 11160187 11315092 15034190 15064358 15173242 15252851 15280347 9108485 9434163 9573043 19576326 19544400 19654370 20158880 19922823 20354512 20616382 21397060 21270110 22958900 22520966 23715323 23785302 24068893 24013639 10952716 9834095 15561602 15564564 15567943 15716906 15716907 15781001 15799029 16155791 16199517 16265708 16287088 21433226 21762114 21618601 22064851 22075998 22024687 22426310 22504420 22506827 22955989 16585187 16815299 17143516 17147692 18070364 18398418 19297801 19474294 11950689 12054556 12124406 14523602

Despite strong evidence for heritability, genome-wide association studies have had little success in identification of risk loci associated with epilepsy, probably because of relatively small sample sizes and insufficient power. We aimed to identify risk loci through meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for all epilepsy and the two largest clinical subtypes (genetic generalised epilepsy and focal epilepsy).	 23962720 9520007 23280773 23586701 24014518 23934111 23791709 23974872 18275925 16288297 17559416 18171927 21824415 23102693 11756608 19369037 18332222 9546323 20541594 22883433 11359211 22340724 23090947 11254444 23449449 22815495 21892150 19136953 21703448 20616382 24468822 21791550 22949513 17166592 20398883 21173574 23783032 20522523 21205691 10742094 20196795 21277190 24076602 18469813 12891677 22116939 22752157 17701901 21833088 17247344 22513993 23708187 17614211 24337656 16054936 22863189 22642626 2502382
25082827	A genome-wide association study identifies a novel locus at 6q22.1 associated with ulcerative colitis.	The genetic analysis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has provided new insights into the etiology of this prevalent inflammatory bowel disease. However, most of the heritability of UC (>70%) has still not been characterized. To identify new risk loci for UC we have performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Southern European population and undertaken a meta-analysis study combining the newly genotyped 825 UC patients and 1525 healthy controls from Spain with the six previously published GWAS comprising 6687 cases and 19 718 controls from Northern-European ancestry. We identified a novel locus with genome-wide significance at 6q22.1 [rs2858829, P = 8.97 × 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.12 (1.08-1.16)] that was validated with genotype data from a replication cohort of the same Southern European ancestry consisting in 1073 cases and 1279 controls [combined P = 7.59 × 10(-10), OR (95% CI) = 1.12 (1.08-1.16)]. Furthermore, we confirmed the association of 33 reported associations with UC and we nominally validated the GWAS results of nine new risk loci (P < 0.05, same direction of effect). SNP rs2858829 lies in an intergenic region and is a strong cis-eQTL for FAM26F gene, a gene that is shown to be selectively upregulated in UC colonic mucosa with active inflammation. Our results provide new insight into the genetic risk background of UC, confirming that there is a genetic risk component that differentiates from Crohn's Disease, the other major form of inflammatory bowel disease.

25086665	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer.	We performed a multistage genome-wide association study including 7,683 individuals with pancreatic cancer and 14,397 controls of European descent. Four new loci reached genome-wide significance: rs6971499 at 7q32.3 (LINC-PINT, per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.84, P = 3.0 × 10(-12)), rs7190458 at 16q23.1 (BCAR1/CTRB1/CTRB2, OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.30-1.65, P = 1.1 × 10(-10)), rs9581943 at 13q12.2 (PDX1, OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20, P = 2.4 × 10(-9)) and rs16986825 at 22q12.1 (ZNRF3, OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25, P = 1.2 × 10(-8)).

25140149	Genetic variation modifies risk for neurodegeneration based on biomarker status.	While a great deal of work has gone into understanding the relationship between Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain atrophy, and disease progression, less work has attempted to investigate how genetic variation modifies these relationships. The goal of this study was two-fold. First, we sought to identify high-risk vs. low-risk individuals based on their CSF tau and Aβ load and characterize these individuals with regard to brain atrophy in an AD-relevant region of interest. Next, we sought to identify genetic variants that modified the relationship between biomarker classification and neurodegeneration.	 15590150 19260027 24260488 20182051 17208336 9931269 21181717 22064851 19042931 21311900 17903299 22746342 19038212 20083042 20594615 19636049 23107432 20186853 11242114 15275931 24656848 16415888 16530430 19822868 14676043 21553300 24112793 22258513 19636048 24596558 21123754 10619420 20570401 12601108 24077433 17701901 17998437 20887964 22815558 18692273 9931268 14970312 23332364 20051356 24026422 22430496
25096241	Trans-ethnic meta-analysis of white blood cell phenotypes.	White blood cell (WBC) count is a common clinical measure used as a predictor of certain aspects of human health, including immunity and infection status. WBC count is also a complex trait that varies among individuals and ancestry groups. Differences in linkage disequilibrium structure and heterogeneity in allelic effects are expected to play a role in the associations observed between populations. Prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses have identified genomic loci associated with WBC and its subtypes, but much of the heritability of these phenotypes remains unexplained. Using GWAS summary statistics for over 50 000 individuals from three diverse populations (Japanese, African-American and European ancestry), a Bayesian model methodology was employed to account for heterogeneity between ancestry groups. This approach was used to perform a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of total WBC, neutrophil and monocyte counts. Ten previously known associations were replicated and six new loci were identified, including several regions harboring genes related to inflammation and immune cell function. Ninety-five percent credible interval regions were calculated to narrow the association signals and fine-map the putatively causal variants within loci. Finally, a conditional analysis was performed on the most significant SNPs identified by the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (MA), and nine secondary signals within loci previously associated with WBC or its subtypes were identified. This work illustrates the potential of trans-ethnic analysis and ascribes a critical role to multi-ethnic cohorts and consortia in exploring complex phenotypes with respect to variants that lie outside the European-biased GWAS pool. 	 20502693 21738478 18974171 17873877 17977790 22941192 17481443 22286170 16000389 22125221 1442716 18344981 21971685 23847614 20833654 23972371 19128478 22037903 22233810 18193047 21565292 22692066 22869904 19763151 23022100 22820512 9600484 22694930 21738480 20509871 18179887 20616382 22277899 10762551 20228798 18852203 23575227 22446964 22315422 23406875 21829388 22155111 19644074 17873875 21058334 16934002 22426310 21738479 19051310 16432087 19222302 10385477 20179745 7581446 23263863 22139419 22479202 20981092 21167468 22045556 17873874 21598361 21267066 21691150 23345460 19966804 14685227 19180233

25102180	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in African Americans provides insights into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more prevalent in African Americans than in Europeans. However, little is known about the genetic risk in African Americans despite the recent identification of more than 70 T2D loci primarily by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of T2D in African Americans, the MEta-analysis of type 2 DIabetes in African Americans (MEDIA) Consortium examined 17 GWAS on T2D comprising 8,284 cases and 15,543 controls in African Americans in stage 1 analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analysis was conducted in each study under the additive model after adjustment for age, sex, study site, and principal components. Meta-analysis of approximately 2.6 million genotyped and imputed SNPs in all studies was conducted using an inverse variance-weighted fixed effect model. Replications were performed to follow up 21 loci in up to 6,061 cases and 5,483 controls in African Americans, and 8,130 cases and 38,987 controls of European ancestry. We identified three known loci (TCF7L2, HMGA2 and KCNQ1) and two novel loci (HLA-B and INS-IGF2) at genome-wide significance (4.15 × 10(-94)<P<5 × 10(-8), odds ratio (OR)  = 1.09 to 1.36). Fine-mapping revealed that 88 of 158 previously identified T2D or glucose homeostasis loci demonstrated nominal to highly significant association (2.2 × 10(-23) < locus-wide P<0.05). These novel and previously identified loci yielded a sibling relative risk of 1.19, explaining 17.5% of the phenotypic variance of T2D on the liability scale in African Americans. Overall, this study identified two novel susceptibility loci for T2D in African Americans. A substantial number of previously reported loci are transferable to African Americans after accounting for linkage disequilibrium, enabling fine mapping of causal variants in trans-ethnic meta-analysis studies.	 22109280 22393536 22955989 22955616 23128226 23142383 23398374 23801574 23945395 24509480 20195508 10825161 11315092 12499305 15111499 15502828 8462772 7835686 9545414 10218989 15297300 16415888 17289997 17434869 17384015 17476475 17554300 17632545 17924348 18252895 18310307 19143813 18830248 18711367 18711366 19543373 19401414 19455305 20040588 20174558 20233392 20509871 20581827 20616382 19430480 20981092 20938745 21058334 21142536 21304890 21188353 21398525 21636800 21573907 21799836 21874001 10839546 21829393 22064851 22158537 22238593 22109281 22885922
25105248	Trans-ethnic genome-wide association study of colorectal cancer identifies a new susceptibility locus in VTI1A.	The genetic basis of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well explained by known risk polymorphisms. Here we perform a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies in 2,627 cases and 3,797 controls of Japanese ancestry and 1,894 cases and 4,703 controls of African ancestry, to identify genetic variants that contribute to CRC susceptibility. We replicate genome-wide statistically significant associations (P<5 × 10(-8)) in 16,823 cases and 18,211 controls of European ancestry. This study reveals a new pan-ethnic CRC risk locus at 10q25 (rs12241008, intronic to VTI1A; P=1.4 × 10(-9)), providing additional insight into the aetiology of CRC and highlighting the value of association mapping in diverse populations. 	 10891514 11315092 12111919 16131485 16862161 17401363 17618283 17924348 18252211 19543373 19648918 19836008 20101243 20616382 20634204 21262811 21892161 21761138 22243751 22363440 22955616 22923026 23143601 22976474 23266556 23851122
25108386	Genome-wide association analysis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome identifies two new susceptibility loci at 1p31.2 and 10q21.3.	To identify new genetic risk factors for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 2,208,258 SNPs in 774 cases and 2,009 controls with follow-up in a collection of 415 cases and 2,006 controls and a further collection of 349 cases and 1,588 controls from a Han Chinese population. We identified three loci associated with VKH syndrome susceptibility (IL23R-C1orf141, rs117633859, P(combined) = 3.42 × 10(-21), odds ratio (OR) = 1.82; ADO-ZNF365-EGR2, rs442309, P(combined) = 2.97 × 10(-11), OR = 1.37; and HLA-DRB1/DQA1, rs3021304, P(combined) = 1.26 × 10(-118), OR = 2.97). The five non-HLA genes were all expressed in human iris tissue. IL23R was also expressed in the ciliary body, and EGR2 was expressed in the ciliary body and choroid. The risk G allele of rs117633859 in the promoter region of IL23R exhibited low transcriptional activation in a cell-based reporter assay and was associated with diminished IL23R mRNA expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	 1970380 22532805 16199517 22384356 23042114 11336942 10682969 24194192 19122825 7967215 17068223 17123618 20116410 20622879 19169254 17966091 17289997 21666691 21810982 17236132 9121744 7928186 17435756 18282809 23396137 20228799 2003797 18587394 23291587 22378604 21743469 20953190 22460149 17554300 23021953 15131651 20622878 17701901 19122664 23712092 23633568 21257989 21278746 20375120 17952073 7725227 1575232 8045716
25108383	Genome-wide association analyses identify variants in developmental genes associated with hypospadias.	Hypospadias is a common congenital condition in boys in which the urethra opens on the underside of the penis. We performed a genome-wide association study on 1,006 surgery-confirmed hypospadias cases and 5,486 controls from Denmark. After replication genotyping of an additional 1,972 cases and 1,812 controls from Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, 18 genomic regions showed independent association with P < 5 × 10(-8). Together, these loci explain 9% of the liability to developing this condition. Several of the identified regions harbor genes with key roles in embryonic development (including HOXA4, IRX5, IRX6 and EYA1). Subsequent pathway analysis with GRAIL and DEPICT provided additional insight into possible genetic mechanisms causing hypospadias. 	 21067998 21113153 11315092 23132118 12111919 20510229 22371315 23177175 22138821 11846609 18637150 19767754 17003840 19602639 23128233 9457903 21909110 21968101 11206481 17218491 12783783 23563608 17344885 20676075 23175610 21102462 3992076 20616382 23704328 21376301 20010834 20354512 20517342 19557189 21152010 22504420 21931568 23793025 16516617 20634204 17701901 19561590 22080510 21737437 18042671 8431945 20981092 21167468 21909115 23535729 10802651 20601685 19543373 24013639 11572091
25108385	A common missense variant in NUDT15 confers susceptibility to thiopurine-induced leukopenia.	Thiopurine therapy, commonly used in autoimmune conditions, can be complicated by life-threatening leukopenia. This leukopenia is associated with genetic variation in TPMT (encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase). Despite a lower frequency of TPMT mutations in Asians, the incidence of thiopurine-induced leukopenia is higher in Asians than in individuals of European descent. Here we performed an Immunochip-based 2-stage association study in 978 Korean subjects with Crohn's disease treated with thiopurines. We identified a nonsynonymous SNP in NUDT15 (encoding p.Arg139Cys) that was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (odds ratio (OR) = 35.6; P(combined) = 4.88 × 10(-94)). In Koreans, this variant demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 89.4% and 93.2%, respectively, for thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (in comparison to 12.1% and 97.6% for TPMT variants). Although rare, this SNP was also strongly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease of European descent (OR = 9.50; P = 4.64 × 10(-4)). Thus, NUDT15 is a pharmacogenetic determinant for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in diverse populations.	 19160175 16862161 21723857 8174958 11337944 21690596 2802419 10833476 19252404 22972046 10208641 23149442 11889067 22556419 19682195 19631285 19543373 20308917

25014791	Immunochip identifies novel, and replicates known, genetic risk loci for rheumatoid arthritis in black South Africans.	The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in black South Africans. Black South African RA patients (n = 263) were compared with healthy controls (n = 374). Genotyping was performed using the Immunochip, and four-digit high-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed by DNA sequencing of exon 2. Standard quality control measures were implemented on the data. The strongest associations were in the intergenic region between the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci. After conditioning on HLA-DRB1 alleles, the effect in the rest of the extended major histocompatibility (MHC) diminished. Non-HLA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intergenic regions LOC389203|RBPJ, LOC100131131|IL1R1, KIAA1919|REV3L, LOC643749|TRAF3IP2, and SNPs in the intron and untranslated regions (UTR) of IRF1 and the intronic region of ICOS and KIAA1542 showed association with RA (p < 5 × 10(-5)). Of the SNPs previously associated with RA in Caucasians, one SNP, rs874040, locating to the intergenic region LOC389203|RBPJ was replicated in this study. None of the variants in the PTPN22 gene was significantly associated. The seropositive subgroups showed similar results to the overall cohort. The effects observed across the HLA region are most likely due to HLA-DRB1, and secondary effects in the extended MHC cannot be detected. Seven non-HLA loci are associated with RA in black South Africans. Similar to Caucasians, the intergenic region between LOC38920 and RBPJ is associated with RA in this population. The strong association of the R620W variant of the PTPN22 gene with RA in Caucasians was not replicated since this variant was monomorphic in our study, but other SNP variants of the PTPN22 gene were also not associated with RA in black South Africans, suggesting that this locus does not play a major role in RA in this population. 	 10643697 12849951 12833157 15077293 23143596 23122694 23380221 23651858 23603761 23603763 24076602 24059264 15208781 1137440 3358796 2772763 2810257 1598686 15485997 15998632 16200584 16380915 16385500 16862161 16690758 19470526 20353565 20453842 20196860 20953186 20953188 21085122 21120996 21102463 21300955 21408207 22057235 22286218 21978430 22922229 22936693 17462507 17804842 17932559 18309376 19116921 19180477 20031576 20084087 20008090
25129146	Joint analysis of three genome-wide association studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese populations.	We conducted a joint (pooled) analysis of three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in individuals of Chinese ancestry (5,337 ESCC cases and 5,787 controls) with 9,654 ESCC cases and 10,058 controls for follow-up. In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, study and two eigenvectors, two new loci achieved genome-wide significance, marked by rs7447927 at 5q31.2 (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.88; P = 7.72 × 10(-20)) and rs1642764 at 17p13.1 (per-allele OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85-0.91; P = 3.10 × 10(-13)). rs7447927 is a synonymous SNP in TMEM173, and rs1642764 is an intronic SNP in ATP1B2, near TP53. Furthermore, a locus in the HLA class II region at 6p21.32 (rs35597309) achieved genome-wide significance in the two populations at highest risk for ESSC (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.22-1.46; P = 1.99 × 10(-10)). Our joint analysis identifies new ESCC susceptibility loci overall as well as a new locus unique to the population in the Taihang Mountain region at high risk of ESCC. 	 15455378 23770605 21699788 23571737 22829776 20453839 22064851 22961001 19327566 20729852 23219370 22960999 18850166 20512145 11309337 21131588 23361049 20729853 23143601 22886559 18724357 19578364 22610502 19838193 20186831 22955989 7600541 21642993 22323360 20195802 6992989 22807686
25138779	Genome-wide association study of maternal and inherited effects on left-sided cardiac malformations.	Congenital left-sided lesions (LSLs) are serious, heritable malformations of the heart. However, little is known about the genetic causes of LSLs. This study was undertaken to identify common variants acting through the genotype of the affected individual (i.e. case) or the mother (e.g. via an in utero effect) that influence the risk of LSLs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using data from 377 LSL case-parent triads, with follow-up studies in an independent sample of 224 triads and analysis of the combined data. Associations with both the case and maternal genotypes were assessed using log-linear analyses under an additive model. An association between LSLs and the case genotype for one intergenic SNP on chromosome 16 achieved genome-wide significance in the combined data (rs8061121, combined P = 4.0 × 10(-9); relative risk to heterozygote: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.9-3.7). In the combined data, there was also suggestive evidence of association between LSLs and the case genotype for a variant in the synaptoporin gene (rs1975649, combined P = 3.4 × 10(-7); relative risk to heterozygote: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4-2.0) and between LSLs and the maternal genotype for an intergenic SNP on chromosome 10 (rs11008222, combined P = 6.3 × 10(-7); relative risk to heterozygote: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4-2.0). This is the first GWAS of LSLs to evaluate associations with both the case and maternal genotypes. The results of this study identify three candidate LSL susceptibility loci, including one that appears to be associated with the risk of LSLs via the maternal genotype. 	 19822228 22449847 9529360 9651244 9801020 15690347 15877233 16093287 16014814 16389035 16524890 16839542 17022030 21513519 22419666 17669267 17632545 17729292 18398431 19046347 19298921 19459879 19142209 19500772 19628123 19714205 19796755 10090904 21564312 22450905 21457232 22513993 22939634 22969434 22994552 23088992 23132673 23281074 23266814 23297363 23665959 23708190 23708191 24021551 23979609 24487584 11230613 12375236 12974474 15211708 5106369 20417496 20664391 20468076 20702402 20810466 21045784 21290564 21345403 3964990
25133637	Genome-wide association studies and heritability estimates of body mass index related phenotypes in Bangladeshi adults.	Many health outcomes are influenced by a person's body mass index, as well as by the trajectory of body mass index through a lifetime. Although previous research has established that body mass index related traits are influenced by genetics, the relationship between these traits and genetics has not been well characterized in people of South Asian ancestry. To begin to characterize this relationship, we analyzed the association between common genetic variation and five phenotypes related to body mass index in a population-based sample of 5,354 Bangladeshi adults. We discovered a significant association between SNV rs347313 (intron of NOS1AP) and change in body mass index in women over two years. In a linear mixed-model, the G allele was associated with an increase of 0.25 kg/m2 in body mass index over two years (p-value of 2.3·10-8). We also estimated the heritability of these phenotypes from our genotype data. We found significant estimates of heritability for all of the body mass index-related phenotypes. Our study evaluated the genetic determinants of body mass index related phenotypes for the first time in South Asians. The results suggest that these phenotypes are heritable and some of this heritability is driven by variation that differs from those previously reported. We also provide evidence that the genetic etiology of body mass index related traits may differ by ancestry, sex, and environment, and consequently that these factors should be considered when assessing the genetic determinants of the risk of body mass index-related disease. 	 22645519 23583978 23166209 12711737 18551109 20562875 22426805 19079261 9459447 21552263 16160703 24786797 10546691 24173550 19890430 12075580 16926276 20032266 19776182 17986696 23590571 10084240 22820512 20935630 22446040 23737753 12164465 16648850 22344221 17903300 23563607 18454148 21058334 20031603 14726171 21701570 22383894 15191932 20634204 19305409 18388152 23251661 24646999 21345101 19305408 20601685 19079260 22706312 17903298
25134534	Genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for epithelial ovarian cancer in Han Chinese women.	Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies worldwide. Here we perform a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Han Chinese women to identify risk genetic variants for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We scan 900,015 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,057 EOC cases and 1,191 controls in stage I, and replicate 41 SNPs (P(meta)<10(-4)) in 960 EOC cases and 1,799 controls (stage II), and an additional 492 EOC cases and 1,004 controls (stage III). Finally, we identify two EOC susceptibility loci at 9q22.33 (rs1413299 in COL15A1, P(meta) = 1.88 × 10(-8)) and 10p11.21 (rs1192691 near ANKRD30A, P(meta) = 2.62 × 10(-8)), and two consistently replicated loci at 12q14.2 (rs11175194 in SRGAP1, P(meta) = 1.14 × 10(-7)) and 9q34.2 (rs633862 near ABO and SURF6, P(meta) = 8.57 × 10(-7)) (P<0.05 in all three stages). These results may advance our understanding of genetic susceptibility to EOC.	
25145502	Genome-wide association study of survival in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.	Lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths all over the world. Studies have indicated that molecular biomarkers, including genetic variants, may provide additional values for the targeted treatments and clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients. To better understand the effects of molecular biomarkers on the treatment of NSCLC, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to investigate the prognostic implications of genetic variants in early-stage NSCLC patients with surgery.	
25162662	Genome-wide association study identifies variants in PMS1 associated with serum ferritin in a Chinese population.	Only a small proportion of genetic variation in serum ferritin has been explained by variant genetic studies, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) for serum ferritin has not been investigated widely in Chinese population. We aimed at exploring the novel genetic susceptibility to serum ferritin, and performed this two stage GWAS in a healthy Chinese population of 3,495 men aged 20-69 y, including 1,999 unrelated subjects in the first stage and 1,496 independent individuals in the second stage. Serum ferritin was measured with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, and DNA samples were collected for genotyping. A total of 1,940,243 SNPs were tested by using multivariate linear regression analysis. After adjusting for population stratification, age and BMI, the rs5742933 located in the 5'UTR region of PMS1 gene on chromosome 2 was the most significantly associated with ferritin concentrations (P-combined  = 2.329×10(-10)) (β  =  -0.11, 95% CI: -0.14, -0.07). Moreover, this marker was about 200 kb away from the candidate gene SLC40A1 which is responsible for iron export. PMS1 gene was the novel genetic susceptibility to serum ferritin in Chinese males and its relation to SLC40A1 needs further study.	 19084217 18796516 19417063 19673882 19820698 19820699 19880490 19430479 21208937 22301935 22323359 21739480 22890139 23028341 24066115 24146788 23742704 10630136 10739755 12406098 6572903 3857215 7980603 9609537 15566364 15638857 16862161 16877869 16934002 17333112 17416791 17572673 17701901 17847004 17934319 18537977
25130324	A genome-wide search for quantitative trait loci affecting the cortical surface area and thickness of Heschl's gyrus.	Heschl's gyrus (HG) is a core region of the auditory cortex whose morphology is highly variable across individuals. This variability has been linked to sound perception ability in both speech and music domains. Previous studies show that variations in morphological features of HG, such as cortical surface area and thickness, are heritable. To identify genetic variants that affect HG morphology, we conducted a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) meta-analysis in 3054 healthy individuals using HG surface area and thickness as quantitative traits. None of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed association P values that would survive correction for multiple testing over the genome. The most significant association was found between right HG area and SNP rs72932726 close to gene DCBLD2 (3q12.1; P=2.77 × 10(-7) ). This SNP was also associated with other regions involved in speech processing. The SNP rs333332 within gene KALRN (3q21.2; P=2.27 × 10(-6) ) and rs143000161 near gene COBLL1 (2q24.3; P=2.40 × 10(-6) ) were associated with the area and thickness of left HG, respectively. Both genes are involved in the development of the nervous system. The SNP rs7062395 close to the X-linked deafness gene POU3F4 was associated with right HG thickness (Xq21.1; P=2.38 × 10(-6) ). This is the first molecular genetic analysis of variability in HG morphology.	
25173107	Common variants near ABCA1 and in PMM2 are associated with primary open-angle glaucoma.	We performed a genome-wide association study for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in 1,007 cases with high-pressure glaucoma (HPG) and 1,009 controls from southern China. We observed genome-wide significant association at multiple SNPs near ABCA1 at 9q31.1 (rs2487032; P = 1.66 × 10(-8)) and suggestive evidence of association in PMM2 at 16p13.2 (rs3785176; P = 3.18 × 10(-6)). We replicated these findings in a set of 525 HPG cases and 912 controls from Singapore and a further set of 1,374 POAG cases and 4,053 controls from China. We observed genome-wide significant association with more than one SNP at the two loci (P = 2.79 × 10(-19) for rs2487032 representing ABCA1 and P = 5.77 × 10(-10) for rs3785176 representing PMM2). Both ABCA1 and PMM2 are expressed in the trabecular meshwork, optic nerve and other ocular tissues. In addition, ABCA1 is highly expressed in the ganglion cell layer of the retina, a finding consistent with it having a role in the development of glaucoma.	 21447600 21347282 22419126 22156576 16862161 20395239 9159165 18193043 22001756 21532571 11483617 11719471 15761122 22801829 14597044 20523265 16799014 21383504 19169255 11834836 17478679 9005853 17572673 10431236 19061886 20616382 12384498 12789572 19625618 20970107 20548946 21640322 10196380 17463248 3314502 8432861 19838193 16723468 20835238 17701901 22271762 15723241 22428042 22570617 21562585 9140401 20385819 19150991
25173105	Common variants near ABCA1, AFAP1 and GMDS confer risk of primary open-angle glaucoma.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. We performed a genome-wide association study in an Australian discovery cohort comprising 1,155 cases with advanced POAG and 1,992 controls. We investigated the association of the top SNPs from the discovery stage in two Australian replication cohorts (932 cases and 6,862 controls total) and two US replication cohorts (2,616 cases and 2,634 controls total). Meta-analysis of all cohorts identified three loci newly associated with development of POAG. These loci are located upstream of ABCA1 (rs2472493[G], odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, P = 2.1 × 10(-19)), within AFAP1 (rs4619890[G], OR = 1.20, P = 7.0 × 10(-10)) and within GMDS (rs11969985[G], OR = 1.31, P = 7.7 × 10(-10)). Using RT-PCR and immunolabeling, we show that these genes are expressed within human retina, optic nerve and trabecular meshwork and that ABCA1 and AFAP1 are also expressed in retinal ganglion cells. 	 12134071 11341765 12651883 15085971 8455668 8364574 9005853 10396201 16024915 20702402 20835238 20981092 20517342 21526222 21532571 22064851 22570617 22570627 22542845 22356435 22955989 23376685 23770081 24253303 24316576 24002674 16384967 16488940 16862161 17110915 17554300 17194218 17701901 18218651 19188438 19543373 10666339 20634204 11372538 11405069 12045153 19765683 20548946 20689021 20616382 12365904
25173106	Genome-wide analysis of multi-ancestry cohorts identifies new loci influencing intraocular pressure and susceptibility to glaucoma.	Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor in developing glaucoma, and variability in IOP might herald glaucomatous development or progression. We report the results of a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 18 population cohorts from the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium (IGGC), comprising 35,296 multi-ancestry participants for IOP. We confirm genetic association of known loci for IOP and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and identify four new IOP-associated loci located on chromosome 3q25.31 within the FNDC3B gene (P = 4.19 × 10(-8) for rs6445055), two on chromosome 9 (P = 2.80 × 10(-11) for rs2472493 near ABCA1 and P = 6.39 × 10(-11) for rs8176693 within ABO) and one on chromosome 11p11.2 (best P = 1.04 × 10(-11) for rs747782). Separate meta-analyses of 4 independent POAG cohorts, totaling 4,284 cases and 95,560 controls, showed that 3 of these loci for IOP were also associated with POAG.	 22570627 22941192 23028713 23291589 23088889 24097064 24258680 24002674 10547847 10571352 11315092 12365904 20970107 21058334 21532571 21877163 12111919 12049574 12706378 12958120 14628964 15054401 7444756 8105165 8855394 9097791 9224128 9780094 9869795 15723241 15845033 15965165 15921747 16488940 17254428 17365815 17572673 18300295 19543373 19571811 19763151 19789596 19803772 19995197 20237253 20598278 20150923 20835238 20719862 20932073 20851442

Because the associations with lung disease remain after adjustment for self-reported smoking behaviors, it has been asserted that CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 variants increase COPD and lung cancer susceptibility independently of their effects on smoking.	 21546441 21597399 22039077 22534783 22534784 22306564 22451501 22837378 22524403 22899653 23134971 23299987 10670549 4120148 1164044 6789957 6805589 6866013 3723711 3773954 3806411 2913842 2271019 1932883 16085529 16365017 16436765 17763111 17701901 17194218 18324566 18385738 18385739 18418793 18385676 18626751 18519524 19010884 18974171 19628476 19884613 19760673 19776245 20418888 20418890 20700436 20718045 21278726 21438939 21685187
25186300	Association between antinuclear antibodies and the HLA class II locus and heterogeneous characteristics of staining patterns: the Nagahama study.	While antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are observed in healthy populations as well as in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the detailed genetic background of ANAs has remained unclear. We undertook this study to identify the genetic determinants of ANAs in the general population in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ANA production and to distinguish disease susceptibility genes from ANA production genes.	
25187374	Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies novel variants associated with fasting plasma glucose in East Asians.	Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) has been recognized as an important indicator for the overall glycemic state preceding the onset of metabolic diseases. So far, most indentified genome-wide association loci for FPG were derived from populations with European ancestry, with a few exceptions. To extend a thorough catalog for FPG loci, we conducted meta-analyses of 13 genome-wide association studies in up to 24,740 nondiabetic subjects with East Asian ancestry. Follow-up replication analyses in up to an additional 21,345 participants identified three new FPG loci reaching genome-wide significance in or near PDK1-RAPGEF4, KANK1, and IGF1R. Our results could provide additional insight into the genetic variation implicated in fasting glucose regulation.	 18458160 20179633 12107371 20145256 15331565 17267763 22158537 10471495 23263489 12684185 17315038 19557189 20018033 21909109 22795290 23263486 20368231 22885924 17259557 20498366 18591395 11923875 12647839 19060909 23724904 22581228 20081858

Cardiovascular diseases are among the most significant health problems in the United States. Blood pressure (BP) variability has a genetic component, and most of the genetic variance remains to be identified. One promising strategy for gene discovery is genome-wide analysis of interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental factors related to cardiovascular diseases.	 21909115 20018020 17804423 17384015 2805267 3706114 7731706 15220212 19609347 22494468 9670815 24352519 17315158 19430479 21362509 22209245 20512145 23085811 23598419 23591986 19926856 21045733 19862010 20479774 18991966 17283440 19268276 23966867 24347668 23761489 15882546 19812666 18714356 19430483 20212493 17701901 22716474 18348202 7731705 22760307 22581228 7795214 8937855 11679404
25187353	Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis is associated with rare HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B alleles.	Clozapine is a particularly effective antipsychotic medication but its use is curtailed by the risk of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis/granulocytopenia (CIAG), a severe adverse drug reaction occurring in up to 1% of treated individuals. Identifying genetic risk factors for CIAG could enable safer and more widespread use of clozapine. Here we perform the largest and most comprehensive genetic study of CIAG to date by interrogating 163 cases using genome-wide genotyping and whole-exome sequencing. We find that two loci in the major histocompatibility complex are independently associated with CIAG: a single amino acid in HLA-DQB1 (126Q) (P=4.7 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR)=0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.12-0.29) and an amino acid change in the extracellular binding pocket of HLA-B (158T) (P=6.4 × 10(-10), OR=3.3, 95% CI=2.3-4.9). These associations dovetail with the roles of these genes in immunogenetic phenotypes and adverse drug responses for other medications, and provide insight into the pathophysiology of CIAG. 	 23269371 23352160 23364395 23762245 23817571 24036952 23918589 23752246 24759409 23326239 20562413 20981092 21048700 21478889 20868635 21750111 21983784 22138821 22722860 22820512 22907657 22843986 23080122 11146763 15057820 3046553 2222133 8515788 7620171 9587740 15297300 16862161 17701901 17001352 18317468 19200528 19483685 19451168 19505943 20354512
25188341	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a major public health challenge and present a therapeutic imperative for which we need additional insight into molecular pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias. 	 8427562 20616382 20885792 20697030 21460840 21460841 21825242 23128226 22869155 23407718 23550670 23565137 23836404 24162737 24336208 24439484 1759558 11368158 8346443 7750518 9329452 16862161 17572673 17387528 17701901 12528816 17879383 20083042

25442119	Second-generation Irish genome-wide association study for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heritable neurological disease for which the underlying genetic etiology is only partially understood. In Ireland, 83%-90% of cases are currently unexplained. Through large international collaborations, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have succeeded in identifying a number of genomic loci that contribute toward ALS risk and age at onset. However, for the large proportion of risk that remains unexplained, population specificity of pathogenic variants could interfere with the detection of disease-associated loci. Single-population studies are therefore an important complement to larger international collaborations. In this study, we conduct a GWAS for ALS risk and age at onset in a large Irish ALS case-control cohort, using genome-wide imputation to increase marker density. Despite being adequately powered to detect associations of modest effect size, the study did not identify any locus associated with ALS risk or age at onset above the genome-wide significance threshold. Several speculative associations were, however, identified at loci that have been previously implicated in ALS. The lack of any clear association supports the conclusion that ALS is likely to be caused by multiple rare genetic risk factors. The findings of the present study highlight the importance of ongoing genetic research into the cause of ALS and its likely future challenges. 	
25194280	Genome-wide association study identifies three susceptibility loci for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in the Chinese population.	To identify genetic markers for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 993 individuals with LSCC (cases) and 1,995 cancer-free controls from Chinese populations. The most promising variants (association P < 1 × 10(-5)) were then replicated in 3 independent sets including 2,398 cases and 2,804 controls, among which we identified 3 new susceptibility loci at 11q12 (rs174549), 6p21 (rs2857595) and 12q24 (rs10492336). The minor alleles of each of these loci showed protective effects, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.73 (0.68-0.78; P = 1.00 × 10(-20)), 0.78 (0.72-0.84; P = 2.43 × 10(-15)) and 0.71 (0.65-0.77; P = 4.48 × 10(-14)), respectively. None of these variants showed an interaction with smoking or drinking. This is the first GWAS to our knowledge solely on LSCC, and the findings might advance understanding of the etiology of LSCC.	 21744095 18193044 19043545 23504502 18193043 21642993 19618370 23139255 23128233 22253303 23175764 20686565 22072618 20802524 21102463 22158540 23245941 19060911 21437268 22936669 18500343 8988165 17505073 20062060 21351269 23703970 17589521 21076409 20662065 20062063 19060906 16670158 22960999 19060910
25201988	Common genetic variants associated with cognitive performance identified using the proxy-phenotype method.	We identify common genetic variants associated with cognitive performance using a two-stage approach, which we call the proxy-phenotype method. First, we conduct a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in a large sample (n = 106,736), which produces a set of 69 education-associated SNPs. Second, using independent samples (n = 24,189), we measure the association of these education-associated SNPs with cognitive performance. Three SNPs (rs1487441, rs7923609, and rs2721173) are significantly associated with cognitive performance after correction for multiple hypothesis testing. In an independent sample of older Americans (n = 8,652), we also show that a polygenic score derived from the education-associated SNPs is associated with memory and absence of dementia. Convergent evidence from a set of bioinformatics analyses implicates four specific genes (KNCMA1, NRXN1, POU2F3, and SCRT). All of these genes are associated with a particular neurotransmitter pathway involved in synaptic plasticity, the main cellular mechanism for learning and memory. 	 16862161 19019849 23358156 20881960 20935630 15685427 19768548 23012269 19285755 24944428 21826061 24162737 23722424 23207651 22243964 24763738 22700061 24399044 24352232 12486697

25208887	Genetic variants in PLG, LPA, and SIGLEC 14 as well as smoking contribute to plasma plasminogen levels.	Plasminogen is the precursor of the serine protease plasmin, a central enzyme of the fibrinolytic system. Plasma levels of plasminogen vary by almost 2-fold among healthy individuals, yet little is known about its heritability or genetic determinants in the general population. In order to identify genetic factors affecting the natural variation of plasminogen levels, we performed a genome-wide association study and linkage analysis in a sample of 3456 young healthy individuals who participated in the Genes and Blood Clotting Study (GABC) or the Trinity Student Study (TSS). Heritability of plasminogen levels was 48.1% to 60.0%. Tobacco smoking and female sex were associated with higher levels of plasminogen. In the meta-analysis, 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2 regions reached genome-wide significance (P < 5.0E-8). Of these, 9 SNPs were near the PLG or LPA genes on Chr6q26, whereas 2 were on Chr19q13 and 5' upstream of SIGLEC14. These 11 SNPs represented 4 independent signals and collectively explained 6.8% of plasminogen level variation in the study populations. The strongest association was observed for a nonsynonymous SNP in the PLG gene (R523W). Individuals bearing an additional copy of this allele had an average decrease of 13.4% in plasma plasminogen level. 	 21900290 20208533 22689647 22733016 22990020 23300722 20354512 20413657 20686565 20616382 20634204 20965889 21127300 21167468 21163921 21765920 21653798 21893624 22003918 23267103 23401155 23685556 23519826 24009290 24578379 22563086 10747348 11246457 11304480 11731797 11855950 12355401 3670400 3127309 1386087 8612226 9255907 9971870 15613028 17012248 17701901 17900274 18324572 18478967 18560491 19085655 19124843 19369701 20032323 20040588

Replication of significantly associated genes from previous GWASs was found for both ages. Genome-wide significant associations were found both at age 6 and 14 with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 11p15 in PDE3B/CYP2R1 (age 6: rs1007392, P=3.9 × 10(-8); age14: rs11023332, P=2.2 × 10(-10)) and on chromosome 4q13 in GC (age 6: rs17467825, P=4.2 × 10(-9); age14: rs1155563; P=3.9 × 10(-9)). In addition, a novel association was observed at age 6 with SNPs on chromosome 7p15 near NPY (age 6: rs156299, P=1.3 × 10(-6)) that could be of functional interest in highlighting alternative pathways for vitamin D metabolism in this age group and merits further analysis in other cohort studies. 	 8105165 16862161 22708765 20681986 22168576 22253303 12359508 22673963 20600896 24119980 10834935 21565922 14592784 15070933 19389886 23114382 20233392 20418485 15465040 22528806 21058334 20634204 17701901 20397196 16020493 17656603 22509879 17426912 22945547 20202858 20541252 20972986

Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are the most prescribed class of lipid-lowering drugs for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

25223841	A genetic locus in 7p12.2 associated with treatment resistant schizophrenia.	Approximately 30% of patients with schizophrenia are treatment resistant (TRS), i.e. have persistent psychotic symptoms despite adequate trials of at least two antipsychotic drugs (APDs). Most TRS patients are candidates for clozapine treatment which is underutilized because of its side effects and difficulty in identifying TRS. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 79 TRS and 95 non-treatment resistant (NTRS) Caucasian schizophrenia patients to identify possible biomarkers for TRS, which might also provide insight into the pathobiology of TRS. The single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2237457, located in 7p12.2, a region reported to have imprinted inheritance, was found to have the lowest p value in an allelic association test (unadjusted p = 5.53 × 10(-6)). Haploview disclosed a 30 kb block flanking this SNP within GRB10, 70 kb upstream of l-dopa decarboxylase (DDC), an enzyme which is rate-limiting in the synthesis of trace amines and neurotransmitters implicated in schizophrenia and the action of APDs. This SNP or haplotype was identified as an exclusive cis-acting eQTL for DDC in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by BrainCloud®. A replication sample genotyped for this SNP produced a weaker result, but in the same direction. After combining the two samples, rs2237457 remained significantly associated with TRS (unadjusted p = 5.66 × 10(-7) in recessive mode; 9.42 × 10(-5) in allelic association). If replicated in an independent sample, rs2237457 may provide a biomarker to identify a significant proportion of Caucasian TRS. The results implicate trace amines and their synthesis in the pathophysiology of TRS.	
25217961	A meta-analysis of 87,040 individuals identifies 23 new susceptibility loci for prostate cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 76 variants associated with prostate cancer risk predominantly in populations of European ancestry. To identify additional susceptibility loci for this common cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of > 10 million SNPs in 43,303 prostate cancer cases and 43,737 controls from studies in populations of European, African, Japanese and Latino ancestry. Twenty-three new susceptibility loci were identified at association P < 5 × 10(-8); 15 variants were identified among men of European ancestry, 7 were identified in multi-ancestry analyses and 1 was associated with early-onset prostate cancer. These 23 variants, in combination with known prostate cancer risk variants, explain 33% of the familial risk for this disease in European-ancestry populations. These findings provide new regions for investigation into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and demonstrate the usefulness of combining ancestrally diverse populations to discover risk loci for disease.	 24296704 23260764 24185611 24497837 12475199 12582260 12925520 2664509 7987387 17527075 18073375 23374354 23535729 23535732 18274524 18264096 18264097 18519769 18422767 18543251 19117981 19543373 19578363 19578365 19578366 19578367 19767754 19787211 19855435 19937461 20233392 20453838 20562874 20616382 20676098 21602798 21637779 21572438 21743057 21969603 22083957 22366784 22718787 22955990 22955617 22684628 22899653 22923026
25217962	HLA-DQA1-HLA-DRB1 variants confer susceptibility to pancreatitis induced by thiopurine immunosuppressants.	Pancreatitis occurs in approximately 4% of patients treated with the thiopurines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Its development is unpredictable and almost always leads to drug withdrawal. We identified patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who had developed pancreatitis within 3 months of starting these drugs from 168 sites around the world. After detailed case adjudication, we performed a genome-wide association study on 172 cases and 2,035 controls with IBD. We identified strong evidence of association within the class II HLA region, with the most significant association identified at rs2647087 (odds ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 2.07-3.26, P = 2 × 10(-16)). We replicated these findings in an independent set of 78 cases and 472 controls with IBD matched for drug exposure. Fine mapping of the HLA region identified association with the HLA-DQA1*02:01-HLA-DRB1*07:01 haplotype. Patients heterozygous at rs2647087 have a 9% risk of developing pancreatitis after administration of a thiopurine, whereas homozygotes have a 17% risk.	 19160175 21297633 5029069 24464277 19399780 21778381 23762245 19915572 22820512 22722860 17395548 23644079 5326140 23665964 23141566 22972046 19483685 12083399 18587394 18256392 19499576 21058334 17554300 17505501 11910336 22843986 17701901 20981092 21167468 21245432 22194808 15167706 20926424 24190431 15317038
25224454	Genome-wide admixture and association study of serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity in African Americans.	Iron is an essential component of many important proteins and enzymes, including hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen to the cells. African Americans (AAs) have a greater prevalence of iron deficiency compared with European Americans. We conducted genome-wide admixture-mapping and association studies for serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (SAT) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in 2347 AAs participating in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Follow-up replication analyses for JHS iron-trait associated SNPs were conducted in 329 AA participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS). Higher estimated proportions of global African ancestry were significantly associated with lower levels of iron (P = 2.4 × 10(-5)), SAT (P = 0.0019) and TIBC (P = 0.042). We observed significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) between serum TIBC levels and two independent SNPs around TF on chromosome 3, the first report of a genome-wide significant second independent signal in this region, and SNPs near two novel genes: HDGFL1 on chromosome 6 and MAF on chromosome 16. We also observed significant associations between ferritin levels and SNPs near GAB3 on chromosome X. We replicated our two independent associations at TF and our association at GAB3 in HANDLS. Our study provides evidence for both shared and unique genetic risk factors that are associated with iron-related measures in AAs. The top two variants in TF explain 11.2% of the total variation in TIBC levels in AAs after accounting for age, gender, body mass index and background ancestry. 	 21063220 21058334 21153663 21208937 21665994 21785125 22761678 22820512 23446634 11772997 12614223 12811229 15088269 3451411 15790781 16210711 16317981 16317983 16470690 16862161 16877869 17014365 17572344 17355169 17701901 17903294 17903303 19084217 19148283 19197348 19875614 19820699 19648217 20634204 20828101 21149283

25226531	Common variation near ROBO2 is associated with expressive vocabulary in infancy.	Twin studies suggest that expressive vocabulary at ~24 months is modestly heritable. However, the genes influencing this early linguistic phenotype are unknown. Here we conduct a genome-wide screen and follow-up study of expressive vocabulary in toddlers of European descent from up to four studies of the EArly Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology consortium, analysing an early (15-18 months, 'one-word stage', N(Total) = 8,889) and a later (24-30 months, 'two-word stage', N(Total)=10,819) phase of language acquisition. For the early phase, one single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs7642482) at 3p12.3 near ROBO2, encoding a conserved axon-binding receptor, reaches the genome-wide significance level (P=1.3 × 10(-8)) in the combined sample. This association links language-related common genetic variation in the general population to a potential autism susceptibility locus and a linkage region for dyslexia, speech-sound disorder and reading. The contribution of common genetic influences is, although modest, supported by genome-wide complex trait analysis (meta-GCTA h(2)(15-18-months) = 0.13, meta-GCTA h(2)(24-30-months) = 0.14) and in concordance with additional twin analysis (5,733 pairs of European descent, h(2)(24-months) = 0.20).	 23083737 22331874 2811339 11315092 16862161 20949370 20562875 18055773 18270976 22064851 2925817 7845413 17572673 11584043 21106759 22955616 11324663 11743577 22843982 12139432 23255150 17392456 23110994 21859478 11089341 15091338 10599625 8461134 18278043 17982457 24687471 21058334 21152010 18839484 24612512 19295514 17701901 9458045 23884932 10195167 24487584 9185344 18588717 16254601 21441907 22171328 23275889 14740317 23738518 22356179
25240745	A genome-wide association study in the genetic analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia project suggests sex-specific regulation of mitochondrial DNA levels.	Identifying genes that regulate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels is of interest due to an increasing number of diseases in humans that are associated with altered mtDNA levels. We searched for nuclear polymorphisms that influence mtDNA levels using a family-based genome-wide association (GWAS) method. Also, our aim was to determine if sex influences the genetic control of mtDNA levels. Two intron-polymorphisms, in the genes PARK2 and MRPL37, showed a tendency toward an association with mtDNA levels only in females and only in males, respectively. Both genes have a role in mitochondrial biogenesis and are potential candidates for the sex-specific control of mtDNA levels. 	
25233373	Genome-wide meta-analysis of myopia and hyperopia provides evidence for replication of 11 loci.	Refractive error (RE) is a complex, multifactorial disorder characterized by a mismatch between the optical power of the eye and its axial length that causes object images to be focused off the retina. The two major subtypes of RE are myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness), which represent opposite ends of the distribution of the quantitative measure of spherical refraction. We performed a fixed effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association results of myopia and hyperopia from 9 studies of European-derived populations: AREDS, KORA, FES, OGP-Talana, MESA, RSI, RSII, RSIII and ERF. One genome-wide significant region was observed for myopia, corresponding to a previously identified myopia locus on 8q12 (p = 1.25×10(-8)), which has been reported by Kiefer et al. as significantly associated with myopia age at onset and Verhoeven et al. as significantly associated to mean spherical-equivalent (MSE) refractive error. We observed two genome-wide significant associations with hyperopia. These regions overlapped with loci on 15q14 (minimum p value = 9.11×10(-11)) and 8q12 (minimum p value 1.82×10(-11)) previously reported for MSE and myopia age at onset. We also used an intermarker linkage- disequilibrium-based method for calculating the effective number of tests in targeted regional replication analyses. We analyzed myopia (which represents the closest phenotype in our data to the one used by Kiefer et al.) and showed replication of 10 additional loci associated with myopia previously reported by Kiefer et al. This is the first replication of these loci using myopia as the trait under analysis. "Replication-level" association was also seen between hyperopia and 12 of Kiefer et al.'s published loci. For the loci that show evidence of association to both myopia and hyperopia, the estimated effect of the risk alleles were in opposite directions for the two traits. This suggests that these loci are important contributors to variation of refractive error across the distribution.	 22879416 11315092 19211608 18579757 23468642 18193045 20835239 18193043 18469186 19900831 15008558 3049225 15008559 10787416 21795522 23838769 2392890 11737681 20560208 23647423 19074959 21990100 17966091 21155761 18300295 22444669 18252219 15078666 19373277 17236140 16077740 20616382 17724179 18976480 22665138 14985292 23396134 23593034 16400608 20598278 15851555 22135213 17551261 21403850 20454541 18294691 17701901 14997420 21188353 23474815 20008719 17849491 20851442 11678987 17410554
25234806	Dissecting the genetics of chronic mucus hypersecretion in smokers with and without COPD.	Smoking is a notorious risk factor for chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH). CMH frequently occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The question arises whether the same single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are related to CMH in smokers with and without COPD. We performed two genome-wide association studies of CMH under an additive genetic model in male heavy smokers (≥20 pack-years) with COPD (n=849, 39.9% CMH) and without COPD (n=1348, 25.4% CMH), followed by replication and meta-analysis in comparable populations, and assessment of the functional relevance of significantly associated SNPs. Genome-wide association analysis of CMH in COPD and non-COPD subjects yielded no genome-wide significance after replication. In COPD, our top SNP (rs10461985, p=5.43×10(-5)) was located in the GDNF-AS1 gene that is functionally associated with the GDNF gene. Expression of GDNF in bronchial biopsies of COPD patients was significantly associated with CMH (p=0.007). In non-COPD subjects, four SNPs had a p-value <10(-5) in the meta-analysis, including a SNP (rs4863687) in the MAML3 gene, the T-allele showing modest association with CMH (p=7.57×10(-6), OR 1.48) and with significantly increased MAML3 expression in lung tissue (p=2.59×10(-12)). Our data suggest the potential for differential genetic backgrounds of CMH in individuals with and without COPD. 	 22282547 12568485 23204254 23925644 24714607 12200518 14600005 8499054 7672054 9620904 10228554 15731568 15959515 16281659 17701901 18048810 18216052 19386687 19841453 19955524 19854293 20214461 20831787 21672193 22069191 22080838 22345578 11919078 24642640 12397006 23209423

25241763	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies novel loci that influence cupping and the glaucomatous process.	Glaucoma is characterized by irreversible optic nerve degeneration and is the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Here, the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium conducts a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR), an important disease-related optic nerve parameter. In 21,094 individuals of European ancestry and 6,784 individuals of Asian ancestry, we identify 10 new loci associated with variation in VCDR. In a separate risk-score analysis of five case-control studies, Caucasians in the highest quintile have a 2.5-fold increased risk of primary open-angle glaucoma as compared with those in the lowest quintile. This study has more than doubled the known loci associated with optic disc cupping and will allow greater understanding of mechanisms involved in this common blinding condition. 	 12748967 12111919 20548946 20237253 20562875 20598278 20616382 20634204 20851442 21058334 21139683 21167468 21379321 21397060 21307088 21526222 21427129 21961509 21872936 23291589 23218692 23396134 23422823 15094112 14691154 25173106 1406996 9152133 15939473 16488940 17572673 19279343 19180575 19458335 20395239 10577657 11022047 11909549 12032072 12045153 14643374

25249183	Genome-wide association study in Chinese identifies novel loci for blood pressure and hypertension.	Hypertension is a common disorder and the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature deaths worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the European population have identified multiple chromosomal regions associated with blood pressure, and the identified loci altogether explain only a small fraction of the variance for blood pressure. The differences in environmental exposures and genetic background between Chinese and European populations might suggest potential different pathways of blood pressure regulation. To identify novel genetic variants affecting blood pressure variation, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWASs of blood pressure and hypertension in 11 816 subjects followed by replication studies including 69 146 additional individuals. We identified genome-wide significant (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) associations with blood pressure, which included variants at three new loci (CACNA1D, CYP21A2, and MED13L) and a newly discovered variant near SLC4A7. We also replicated 14 previously reported loci, 8 (CASZ1, MOV10, FGF5, CYP17A1, SOX6, ATP2B1, ALDH2, and JAG1) at genome-wide significance, and 6 (FIGN, ULK4, GUCY1A3, HFE, TBX3-TBX5, and TBX3) at a suggestive level of P = 1.81 × 10(-3) to 5.16 × 10(-8). These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation of blood pressure and potential targets for treatments.	 17572673 17443206 17873874 18462017 19106390 19034521 19557189 19644074 20485568 20714348 20616382 19430479 19430483 21058334 21304890 21572416 21725308 12377087 12468580 14638541 8733045 15539633 15557390 15652604 15836888 17466231 21909115 22100073 22532805 22941192 22249253 23303523 22531126 23913001 23972371

25256182	Genome-wide association study of intracranial aneurysm identifies a new association on chromosome 7.	Common variants have been identified using genome-wide association studies which contribute to intracranial aneurysms (IA) susceptibility. However, it is clear that the variants identified to date do not account for the estimated genetic contribution to disease risk.	 22306652 21735171 22961961 23733552 1738378 7633233 7666217 8839125 9033463 10397113 10470812 16251536 16862161 17434096 18176561 17470467 17568781 18794855 18997786 19501022 19715440 19910543 20364137 20190001 20616382 21641282 22106312 23041239
25303641	Genome-wide association study identifies ITPR2 as a susceptibility gene for Kashin-Beck disease in Han Chinese.	Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic osteochondropathy, the pathogenesis of which remains elusive.

25256105	Genome-wide exploration identifies sex-specific genetic effects of alleles upstream NPY to increase the risk of severe periodontitis in men.	Periodontitis (PD) is influenced by genetic as well as lifestyle and socio-economic factors. Epidemiological studies show that men are at greater risk of severe forms of PD, suggesting interplay between sex and genetic factors. We aimed to systematically analyse patients with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) for gene-sex interactions.	
25261932	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for diffuse large B cell lymphoma.	Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma subtype and is clinically aggressive. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for DLBCL, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3 new genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 1 previous scan, totaling 3,857 cases and 7,666 controls of European ancestry, with additional genotyping of 9 promising SNPs in 1,359 cases and 4,557 controls. In our multi-stage analysis, five independent SNPs in four loci achieved genome-wide significance marked by rs116446171 at 6p25.3 (EXOC2; P = 2.33 × 10(-21)), rs2523607 at 6p21.33 (HLA-B; P = 2.40 × 10(-10)), rs79480871 at 2p23.3 (NCOA1; P = 4.23 × 10(-8)) and two independent SNPs, rs13255292 and rs4733601, at 8q24.21 (PVT1; P = 9.98 × 10(-13) and 3.63 × 10(-11), respectively). These data provide substantial new evidence for genetic susceptibility to this B cell malignancy and point to pathways involved in immune recognition and immune function in the pathogenesis of DLBCL. 	 17185468 17389762 17701901 17873877 18219307 18758461 19390683 19543373 23770605 23936226 23782616 23830877 24004450 19438470 19620980 19704118 3024964 8116619 20047977 20062064 20145037 20385791 20562875 20639881 20856902 20981092 21030533 20699439 21037568 21167468 21376301 21533074 21441907 21471979 21804550 21743057 22064851 22200770 22350582 22534017 23143597 22976474 23335087 23349640 23762245 23749188 10835412 11748279 14704198 15184900 15342541 7481822 10319267 16862161 17018274 17060358 17234637
25266886	Common variants in the CRP promoter are associated with a high C-reactive protein level in Kawasaki disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting form of vasculitis that afflicts infants and children and manifests as fever and signs of mucocutaneous inflammation. Children with KD show various laboratory inflammatory abnormalities, such as elevations in their white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We here performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 178 KD patients to identify the genetic loci that influence 10 important KD laboratory markers: WBC count, neutrophil count, platelet count, CRP, ESR, hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, and total protein. A total of 165 loci passed our arbitrary stage 1 threshold for replication (p < 1 × 10(-5)). Of these, only 2 SNPs (rs12068753 and rs4786091) demonstrated a significant association with the CRP level in replication study of 473 KD patients (p < 0.05). The SNP located at the CRP locus (rs12068753) demonstrated the most significant association with CRP in KD patients (beta = 4.73 and p = 1.20 × 10(-6) according to the stage 1 GWAS; beta = 3.65 and p = 1.35 × 10(-8) according to the replication study; beta = 3.97 and p = 1.11 × 10(-13) according to combined analysis) and explained 8.1% of the phenotypic variation observed. However, this SNP did not demonstrate any significant association with CRP in the general population (beta = 0.37 and p = 0.1732) and only explained 0.1% of the phenotypic variation in this instance. Furthermore, rs12068753 did not affect the development of coronary artery lesions or intravenous immunoglobulin resistance in KD patients. These results indicate that common variants in the CRP promoter can play an important role in the CRP levels in KD.	 22446962 18464913 22081228 18439548 8491037 2019921 11679405 21647738 22291609 21196492 9605052 15302199 17903293 18439552 22158537 22446961 18579810 9887164 12457252 11059532 17701901 10931408 1801561 15505111 21221998 19567438 3950818 22492993
25317112	Epidemiological and genome-wide association study of gastritis or gastric ulcer in korean populations.	Gastritis is a major disease that has the potential to grow as gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is a very common cancer, and it is related to a very high mortality rate in Korea. This disease is known to have various reasons, including infection with Helicobacter pylori, dietary habits, tobacco, and alcohol. The incidence rate of gastritis has reported to differ between age, population, and gender. However, unlike other factors, there has been no analysis based on gender. So, we examined the high risk factors of gastritis in each gender in the Korean population by focusing on sex. We performed an analysis of 120 clinical characteristics and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 349,184 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the results of Anseong and Ansan cohort study in the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project. As the result, we could not prove a strong relation with these factors and gastritis or gastric ulcer in the GWAS. However, we confirmed several already-known risk factors and also found some differences of clinical characteristics in each gender using logistic regression. As a result of the logistic regression, a relation with hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia therapy, hypotensive or antihypotensive drug, diastolic blood pressure, and gastritis was seen in males; the results of this study suggest that vascular disease has a potential association with gastritis in males. 	 16997150 23613665 1501650 20490314 22865192 22363117 8125567 2205940 3379219 16489633 4718952 20937632 22825588 17701901 21731209 19396169 9130183
25317111	Genome-wide association study of medication adherence in chronic diseases in the korean population.	Medication adherence is generally defined as the extent of voluntary cooperation of a patient in taking medicine as prescribed. Adherence to long-term treatment with chronic disease is essential for reducing disease comorbidity and mortality. However, medication non-adherence in chronic disease averages 50%. This study was conducted a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic basis of medication adherence. A total of 235 medication non-adherents and 1,067 medication adherents with hypertension or diabetes were used from the Korean Association Resource project data according to the self-reported treatment status of each chronic disease, respectively. We identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms with suggestive genome-wide association. The most significant single nucleotide polymorphism was rs6978712 (chromosome 7, p = 4.87 × 10(-7)), which is located proximal to the GCC1 gene, which was previously implicated in decision-making capability in drug abusers. Two suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2) > 0.8) with rs6978712. Thus, in the aspect of decision-making in adherence behavior, the association between medication adherence and three loci proximal to the GCC1 gene seems worthy of further research. However, to overcome a few limitations in this study, defining the standardized phenotype criteria for self-reported adherence should be performed before replicating association studies. 	 18728716 18363527 10209125 21226789 24851043 18349094 23300413 16079372 23903073 21464898 18453793 17205118 22083729 20634204 17701901 19396169 18957941
25534755	A genome-wide association study of autism using the Simons Simplex Collection: Does reducing phenotypic heterogeneity in autism increase genetic homogeneity?	Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has not been tested. Our study examines the impact of subphenotyping of a well-characterized autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.	 14699429 24468882 21484201 17276746 19373549 16530042 23974872 7161234 19207624 22176938 23776040 20862653 23067556 12567325 17619129 25056061 17322880 25086666 18391219 19812673 21182207 21827743 20556500 22065253 22095612 11840513 18571142 20955926 23431162 23966166 23776205 24344280 23143131 21926974 14532331 20844286 22843504 10508514 21091464 20655035 20410716 11565034 24373520 18787170 21078308 25038753 19571808 15640147 20644553 18632090 22542183 23065116 24577245 24089385 7792363 24463508 22862778 19082876 21703496 21658581 21167468 11353400 17389905 11055368 11443542 20678246 19571811 19933162 22123952 14726723 20935640 20531469 24352232
25271088	Gene by stress genome-wide interaction analysis and path analysis identify EBF1 as a cardiovascular and metabolic risk gene.	We performed gene-environment interaction genome-wide association analysis (G × E GWAS) to identify SNPs whose effects on metabolic traits are modified by chronic psychosocial stress in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In Whites, the G × E GWAS for hip circumference identified five SNPs within the Early B-cell Factor 1 (EBF1) gene, all of which were in strong linkage disequilibrium. The gene-by-stress interaction (SNP × STRESS) term P-values were genome-wide significant (Ps = 7.14E-09 to 2.33E-08, uncorrected; Ps = 1.99E-07 to 5.18E-07, corrected for genomic control). The SNP-only (without interaction) model P-values (Ps = 0.011-0.022) were not significant at the conventional genome-wide significance level. Further analysis of related phenotypes identified gene-by-stress interaction effects for waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, type II diabetes status, and common carotid intimal-medial thickness (CCIMT), supporting a proposed model of gene-by-stress interaction that connects cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor endophenotypes such as central obesity and increased blood glucose or diabetes to CVD itself. Structural equation path analysis suggested that the path from chronic psychosocial stress to CCIMT via hip circumference and fasting glucose was larger (estimate = 0.26, P = 0.033, 95% CI = 0.02-0.49) in the EBF1 rs4704963 CT/CC genotypes group than the same path in the TT group (estimate = 0.004, P = 0.34, 95% CI = -0.004-0.012). We replicated the association of the EBF1 SNPs and hip circumference in the Framingham Offspring Cohort (gene-by-stress term P-values = 0.007-0.012) as well as identified similar path relationships. This observed and replicated interaction between psychosocial stress and variation in the EBF1 gene may provide a biological hypothesis for the complex relationship between psychosocial stress, central obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.	 15807228 12397006 16862161 16880826 17044848 17060461 17242284 17701901 17716037 18722139 19372593 20172967 20935630 21378990 20212493 21909110 21909115 22369142 22581228 22444201 22738239 22885922 23239837 12629534 23539213 15272420 15364186 15514657 1208363 1415137 1415138 9193195 15803198 16464173

25279986	Genome-wide association study identifies five susceptibility loci for follicular lymphoma outside the HLA region.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of follicular lymphoma (FL) have previously identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants. To identify additional FL susceptibility loci, we conducted a large-scale two-stage GWAS in 4,523 case subjects and 13,344 control subjects of European ancestry. Five non-HLA loci were associated with FL risk: 11q23.3 (rs4938573, p = 5.79 × 10(-20)) near CXCR5; 11q24.3 (rs4937362, p = 6.76 × 10(-11)) near ETS1; 3q28 (rs6444305, p = 1.10 × 10(-10)) in LPP; 18q21.33 (rs17749561, p = 8.28 × 10(-10)) near BCL2; and 8q24.21 (rs13254990, p = 1.06 × 10(-8)) near PVT1. In an analysis of the HLA region, we identified four linked HLA-DRβ1 multiallelic amino acids at positions 11, 13, 28, and 30 that were associated with FL risk (pomnibus = 4.20 × 10(-67) to 2.67 × 10(-70)). Additional independent signals included rs17203612 in HLA class II (odds ratio [OR(per-allele)] = 1.44; p = 4.59 × 10(-16)) and rs3130437 in HLA class I (OR(per-allele) = 1.23; p = 8.23 × 10(-9)). Our findings further expand the number of loci associated with FL and provide evidence that multiple common variants outside the HLA region make a significant contribution to FL risk.	 12697658 8145819 10424743 17701901 19543373 19620980 20143317 20385791 20639881 20981092 21533074 21441907 22064851 22200770 22296171 22955616 23025665 23246294 23349640 23762245 23791106 23777769 23782616 23897955 24304973
25281659	A novel common variant in DCST2 is associated with length in early life and height in adulthood.	Common genetic variants have been identified for adult height, but not much is known about the genetics of skeletal growth in early life. To identify common genetic variants that influence fetal skeletal growth, we meta-analyzed 22 genome-wide association studies (Stage 1; N = 28 459). We identified seven independent top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 1 × 10(-6)) for birth length, of which three were novel and four were in or near loci known to be associated with adult height (LCORL, PTCH1, GPR126 and HMGA2). The three novel SNPs were followed-up in nine replication studies (Stage 2; N = 11 995), with rs905938 in DC-STAMP domain containing 2 (DCST2) genome-wide significantly associated with birth length in a joint analysis (Stages 1 + 2; β = 0.046, SE = 0.008, P = 2.46 × 10(-8), explained variance = 0.05%). Rs905938 was also associated with infant length (N = 28 228; P = 5.54 × 10(-4)) and adult height (N = 127 513; P = 1.45 × 10(-5)). DCST2 is a DC-STAMP-like protein family member and DC-STAMP is an osteoclast cell-fusion regulator. Polygenic scores based on 180 SNPs previously associated with human adult stature explained 0.13% of variance in birth length. The same SNPs explained 2.95% of the variance of infant length. Of the 180 known adult height loci, 11 were genome-wide significantly associated with infant length (SF3B4, LCORL, SPAG17, C6orf173, PTCH1, GDF5, ZNFX1, HHIP, ACAN, HLA locus and HMGA2). This study highlights that common variation in DCST2 influences variation in early growth and adult height. 	 10649495 10770310 10802651 11315092 14657428 15452179 8857020 9461614 9620819 16061724 17030683 17344885 17572673 17701901 18391952 18952287 19584346 19696694 19700477 19846850 20233392 20372150 20581827 20616382 20881960 21058334 21067998 21801086 21757498 22064851 22080510 22187427 22504418 22504419 22848364 23086283 23202124 23154084 23345460 23588557 23699752 25108383 25282103 23563608
25281661	Genome-wide association study identified SNP on 15q24 associated with bladder cancer risk in Japanese population.	Through genome-wide association analysis and an independent replication study using a total of 1131 bladder cancer cases and 12 558 non-cancer controls of Japanese populations, we identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 15q24. SNP rs11543198 was associated with bladder cancer risk with odds ratio (OR) of 1.41 and P-value of 4.03 × 10(-9). Subgroup analysis revealed rs11543198 to have a stronger effect in male smokers with OR of 1.66. SNP rs8041357, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1) with rs11543198, was also associated with bladder cancer risk in Europeans (P = 0.045 for an additive and P = 0.025 for a recessive model), despite much lower minor allele frequency in Europeans (3.7%) compared with the Japanese (22.2%). Imputational analysis in this region suggested CYP1A2, which metabolizes tobacco-derived carcinogen, as a causative candidate gene. We also confirmed the association of previously reported loci, namely SLC14A1, APOBEC3A, PSCA and MYC, with bladder cancer. Our finding implies the crucial roles of genetic variations on the chemically associated development of bladder cancer. 	 21296855 20981092 21750109 21824976 22416122 22387998 22820512 23462460 23803095 23628800 24155119 24163127 24293373 24740636 10551315 10713670 11287448 11857419 12351146 14689225 14750529 15456989 15489140 2893213 3329634 1934275 8261468 8296317 7920209 7728097 7757072 9288885 10101295 15297300 16112301 16728505 16862161 16906435 17463248 17684133 18052394 19369583 19648920 20139978 20972438 21846855
25282103	Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height.	Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs explained ∼21%, ∼24% and ∼29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/β-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants. 	 21167468 21552263 21407268 21892160 22080510 22426310 22876189 22914739 23563608 24385918 24762786 16565746 14624724 25108383 16862161 17344885 17701901 18443579 19369660 19557189 19836009 20208533 20562875 20714348 20616382 20811451 20881960 21129727 21129728 21067998
25288136	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies six novel loci associated with habitual coffee consumption.	Coffee, a major dietary source of caffeine, is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has received considerable attention regarding health risks and benefits. We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91,462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in ~30 062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log10Bayes factor (BF)>5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5 × 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.	 23022100 22754043 22656382 22442142 22426310 21441907 21471458 21357676 23966204 20619336 23047293 21876539 23353702 23493553 11796742 12181566 12213385 12553913 10049999 17726476 18619574 19590847 19763151 19643913 20017110 19802894 20418890 20509871 20532872 20714348 20616382 20675712 21167468 23988118 21490707 24816252 23492908

25297839	Genetic variation in the HLA region is associated with susceptibility to herpes zoster.	Herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV initially manifests as chicken pox, most commonly in childhood, can remain asymptomatically latent in nerve tissues for many years and often re-emerges as shingles. Although reactivation may be related to immune suppression, aging and female sex, most inter-individual variability in re-emergence risk has not been explained to date. We performed a genome-wide association analyses in 22,981 participants (2280 shingles cases) from the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Using Cox survival and logistic regression, we identified a genomic region in the combined and European ancestry groups that has an age of onset effect reaching genome-wide significance (P>1.0 × 10(-8)). This region tags the non-coding gene HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) in the major histocompatibility complex. This gene is an endogenous retrovirus and likely influences viral activity through regulatory functions. Variants in this genetic region are known to be associated with delay in development of AIDS in people infected by HIV. Our study provides further suggestion that this region may have a critical role in viral suppression and could potentially harbor a clinically actionable variant for the shingles vaccine.	 19720776 18974171 20335276 20041166 23531748 21846786 22761371 23743551 24270849 22037903 18382476 20178416 20064797 24171531 19200528 23060615 20819854 21269473 8385896 22511882 22659447 11984513 24167660 17701901 18490586 24384645
25305756	Discovery of new risk loci for IgA nephropathy implicates genes involved in immunity against intestinal pathogens.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis, with discovery and follow-up in 20,612 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. We identified six new genome-wide significant associations, four in ITGAM-ITGAX, VAV3 and CARD9 and two new independent signals at HLA-DQB1 and DEFA. We replicated the nine previously reported signals, including known SNPs in the HLA-DQB1 and DEFA loci. The cumulative burden of risk alleles is strongly associated with age at disease onset. Most loci are either directly associated with risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier and response to mucosal pathogens. The geospatial distribution of risk alleles is highly suggestive of multi-locus adaptation, and genetic risk correlates strongly with variation in local pathogens, particularly helminth diversity, suggesting a possible role for host-intestinal pathogen interactions in shaping the genetic landscape of IgAN. 	 19139088 18978771 20601685 19430480 20595679 21085593 21058334 21102463 21045073 21160052 21249183 21399633 21452313 21423246 21499248 21533074 21525388 21637784 21699788 21841780 21881212 21983784 22072984 22064851 22197929 22493691 22446964 22558069 11457894 11595063 11754464 11904577 12154359 12244179 22466613 22737082 22722251 23128233 23273568 23511034 23556020 23442222 23612313 23782179 23793132 23877587 23732773 24068945 24013639 24131138 24447578 24262508 19307593 19474294 19557189 19684571 19915574 20178769 20150532 20190752 20228799 19812545 20385819 20383147 20581238 20596022 20616382 20694011 11053425 12692084 12883005 14623913 3126449 3284962 9186068 10361137 16007086 16106078 15941910 16199517 16330776 16415888 16687733 16784338 16908915 17124531 17186473 17344885 17262812 17554300 17558408 17701901 17660530 17873877 17924348 18204098 18516037 19079255
25310577	Confirmation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia variants, ARID5B and IKZF1, and interaction with parental environmental exposures.	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have established association of ARID5B and IKZF1 variants with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors alone appear to make a relatively minor contribution to disease risk. The polygenic nature of childhood ALL predisposition together with the timing of environmental triggers may hold vital clues for disease etiology. This study presents results from an Australian GWAS of childhood ALL cases (n = 358) and population controls (n = 1192). Furthermore, we utilised family trio (n = 204) genotypes to extend our investigation to gene-environment interaction of significant loci with parental exposures before conception, and child's sex and age. Thirteen SNPs achieved genome wide significance in the population based case/control analysis; ten annotated to ARID5B and three to IKZF1. The most significant SNPs in these regions were ARID5B rs4245595 (OR 1.63, CI 1.38-1.93, P = 2.13×10(-9)), and IKZF1 rs1110701 (OR 1.69, CI 1.42-2.02, p = 7.26×10(-9)). There was evidence of gene-environment interaction for risk genotype at IKZF1, whereby an apparently stronger genetic effect was observed if the mother took folic acid or if the father did not smoke prior to pregnancy (respective interaction P-values: 0.04, 0.05). There were no interactions of risk genotypes with age or sex (P-values >0.2). Our results evidence that interaction of genetic variants and environmental exposures may further alter risk of childhood ALL however, investigation in a larger population is required. If interaction of folic acid supplementation and IKZF1 variants holds, it may be useful to quantify folate levels prior to initiating use of folic acid supplements.	 23247637 11483573 23675566 23996088 20453839 15022205 22143821 22660188 19684604 15214842 23692655 16365081 17366834 23836053 11117911 19839053 19684603 23512250 20460642 20634204 17701901 9423247 20056765 20042726 18846210 17957188 24013639
25310821	A genome-wide association study identifies potential susceptibility loci for Hirschsprung disease.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital and heterogeneous disorder characterized by the absence of intramural nervous plexuses along variable lengths of the hindgut. Although RET is a well-established risk factor, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HSCR has identified NRG1 as an additional susceptibility locus. To discover additional risk loci, we performed a GWAS of 123 sporadic HSCR patients and 432 unaffected controls using a large-scale platform with coverage of over 1 million polymorphic markers. The result was that our study replicated the findings of RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A genomic region (rawP = 5.69×10(-19) before a Bonferroni correction; corrP = 4.31×10(-13) after a Bonferroni correction) and NRG1 as susceptibility loci. In addition, this study identified SLC6A20 (adjP = 2.71×10(-6)), RORA (adjP = 1.26×10(-5)), and ABCC9 (adjP = 1.86×10(-5)) as new potential susceptibility loci under adjusting the already known loci on the RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A and NRG1 regions, although none of the SNPs in these genes passed the Bonferroni correction. In further subgroup analysis, the RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A genomic region was observed to have different significance levels among subgroups: short-segment (S-HSCR, corrP = 1.71×10(-5)), long-segment (L-HSCR, corrP = 6.66×10(-4)), and total colonic aganglionosis (TCA, corrP>0.05). This differential pattern in the significance level suggests that other genomic loci or mechanisms may affect the length of aganglionosis in HSCR subgroups during enteric nervous system (ENS) development. Although functional evaluations are needed, our findings might facilitate improved understanding of the mechanisms of HSCR pathogenesis.	 22266104 19033659 17514199 21575913 20800661 11592033 22325380 21283760 22974608 21892150 19196962 23671607 20089534 18970938 5567964 12355085 8630502 22722533 22008330 22395866 22897442 15632147 11454798 11774071 15829955 12631670 18477402 22589734 21834987 17965226
25457201	Genome-wide association study identifies TF as a significant modifier gene of iron metabolism in HFE hemochromatosis.	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common form of genetic iron loading disease. It is mainly related to the homozygous C282Y/C282Y mutation in the HFE gene that is, however, a necessary but not a sufficient condition to develop clinical and even biochemical HH. This suggests that modifier genes are likely involved in the expressivity of the disease. Our aim was to identify such modifier genes.	
25327703	Genome-wide association study of breast cancer in Latinas identifies novel protective variants on 6q25.	The genetic contributions to breast cancer development among Latinas are not well understood. Here we carry out a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in Latinas and identify a genome-wide significant risk variant, located 5' of the Estrogen Receptor 1 gene (ESR1; 6q25 region). The minor allele for this variant is strongly protective (rs140068132: odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.67, P=9 × 10(-18)), originates from Indigenous Americans and is uncorrelated with previously reported risk variants at 6q25. The association is stronger for oestrogen receptor-negative disease (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.54) than oestrogen receptor-positive disease (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.80; P heterogeneity=0.01) and is also associated with mammographic breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer (P=0.001). rs140068132 is located within several transcription factor-binding sites and electrophoretic mobility shift assays with MCF-7 nuclear protein demonstrate differential binding of the G/A alleles at this locus. These results highlight the importance of conducting research in diverse populations. 	 19405945 19543373 19451168 20084545 20332279 20453838 20585626 20661439 20644199 23535733 23544012 23544013 23714456 10835412 10695593 24509480 22976474 22951594 22923054 23460247 18326623 19047150 19182786 19219042 19330030 12824205 14575939 14575944 14652273 14617512 15217505 9492970 15712363 15894652 15799782 15958555 17035394 17463248 17529973 17529974 17529967 17701901 17903305 17934201 18159056 21908515 22037553 22383897 22266113 22228098 22454379 22879957 22452962 23000897 23001124 20852631 21151129 21278746 21062454 21263130 21478889 23535729
25335168	Common variants at 1p36 are associated with superior frontal gyrus volume.	The superior frontal gyrus (SFG), an area of the brain frequently found to have reduced gray matter in patients with schizophrenia, is involved in self-awareness and emotion, which are impaired in schizophrenia. However, no genome-wide association studies of SFG volume have investigated in patients with schizophrenia. To identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SFG volumes, we demonstrated a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of gray matter volumes in the right or left SFG of 158 patients with schizophrenia and 378 healthy subjects. We attempted to bioinformatically ascertain the potential effects of the top hit polymorphism on the expression levels of genes at the genome-wide region. We found associations between five variants on 1p36.12 and the right SFG volume at a widely used benchmark for genome-wide significance (P<5.0 × 10(-8)). The strongest association was observed at rs4654899, an intronic SNP in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 3 (EIF4G3) gene on 1p36.12 (P=7.5 × 10(-9)). No SNP with genome-wide significance was found in the volume of the left SFG (P>5.0 × 10(-8)); however, the rs4654899 polymorphism was identified as the locus with the second strongest association with the volume of the left SFG (P=1.5 × 10(-6)). In silico analyses revealed a proxy SNP of rs4654899 had effect on gene expression of two genes, HP1BP3 lying 3' to EIF4G3 (P=7.8 × 10(-6)) and CAPN14 at 2p (P=6.3 × 10(-6)), which are expressed in moderate-to-high levels throughout the adult human SFG. These results contribute to understand genetic architecture of a brain structure possibly linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.	 22504417 22253779 21936766 22150081 23732972 24160291 10885639 11525331 12874777 14609238 14662550 9490408 16630842 16862161 16988657 16860573 17021179 17761438 18285755 18424084 18361404 18677311 19526734 18980222 19571808 20957649 19633214 19759093 21593732 22504421
25729143	Genome-wide association study identifies three novel genetic markers associated with elite endurance performance.	To investigate the association between multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), aerobic performance and elite endurance athlete status in Russians. By using GWAS approach, we examined the association between 1,140,419 SNPs and relative maximal oxygen consumption rate ([Formula: see text]O2max) in 80 international-level Russian endurance athletes (46 males and 34 females). To validate obtained results, we further performed case-control studies by comparing the frequencies of the most significant SNPs (with P < 10(-5)-10(-8)) between 218 endurance athletes and opposite cohorts (192 Russian controls, 1367 European controls, and 230 Russian power athletes). Initially, six 'endurance alleles' were identified showing discrete associations with [Formula: see text]O2max both in males and females. Next, case-control studies resulted in remaining three SNPs (NFIA-AS2 rs1572312, TSHR rs7144481, RBFOX1 rs7191721) associated with endurance athlete status. The C allele of the most significant SNP, rs1572312, was associated with high values of [Formula: see text]O2max (males: P = 0.0051; females: P = 0.0005). Furthermore, the frequency of the rs1572312 C allele was significantly higher in elite endurance athletes (95.5%) in comparison with non-elite endurance athletes (89.8%, P = 0.0257), Russian (88.8%, P = 0.007) and European (90.6%, P = 0.0197) controls and power athletes (86.2%, P = 0.0005). The rs1572312 SNP is located on the nuclear factor I A antisense RNA 2 (NFIA-AS2) gene which is supposed to regulate the expression of the NFIA gene (encodes transcription factor involved in activation of erythropoiesis and repression of the granulopoiesis). Our data show that the NFIA-AS2 rs1572312, TSHR rs7144481 and RBFOX1 rs7191721 polymorphisms are associated with aerobic performance and elite endurance athlete status. 	 17926914 19542302 20133430 24744483 22730494 23628675 23286373 21867446 22567844 24253421 22419707 20299614 23190598 25435666 22749526 19521715 18924431 15705733 21290171 21115973 24262098 24744482 19268274 24055342 19688295 19455482 19123262 18279021 22122487 24172333 18825932 24887114 11707412 21183627
25338677	Genetic analysis of the pathogenic molecular sub-phenotype interferon-alpha identifies multiple novel loci involved in systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of multiple organ systems and dysregulated interferon responses. SLE is both genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, greatly reducing the power of case-control studies in SLE. Elevated circulating interferon-alpha (IFN-α) is a stable, heritable trait in SLE, which has been implicated in primary disease pathogenesis. About 40-50% of patients have high IFN-α, and high levels correspond with clinical differences. To study genetic heterogeneity in SLE, we performed a case-case study comparing patients with high vs low IFN-α in over 1550 SLE cases, including genome-wide association study and replication cohorts. In meta-analysis, the top associations in European ancestry were protein kinase, cyclic GMP-dependent, type I (PRKG1) rs7897633 (P(Meta) = 2.75 × 10(-8)) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) rs1049564 (P(Meta) = 1.24 × 10(-7)). We also found evidence for cross-ancestral background associations with the ankyrin repeat domain 44 (ANKRD44) and pleckstrin homology domain containing, family F member 2 gene (PLEKHF2) loci. These loci have not been previously identified in case-control SLE genetic studies. Bioinformatic analyses implicated these loci functionally in dendritic cells and natural killer cells, both of which are involved in IFN-α production in SLE. As case-control studies of heterogeneous diseases reach a limit of feasibility with respect to subject number and detectable effect size, the study of informative pathogenic sub-phenotypes becomes an attractive strategy for genetic discovery in complex disease.	 18050196 16135132 19109131 16642019 21162028 22505704 21270825 17581626 11438470 1931007 21792837 24101921 18683858 19762399 20652065 18668568 21430220 22019780 18525429 23253915 17804842 16736505 22801747 24416080 9192852 22523428 21543514 18186651 24608226 11590094 11711679 21502224 22045845 19995552 20659327 21705624 17660818 9122228 19854706 17021721 10386858 17701901 22988468 18204446 9737781 19193627 15565395 449915 11526379 19838195 16964310 18288467
25340798	Genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 alzheimer's disease candidate proteins: significant associations with proteins involved in amyloid processing and inflammation.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 42 amino acid species of amyloid beta (Aβ42) and tau levels are strongly correlated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology including amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration and have been successfully used as endophenotypes for genetic studies of AD. Additional CSF analytes may also serve as useful endophenotypes that capture other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Here we have conducted a genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 AD-related analytes. All analytes were measured using the Rules Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel, which includes analytes relevant to several disease-related processes. Data from two independently collected and measured datasets, the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were analyzed separately, and combined results were obtained using meta-analysis. We identified genetic associations with CSF levels of 5 proteins (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)) with study-wide significant p-values (p<1.46×10-10) and significant, consistent evidence for association in both the Knight ADRC and the ADNI samples. These proteins are involved in amyloid processing and pro-inflammatory signaling. SNPs associated with ACE, IL6R and MMP3 protein levels are located within the coding regions of the corresponding structural gene. The SNPs associated with CSF levels of CCL4 and CCL2 are located in known chemokine binding proteins. The genetic associations reported here are novel and suggest mechanisms for genetic control of CSF and plasma levels of these disease-related proteins. Significant SNPs in ACE and MMP3 also showed association with AD risk. Our findings suggest that these proteins/pathways may be valuable therapeutic targets for AD. Robust associations in cognitively normal individuals suggest that these SNPs also influence regulation of these proteins more generally and may therefore be relevant to other diseases. 	 9796998 20634593 19539712 20197062 16787929 9665462 15337261 20932310 17210801 8987819 16862161 17030780 16773571 19433664 17687040 17065436 15370700 18464913 17384015 24040196 20005921 18431000 23593036 23922698 22567092 22319020 15733091 14986105 23573206 16648635 20482449 17366635 7783982 9645958 18850115 21347408 18813964 17316907 18541914 17898129 20862329 8627321 12379519 17077200 24729949 16006970 16372280 22303443 24399358 19822868 20354512 21300955 23562540 10858586 12220549 16600985 24092460 20031604 16307829 21139807 20026129 21471435 21123754 22821396 16642441 21907864 23727081 9507194 24162737 23608917 17938634 8562936 1909530 22955989 15142265 17701901 23785173 9364936 19593388 17903307 24548642 17329566 23894628 24523541 12044988 20681057 20451871 12824425 23948942 21297258 23314186 22089642 20066004 17525752 11604391 10672313 23969696 23787478 20601685 20625269 21508244 16154999 12612547
25342443	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci associated with both mammographic density and breast cancer risk.	Mammographic density reflects the amount of stromal and epithelial tissues in relation to adipose tissue in the breast and is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Here we report the results from meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of three mammographic density phenotypes: dense area, non-dense area and percent density in up to 7,916 women in stage 1 and an additional 10,379 women in stage 2. We identify genome-wide significant (P<5 × 10(-8)) loci for dense area (AREG, ESR1, ZNF365, LSP1/TNNT3, IGF1, TMEM184B and SGSM3/MKL1), non-dense area (8p11.23) and percent density (PRDM6, 8p11.23 and TMEM184B). Four of these regions are known breast cancer susceptibility loci, and four additional regions were found to be associated with breast cancer (P<0.05) in a large meta-analysis. These results provide further evidence of a shared genetic basis between mammographic density and breast cancer and illustrate the power of studying intermediate quantitative phenotypes to identify putative disease-susceptibility loci. 	 10997541 12239257 8116623 8972250 9545414 16341085 16614099 17529967 20616382 20702402 21304890 21278746 21478494 21908515 22064851 22267197 22383897 22266113 22017857 22532574 22454379 22955989 22955616 23000897 22747683 23128226 22976474 23535729 23535733 24325915 24721635 24816206 24915186 24915306 20661439 18190724 19131956 19033363 19219042 20233392 20460303 20453838 20472501
25343990	Genome-wide association study of selenium concentrations.	Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in human nutrition, but its role in certain health conditions, particularly among Se sufficient populations, is controversial. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of blood Se concentrations previously identified a locus at 5q14 near BHMT. We performed a GW meta-analysis of toenail Se concentrations, which reflect a longer duration of exposure than blood Se concentrations, including 4162 European descendants from four US cohorts. Toenail Se was measured using neutron activation analysis. We identified a GW-significant locus at 5q14 (P < 1 × 10(-16)), the same locus identified in the published GWAS of blood Se based on independent cohorts. The lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) explained ∼1% of the variance in toenail Se concentrations. Using GW-summary statistics from both toenail and blood Se, we observed statistical evidence of polygenic overlap (P < 0.001) and meta-analysis of results from studies of either trait (n = 9639) yielded a second GW-significant locus at 21q22.3, harboring CBS (P < 4 × 10(-8)). Proteins encoded by genes at 5q14 and 21q22.3 function in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism, and index SNPs for each have previously been associated with betaine and Hcy levels in GWAS. Our findings show evidence of a genetic link between Se and Hcy pathways, both involved in cardiometabolic disease. 	 21093336 23603996 16862161 17786212 6456763 6157075 20714348 15961316 20718045 21316044 8849037 21094028 24524080 20350341 12566477 15864280 17449570 17988700 18683819 22833659 22619078 23698163 23440843 12446535 23014492 17529973 15536605 19200528 21829377 22447075 19299660 11319631 18230605 3204420 20598278 21898179 21886157 23720494 20233392 17216685 24139672 12042420 9390171 16977515 12840211 21880673 11568447 17701901 23824729 8793364 18348202 15226462 17436311 20031578 19420095 24263672 23378610 20812787 23552052 22381456 24013639 11011839
25344690	Common variants associated with general and MMR vaccine-related febrile seizures.	Febrile seizures represent a serious adverse event following measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. We conducted a series of genome-wide association scans comparing children with MMR-related febrile seizures, children with febrile seizures unrelated to vaccination and controls with no history of febrile seizures. Two loci were distinctly associated with MMR-related febrile seizures, harboring the interferon-stimulated gene IFI44L (rs273259: P = 5.9 × 10(-12) versus controls, P = 1.2 × 10(-9) versus MMR-unrelated febrile seizures) and the measles virus receptor CD46 (rs1318653: P = 9.6 × 10(-11) versus controls, P = 1.6 × 10(-9) versus MMR-unrelated febrile seizures). Furthermore, four loci were associated with febrile seizures in general, implicating the sodium channel genes SCN1A (rs6432860: P = 2.2 × 10(-16)) and SCN2A (rs3769955: P = 3.1 × 10(-10)), a TMEM16 family gene (ANO3; rs114444506: P = 3.7 × 10(-20)) and a region associated with magnesium levels (12q21.33; rs11105468: P = 3.4 × 10(-11)). Finally, we show the functional relevance of ANO3 (TMEM16C) with electrophysiological experiments in wild-type and knockout rats. 	 23522981 23872594 24037378 24014518 24013639 19743470 11113018 11287589 11315092 11547719 11775787 12111919 12243921 12350392 12499305 12540904 12590259 15265850 64807 6538005 4022374 3801897 8371352 8402913 9675544 14399531 16360562 16492729 16939854 17150149 17181438 17289734 17436242 17537961 17560639 18275925 18462017 19211496 19543373 19575812 20100831 20354512 20371507 20676075 20700443 20616382 20981092 21267061 20517342 21478870 21277190 21642943 21775347 21876820 22086389 22056342 22138821 22265947 22357652 22547512 22406257 22525008 22908290 23086396 23086397 23200863
25350695	Pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of LDL cholesterol response to statins.	Statins effectively lower LDL cholesterol levels in large studies and the observed interindividual response variability may be partially explained by genetic variation. Here we perform a pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in studies addressing the LDL cholesterol response to statins, including up to 18,596 statin-treated subjects. We validate the most promising signals in a further 22,318 statin recipients and identify two loci, SORT1/CELSR2/PSRC1 and SLCO1B1, not previously identified in GWAS. Moreover, we confirm the previously described associations with APOE and LPA.

25352340	Novel loci affecting iron homeostasis and their effects in individuals at risk for hemochromatosis.	Variation in body iron is associated with or causes diseases, including anaemia and iron overload. Here, we analyse genetic association data on biochemical markers of iron status from 11 European-population studies, with replication in eight additional cohorts (total up to 48,972 subjects). We find 11 genome-wide-significant (P<5 × 10(-8)) loci, some including known iron-related genes (HFE, SLC40A1, TF, TFR2, TFRC, TMPRSS6) and others novel (ABO, ARNTL, FADS2, NAT2, TEX14). SNPs at ARNTL, TF, and TFR2 affect iron markers in HFE C282Y homozygotes at risk for hemochromatosis. There is substantial overlap between our iron loci and loci affecting erythrocyte and lipid phenotypes. These results will facilitate investigation of the roles of iron in disease. 	 20878249 21408141 21346098 21378990 21349849 21829377 21886157 20864672 21075283 20826723 21248018 21147772 21300955 21208937 21228252 22001757 22154776 22095982 22500797 23002334 23222517 23150675 23232066 23473030 23381919 23750121 23613366 23801727 24013639 24097068 24121126 24199959 24391488 24385536 10739755 11812557 12851225 2331526 15685557 15858186 16627556 16880463 16893896 17275618 17039515 17413089 17729396 18199861 18462017 18988764 18976480 19254567 19847309 19820697 19820698 19820699 19862010 19824072 19918260 20081858 20147318 20185807 20598278 20603012 20631077 19060906 20565855 20686565 20616382 20800590
25353672	Genome wide association study identifies a novel putative mammographic density locus at 1q12-q21.	Mammographic density (MD) is an intermediate phenotype for breast cancer. Previous studies have identified genetic variants associated with MD; however, much of the genetic contribution to MD is unexplained. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association analysis among the participants in the "Determinants of Density in Mammographies in Spain" study, together with a replication analysis in women from the Australian MD Twins and Sisters Study. Our discovery set covered a total of 3,351 Caucasian women aged 45 to 68 years, recruited from Spanish breast cancer screening centres. MD was blindly assessed by a single reader using Boyd's scale. A two-stage approach was employed, including a feature selection phase exploring 575,374 SNPs in 239 pairs of women with extreme phenotypes and a verification stage for the 183 selected SNPs in the remaining sample (2,873 women). Replication was conducted in 1,786 women aged 40 to 70 years old recruited via the Australian Twin Registry, where MD were measured using Cumulus-3.0, assessing 14 SNPs with a p value <0.10 in stage 2. Finally, two genetic variants in high linkage disequilibrium with our best hit were studied using the whole Spanish sample. Evidence of association with MD was found for variant rs11205277 (OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.67-0.81; p = 1.33 × 10(-10) ). In replication analysis, only a marginal association between this SNP and absolute dense area was found. There were also evidence of association between MD and SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs11205277, rs11205303 in gene MTMR11 (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.66-0.80; p = 2.64 × 10(-11) ) and rs67807996 in gene OTUD7B (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.66-0.80; p = 2.03 × 10(-11)). Our findings provide additional evidence on common genetic variations that may contribute to MD.	
25456346	Genomic predictors of combat stress vulnerability and resilience in U.S. Marines: A genome-wide association study across multiple ancestries implicates PRTFDC1 as a potential PTSD gene.	Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort.	
25158072	Cross-disorder genome-wide analyses suggest a complex genetic relationship between Tourette's syndrome and OCD.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome are highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to share genetic risk factors. However, the identification of definitive susceptibility genes for these etiologically complex disorders remains elusive. The authors report a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Tourette's syndrome and OCD.	 17241830 16999878 18300295 18348202 18412099 18359008 19543373 19571811 1461793 9160576 10050965 10467490 11530429 19913658 20215007 20351724 20427746 20427753 20445167 20616382 20981092 21156269 21926972 21926974 22889924 22889921 24204291 3465280 10732667 15892140 16383224 16580870 16585942 16862161 17701901
25364816	A genome-wide association study for diabetic retinopathy in a Japanese population: potential association with a long intergenic non-coding RNA.	Elucidation of the genetic susceptibility factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of DR, and may help to define genetic risk factors for this condition. In the present study, we conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify DR susceptibility loci in Japanese patients, which comprised a total of 837 type 2 diabetes patients with DR (cases) and 1,149 without DR (controls). From the stage 1 genome-wide scan of 446 subjects (205 cases and 241 controls) on 614,216 SNPs, 249 SNPs were selected for the stage 2 replication in 623 subjects (335 cases and 288 controls). Eight SNPs were further followed up in a stage 3 study of 297 cases and 620 controls. The top signal from the present association analysis was rs9362054 in an intron of RP1-90L14.1 showing borderline genome-wide significance (Pmet = 1.4×10(-7), meta-analysis of stage 1 and stage 2, allele model). RP1-90L14.1 is a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) adjacent to KIAA1009/QN1/CEP162 gene; CEP162 plays a critical role in ciliary transition zone formation before ciliogenesis. The present study raises the possibility that the dysregulation of ciliary-associated genes plays a role in susceptibility to DR.	 22829176 23644468 16862161 21441570 24201651 11978667 23856252 9588456 17359929 12421427 22253303 20306445 17658465 15855583 22094949 16415888 19587357 16302001 19806208 22950970 24403848 17251272 17395753 15297300 11287185 15963467 22843501 24296535 20699456 17878250 9356033 20871662 24162842 23042674 21310492 21210154 14702427 17701901 23353010 21796137 16043738 15333482 23485060 21438851 24281142 23771613 23562823 6759208 21506742
25367360	Genome-wide association study for refractive astigmatism reveals genetic co-determination with spherical equivalent refractive error: the CREAM consortium.	To identify genetic variants associated with refractive astigmatism in the general population, meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies were performed for: White Europeans aged at least 25 years (20 cohorts, N = 31,968); Asian subjects aged at least 25 years (7 cohorts, N = 9,295); White Europeans aged <25 years (4 cohorts, N = 5,640); and all independent individuals from the above three samples combined with a sample of Chinese subjects aged <25 years (N = 45,931). Participants were classified as cases with refractive astigmatism if the average cylinder power in their two eyes was at least 1.00 diopter and as controls otherwise. Genome-wide association analysis was carried out for each cohort separately using logistic regression. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. In the older European group the most strongly associated marker was downstream of the neurexin-1 (NRXN1) gene (rs1401327, P = 3.92E-8). No other region reached genome-wide significance, and association signals were lower for the younger European group and Asian group. In the meta-analysis of all cohorts, no marker reached genome-wide significance: The most strongly associated regions were, NRXN1 (rs1401327, P = 2.93E-07), TOX (rs7823467, P = 3.47E-07) and LINC00340 (rs12212674, P = 1.49E-06). For 34 markers identified in prior GWAS for spherical equivalent refractive error, the beta coefficients for genotype versus spherical equivalent, and genotype versus refractive astigmatism, were highly correlated (r = -0.59, P = 2.10E-04). This work revealed no consistent or strong genetic signals for refractive astigmatism; however, the TOX gene region previously identified in GWAS for spherical equivalent refractive error was the second most strongly associated region. Analysis of additional markers provided evidence supporting widespread genetic co-susceptibility for spherical and astigmatic refractive errors. 	 24144296 22507743 18263651 14628964 23468642 20835239 15829845 5289474 12753478 21984434 21532571 21850187 22507742 22969067 8927316 21665993 14747763 9097791 17177660 19182780 17365815 11594943 14747757 18326703 22085899 22280520 21149283 23644224 18300295 16032514 20019881 19675094 19424496 21307088 20881960 14499819 21095009 15845033 22820512 20630598 7223852 17989066 23438823 17254428 19420339 21877163 20616382 8366922 19797211 19880184 20580707 23269928 23950154 23396134 23533028 21098505 19803772 2805714 5281065 23401653 19767753 11328732 21058334 23657481 16877283 20835236 17197519 15054401 12583787 869007 23322567 19804789 21436268 21856010 12414997 21185080 22265214 19875653 22144915 10588299 23474815 15134473 20386351 19875614 18385047 21991387 12631016 24142238 1184316 23248542 7933369 23222812
25376901	Genetic markers associated with plasma protein C level in African Americans: the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study.	Protein C is an endogenous anticoagulant protein with anti-inflammatory properties. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect the levels of circulating protein C in European Americans. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) scan of plasma protein C concentration with approximately 2.5 million SNPs in 2,701 African Americans in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Seventy-nine SNPs from the 20q11 and 2q14 regions reached the genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10(-8) . A missense variant rs867186 in the PROCR gene at 20q11 is known to affect protein C levels in individuals of European descent and showed the strongest signal (P = 9.84 × 10(-65) ) in African Americans. The minor allele of this SNP was associated with higher protein C levels (β = 0.49 μg/ml; 10% variance explained). In the 2q14 region, the top SNPs were near or within the PROC gene: rs7580658 (β = 0.15 μg/ml; 2% variance explained, P = 1.7 × 10(-12) ) and rs1799808 (β = 0.15 μg/ml; 2% variance explained, P = 2.03 × 10(-12) ). These two SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another SNP rs1158867 that resides in a biochemically functional site and in weak to strong LD with the top PROC variants previously reported in individuals of European descent. In addition, two variants outside the PROC region were significantly and independently associated with protein C levels: rs4321325 in CYP27C1 and rs13419716 in MYO7B. In summary, this first GWA study for plasma protein C levels in African Americans confirms the associations of SNPs in the PROC and PROCR regions with circulating levels of protein C across ethnic populations and identifies new candidates for protein C regulation.	 10364092 7749828 16409473 16862161 17284699 18249579 18680534 19132190 19215730 19474294 20802025 12067914 14576048 21347282 22216198 22443383 6895379 6688122 1458214 1342324 7742536 15921688

25378659	Genetic loci associated with circulating levels of very long-chain saturated fatty acids.	Very long-chain saturated fatty acids (VLSFAs) are saturated fatty acids with 20 or more carbons. In contrast to the more abundant saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, there is growing evidence that circulating VLSFAs may have beneficial biological properties. Whether genetic factors influence circulating levels of VLSFAs is not known. We investigated the association of common genetic variation with plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of three VLSFAs by performing genome-wide association studies in seven population-based cohorts comprising 10,129 subjects of European ancestry. We observed associations of circulating VLSFA concentrations with common variants in two genes, serine palmitoyl-transferase long-chain base subunit 3 (SPTLC3), a gene involved in the rate-limiting step of de novo sphingolipid synthesis, and ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4). The SPTLC3 variant at rs680379 was associated with higher arachidic acid (20:0 , P = 5.81 × 10(-13)). The CERS4 variant at rs2100944 was associated with higher levels of 20:0 (P = 2.65 × 10(-40)) and in analyses that adjusted for 20:0, with lower levels of behenic acid (P = 4.22 × 10(-26)) and lignoceric acid (P = 3.20 × 10(-21)). These novel associations suggest an inter-relationship of circulating VLSFAs and sphingolipid synthesis. 	 11082213 12672919 12782147 3812343 8621798 9894883 10521860 16415888 16469979 16564093 17572673 17676998 18442630 18515784 18832646 19200528 19372418 19798445 20018209 20110363 19852959 20671299 21058334 21543327 21829377 21910080 21811075 22070478 22133871 22248339 22493506 22579584 22864056 22984005 23362303 24970268 25107579 25107467
25378290	The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) sibling pairs genome-wide data.	Here we provide a detailed description of the genome-wide information available on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) sibling pair subsample (Harris et al. in Twin Res Hum Genet 16:391-398, 2013). A total of 2,020 samples were genotyped (including duplicates) arising from 1946 Add Health individuals from the sibling pairs subsample. After various steps for quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA), we have high quality genome-wide data available on 1,888 individuals. In this report, we first highlight the QC and QA steps that were taken to prune the data of poorly performing samples and genetic markers. We further estimate the pairwise biological relationships using genome-wide data and compare those estimates to the assumed relationships in Add Health. Additionally, using genome-wide data from known regional reference populations from Europe, West Africa, North and South America, Japan and China, we estimate the relative genetic ancestry of the respondents. Finally, rather than conducting a traditional cross-sectional genome-wide association study (GWAS) of body mass index (BMI), we opted to utilize the extensive publicly available genome-wide information to conduct a weighted GWAS of longitudinal BMI while accounting for both family and ethnic variation. 	 18974171 20562875 17636204 22629316 22658725 20838612 22516502 17434869 21753830 24068893 22748210 19883141 24406073 23785302 23927547 20935630 23045663 19150910 20811451 21682921 16400608 23927514 23874208 17549760 20711421 23512250 23231780 22511882 20018085 17701901 22365150 24281739 24094743 21167468 11055368 19648217 22021425 20926424 18292342 23969696 23740691 21664708

25383971	Variation at HLA-DRB1 is associated with resistance to enteric fever.	Enteric fever affects more than 25 million people annually and results from systemic infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Paratyphi pathovars A, B or C(1). We conducted a genome-wide association study of 432 individuals with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever and 2,011 controls from Vietnam. We observed strong association at rs7765379 (odds ratio (OR) for the minor allele = 0.18, P = 4.5 × 10(-10)), a marker mapping to the HLA class II region, in proximity to HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1. We replicated this association in 595 enteric fever cases and 386 controls from Nepal and also in a second independent collection of 151 cases and 668 controls from Vietnam. Imputation-based fine-mapping across the extended MHC region showed that the classical HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele (OR = 0.14, P = 2.60 × 10(-11)) could entirely explain the association at rs7765379, thus implicating HLA-DRB1 as a major contributor to resistance against enteric fever, presumably through antigen presentation. 	 10858343 23266558 21131975 11713529 8791590 25070946 10093945 23198130 22286218 22001756 11280056 12121274 17206141 15728500 12499305 23762245 23982073 21687432 17387130 24698974 22445588 12134261 19853241 20802473 11237848 23291585 21051598 8898752 23263489 24776769 15298225 24386394 21349094 24282626 21531174 9603733 17593957 15014297 21452313 20694013 10223217 16998491 18026123 23985342 17701901 20014951 5316853 17503085 17641165 20015961 20981092 22306650 23591641 24997987 20694014 11120931
25383866	Results of a "GWAS plus:" general cognitive ability is substantially heritable and massively polygenic.	We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for general cognitive ability (GCA) plus three other analyses of GWAS data that aggregate the effects of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various ways. Our multigenerational sample comprised 7,100 Caucasian participants, drawn from two longitudinal family studies, who had been assessed with an age-appropriate IQ test and had provided DNA samples passing quality screens. We conducted the GWAS across ∼ 2.5 million SNPs (both typed and imputed), using a generalized least-squares method appropriate for the different family structures present in our sample, and subsequently conducted gene-based association tests. We also conducted polygenic prediction analyses under five-fold cross-validation, using two different schemes of weighting SNPs. Using parametric bootstrapping, we assessed the performance of this prediction procedure under the null. Finally, we estimated the proportion of variance attributable to all genotyped SNPs as random effects with software GCTA. The study is limited chiefly by its power to detect realistic single-SNP or single-gene effects, none of which reached genome-wide significance, though some genomic inflation was evident from the GWAS. Unit SNP weights performed about as well as least-squares regression weights under cross-validation, but the performance of both increased as more SNPs were included in calculating the polygenic score. Estimates from GCTA were 35% of phenotypic variance at the recommended biological-relatedness ceiling. Taken together, our results concur with other recent studies: they support a substantial heritability of GCA, arising from a very large number of causal SNPs, each of very small effect. We place our study in the context of the literature-both contemporary and historical-and provide accessible explication of our statistical methods.	 10624730 23358156 11315092 11600885 11882781 12141781 12486697 12537881 14997420 15052271 7195071 8801636 9545387 16041375 16077740 16417617 16721405 16862161 16983374 17279339 17701901 17943122 18443579 18067574 19200528 19571811 19803776 20562875 20581876 20598278 20881960 21058334 20306291 21142928 21167468 21036197 20528860 21474944 21407268 21826061 21943169 22566634 23012269 23363460
25385369	FASTKD2 is associated with memory and hippocampal structure in older adults.	Memory impairment is the cardinal early feature of Alzheimer's disease, a highly prevalent disorder whose causes remain only partially understood. To identify novel genetic predictors, we used an integrative genomics approach to perform the largest study to date of human memory (n=14 781). Using a genome-wide screen, we discovered a novel association of a polymorphism in the pro-apoptotic gene FASTKD2 (fas-activated serine/threonine kinase domains 2; rs7594645-G) with better memory performance and replicated this finding in independent samples. Consistent with a neuroprotective effect, rs7594645-G carriers exhibited increased hippocampal volume and gray matter density and decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of apoptotic mediators. The MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) gene and pathways related to endocytosis, cholinergic neurotransmission, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and immune regulation, among others, also displayed association with memory. These findings nominate FASTKD2 as a target for modulating neurodegeneration and suggest potential mechanisms for therapies to combat memory loss in normal cognitive aging and dementia. 	 23541342 22854024 18974171 22711244 17486121 19741703 22941192 17470457 19605830 24093081 19689234 21304480 22031440 17646846 23265840 12742739 22251954 24145423 23932184 21371747 20501604 23419831 15685217 23550670 16786033 23300413 22820512 17053149 22955616 12958120 20616382 22865056 22471867 23060615 21835680 22714018 23562540 20581814 15297300 21391232 21048198 24092460 19369661 17982457 20080789 23019586 23608917 21263443 15644446 20634204 22105620 19498435 17701901 21444724 23224545 22471860 18348202 19361613 19840553 18771761 19167326 23894628 8346443 20451871 20376313 20702402 22480918 21840749 23296339 22958900 19906259 23195314 23732877
25390645	Genome-wide and gene-based association studies of anxiety disorders in European and African American samples.	Anxiety disorders (ADs) are common mental disorders caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Since ADs are highly comorbid with each other, partially due to shared genetic basis, studying AD phenotypes in a coordinated manner may be a powerful strategy for identifying potential genetic loci for ADs. To detect these loci, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADs. In addition, as a complementary approach to single-locus analysis, we also conducted gene- and pathway-based analyses. GWAS data were derived from the control sample of the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) project (2,540 European American and 849 African American subjects) genotyped on the Affymetrix GeneChip 6.0 array. We applied two phenotypic approaches: (1) categorical case-control comparisons (CC) based upon psychiatric diagnoses, and (2) quantitative phenotypic factor scores (FS) derived from a multivariate analysis combining information across the clinical phenotypes. Linear and logistic models were used to analyse the association with ADs using FS and CC traits, respectively. At the single locus level, no genome-wide significant association was found. A trans-population gene-based meta-analysis across both ethnic subsamples using FS identified three genes (MFAP3L on 4q32.3, NDUFAB1 and PALB2 on 16p12) with genome-wide significance (false discovery rate (FDR] <5%). At the pathway level, several terms such as transcription regulation, cytokine binding, and developmental process were significantly enriched in ADs (FDR <5%). Our approaches studying ADs as quantitative traits and utilizing the full GWAS data may be useful in identifying susceptibility genes and pathways for ADs. 	 21847142 19859063 19918758 20516154 20598278 20616382 20872766 20125088 20368705 21871609 24278274 21927923 6544237 22126751 22471665 22473089 23064677 23149450 23468190 22889921 22869035 23726511 11578982 11847309 12648681 15272419 7944874 15543147 15297300 15939837 16532386 16648327 16793542 17121688 17286594 17554300 17701901 18570457 18762592 19131956 18928402 19885930 24080187
25407941	GWAS identifies four novel eosinophilic esophagitis loci.	Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic disorder characterized by infiltration of the oesophagus with eosinophils. We had previously reported association of the TSLP/WDR36 locus with EoE. Here we report genome-wide significant associations at four additional loci; c11orf30 and STAT6, which have been previously associated with both atopic and autoimmune diseases, and two EoE-specific loci, ANKRD27 that regulates the trafficking of melanogenic enzymes to epidermal melanocytes and CAPN14, that encodes a calpain whose expression is highly enriched in the oesophagus. The identification of five EoE loci, not only expands our aetiological understanding of the disease but may also represent new therapeutic targets to treat the most debilitating aspect of EoE, oesophageal inflammation and remodelling. 	 11675017 25017104 14749260 14993220 15131563 15329438 2555341 7720071 16551261 17489048 17919504 18073124 18587394 19172120 19349984 19403694 19837067 20208534 20686710 21139605 21297633 21670566 21617960 21804548 21804549 21907864 22036096 22075330 22315412 22673904 22955811 23042114 23104059 23715323 23817569 23817571 23827349 24718597 14651845

25917933	A genome-wide association study of suicide severity scores in bipolar disorder.	Suicide claims one million lives worldwide annually, making it a serious public health concern. The risk for suicidal behaviour can be partly explained by genetic factors, as suggested by twin and family studies (reviewed in (Zai et al. 2012)). Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of suicide attempt on large samples of bipolar disorder (BD) patients from multiple sites have identified a number of novel candidate genes. GWASs of suicide behaviour severity, from suicidal ideation to serious suicide attempt, have not been reported for BD.	
25420145	Common variation in PHACTR1 is associated with susceptibility to cervical artery dissection.	Cervical artery dissection (CeAD), a mural hematoma in a carotid or vertebral artery, is a major cause of ischemic stroke in young adults although relatively uncommon in the general population (incidence of 2.6/100,000 per year). Minor cervical traumas, infection, migraine and hypertension are putative risk factors, and inverse associations with obesity and hypercholesterolemia are described. No confirmed genetic susceptibility factors have been identified using candidate gene approaches. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 1,393 CeAD cases and 14,416 controls. The rs9349379[G] allele (PHACTR1) was associated with lower CeAD risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-0.82; P = 4.46 × 10(-10)), with confirmation in independent follow-up samples (659 CeAD cases and 2,648 controls; P = 3.91 × 10(-3); combined P = 1.00 × 10(-11)). The rs9349379[G] allele was previously shown to be associated with lower risk of migraine and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying this pleiotropy might provide important information on the biological underpinnings of these disabling conditions. 	 22751097 11872884 16862161 21846871 21378990 15731757 22286173 24057673 22683712 24013639 21245119 19948418 21900632 19659826 23479725 21939755 19073967 19198609 20364137 19151021 23202125 22144573 21444882 22306652 16636253 19114994 22745674 21297030 17522995 20212493 18997786 23041239 22491867 20634204 21666692 15933263 19390073 21798305 23793025 17962595 21378988 15243148 22055160 18642345 19539238 21909107 18603160 10706896 17130413 23042660 15107502

25429064	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of adult height in East Asians identifies 17 novel loci.	Human height is associated with risk of multiple diseases and is profoundly determined by an individual's genetic makeup and shows a high degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) analyses of adult height in Europeans have identified nearly 180 genetic loci. A recent study showed high replicability of results from Europeans-based GWA studies in Asians; however, population-specific loci may exist due to distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. We carried out a GWA meta-analysis in 93 926 individuals from East Asia. We identified 98 loci, including 17 novel and 81 previously reported loci, associated with height at P < 5 × 10(-8), together explaining 8.89% of phenotypic variance. Among the newly identified variants, 10 are commonly distributed (minor allele frequency, MAF > 5%) in Europeans, with comparable frequencies with in Asians, and 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms are with low frequency (MAF < 5%) in Europeans. In addition, our data suggest that novel biological pathway such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase family is involved in regulation of height. The findings from this study considerably expand our knowledge of the genetic architecture of human height in Asians. 	 19030899 19148276 19557189 20714348 19627167 19715440 19893584 20096396 19857615 20189936 20562874 20881960 20864672 21040914 21494559 21782509 22001757 22359512 22426310 22977225 22753236 23428607 23785302 23871699 25282103 17966091 11315092 11704759 12111919 12717436 14685227 4386970 7614237 10449345 16670158 17572673 17559308 17695343 17906644 18391950 18391952 19200528

25434496	Genetic variants at 1q32.1, 10q11.2 and 19q13.41 are associated with prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer screening in two Korean population-based cohort studies.	Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are affected by non-cancerous conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, inflammations, and inherited factors. To search for genetic variants associated with PSA levels, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a two-stage design. A total of 554 men from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II were used as a discovery stage and 1575 men collected by the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study were used as a replication stage. Analysis by Genome-wide Human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 5.0 was performed by using DNAs derived from venous blood. We analyzed the association between genetic variants and PSA levels using multivariate linear regression models, including age as a covariate. We detected 12 genome-wide significant signals on chromosome 1q32.1, 10q11.2, and 19q13.41 between PSA levels and SNPs. The top SNP associated with log PSA levels was rs2153904 in SLC45A3 (p values, 5.24×10(-9) to 2.00×10(-6)). We also investigated GWAS using 754 subjects from KCPS-II cohort whether our genome-wide significant loci were associated with a risk of prostate cancer (PCa) (200 PCa cases and 554 controls). Three of the SNPs on 10q11.2, rs7077830, rs2611489, and rs4631830, were associated with a risk of PCa. However, two loci, 1q32.1 and 19q13, were not significantly associated with a PCa risk. We suggest that our results for some but not all PCa risk SNPs to be associated with PSA levels could be used as an evidence for the advance of individual PCa screening strategies, such as applying a personalized cutoff value for PSA.	
25387707	Heritability and molecular genetic basis of antisaccade eye tracking error rate: a genome-wide association study.	Antisaccade deficits reflect abnormalities in executive function linked to various disorders including schizophrenia, externalizing psychopathology, and neurological conditions. We examined the genetic bases of antisaccade error in a sample of community-based twins and parents (N = 4,469). Biometric models showed that about half of the variance in the antisaccade response was due to genetic factors and half due to nonshared environmental factors. Molecular genetic analyses supported these results, showing that the heritability accounted for by common molecular genetic variants approximated biometric estimates. Genome-wide analyses revealed several SNPs as well as two genes-B3GNT7 and NCL-on Chromosome 2 associated with antisaccade error. SNPs and genes hypothesized to be associated with antisaccade error based on prior work, although generating some suggestive findings for MIR137, GRM8, and CACNG2, could not be confirmed. 	 23756893 23014265 11206670 12236334 18562342 12467945 12919716 25387704 16862161 23128226 19575259 25387709 12537881 22773897 16805870 15950020 19803776 16203110 12668349 20800221 22820512 22270353 25387708 25387703 25387705 14976521 23453885 18618593 18458787 15211621 17984393 25387710 24581832 20598278 18571626 19149910 22253750 16650833 19268276 11136640 25387706 21474944 22247735 11738534 23363460 24080895 23511790 9844427 20595427 15374584 15336515 21167468 22573640 23986300 12672781 23217325 19900610 23278927 22802938 21498463 22777127 21910931
25387708	Heritability and molecular genetic basis of acoustic startle eye blink and affectively modulated startle response: a genome-wide association study.	Acoustic startle responses have been studied extensively in relation to individual differences and psychopathology. We examined three indices of the blink response in a picture-viewing paradigm-overall startle magnitude across all picture types, and aversive and pleasant modulation scores-in 3,323 twins and parents. Biometric models and molecular genetic analyses showed that half the variance in overall startle was due to additive genetic effects. No single nucleotide polymorphism was genome-wide significant, but GRIK3 produced a significant effect when examined as part of a candidate gene set. In contrast, emotion modulation scores showed little evidence of heritability in either biometric or molecular genetic analyses. However, in a genome-wide scan, PARP14 produced a significant effect for aversive modulation. We conclude that, although overall startle retains potential as an endophenotype, emotion-modulated startle does not. 	 23756893 18985386 19022628 9821563 9238214 15860334 16862161 20052609 14642434 8436703 17241146 19818050 15546642 20483176 12668349 11986986 15273990 25387703 17723027 12946114 16364071 8547457 12948786 16252231 17984393 9861467 20598278 21474944 12934687 22247735 19883142 23363460 3204235 2200076 21312406 8856694 16958029 19693004 19096959 21167468 18729643 9360775 23217325 24117611 20374544 21498463 17033630 19995671
25387704	Heritability and molecular-genetic basis of resting EEG activity: a genome-wide association study.	Several EEG parameters are potential endophenotypes for different psychiatric disorders. The present study consists of a comprehensive behavioral- and molecular-genetic analysis of such parameters in a large community sample (N = 4,026) of adolescent twins and their parents, genotyped for 527,829 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Biometric heritability estimates ranged from .49 to .85, with a median of .78. The additive effect of all SNPs (SNP heritability) varied across electrodes. Although individual SNPs were not significantly associated with EEG parameters, several genes were associated with delta power. We also obtained an association between the GABRA2 gene and beta power (p < .014), consistent with findings reported by others, although this did not survive Bonferroni correction. If EEG parameters conform to a largely polygenic model of inheritance, larger sample sizes will be required to detect individual variants reliably.	 16622805 23756893 12372655 6160987 12499854 11306251 19185213 16862161 2858999 20155392 10069554 23624490 22562716 5883730 22745707 21779269 15274050 18974851 21683760 11891318 10639180 1755520 25387709 15878265 14962576 12711923 10360405 1713548 16887192 8912107 10574286 10819022 9579706 12217970 20620877 8146253 10470973 19803776 3100270 20025927 8644716 21493755 9246556 9146819 17016156 11522462 3241870 10529019 1757667 22820512 11832222 14642484 25387703 19734902 16338015 3992243 19200528 22075736 6870482 15102499 16874763 15172204 16875773 12645817 16562401 12892855 16364064 20598278 19734903 17207817 10624730 21474944 18543122 22247735 20873220 21317682 21382410 16179502 24379779 2626519 15032992 23363460 11838534 22504417 10209231 23566244 1718711 15172130 19748744 2183880 12559224 20359884 2322623 11094142 2579798 7771661 8546153 12605099 7972603 24184042 16395124 18381357 17383039 15024690 15082461 16792556 14706488 17765604 16557364 17949392 24486144 18256235 21167468 18440057 20421487 19416820 23217325 21429736 24460875 23942779 2307762 1427795 16894595 24739435 17293007 16484051 24273134 1701118 8412148 23530921 20828426 19726643 8248447 21498463 2064719 20677839 20410729 11102670
25436638	Genetic variants associated with serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in European Americans and African Americans from the eMERGE Network.	Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) hormone levels are normally tightly regulated within an individual; thus, relatively small variations may indicate thyroid disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants in PDE8B and FOXE1 that are associated with TSH levels. However, prior studies lacked racial/ethnic diversity, limiting the generalization of these findings to individuals of non-European ethnicities. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network is a collaboration across institutions with biobanks linked to electronic medical records (EMRs). The eMERGE Network uses EMR-derived phenotypes to perform GWAS in diverse populations for a variety of phenotypes. In this report, we identified serum TSH levels from 4,501 European American and 351 African American euthyroid individuals in the eMERGE Network with existing GWAS data. Tests of association were performed using linear regression and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and principal components, assuming an additive genetic model. Our results replicate the known association of PDE8B with serum TSH levels in European Americans (rs2046045 p = 1.85×10-17, β = 0.09). FOXE1 variants, associated with hypothyroidism, were not genome-wide significant (rs10759944: p = 1.08×10-6, β = -0.05). No SNPs reached genome-wide significance in African Americans. However, multiple known associations with TSH levels in European ancestry were nominally significant in African Americans, including PDE8B (rs2046045 p = 0.03, β = -0.09), VEGFA (rs11755845 p = 0.01, β = -0.13), and NFIA (rs334699 p = 1.50×10-3, β = -0.17). We found little evidence that SNPs previously associated with other thyroid-related disorders were associated with serum TSH levels in this study. These results support the previously reported association between PDE8B and serum TSH levels in European Americans and emphasize the need for additional genetic studies in more diverse populations. 	 17970774 21367965 16189501 16862161 17384015 18727705 22125226 23344678 24448361 19198613 22882326 19179434 21234875 16915535 21162740 22493691 21841780 15663347 17547687 11867360 18514160 11836274 19312135 15466939 21981779 20534769 15870128 17684054 21893493 24854527 21269473 20826269 2109585 22560525 10724051 23408906 19730683 17530167 17701901 21317282 20373981 22494929 23314186 18611976 23149456 17709379 22147956
25387706	Heritability and molecular genetic basis of electrodermal activity: a genome-wide association study.	The molecular genetic basis of electrodermal activity (EDA) was analyzed using 527,829 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large population-representative sample of twins and parents (N = 4,424) in relation to various EDA indices. Biometric analyses suggested that approximately 50% or more of variance in all EDA indices was heritable. The combined effect of all SNPs together accounted for a significant amount of variance in each index, affirming their polygenic basis and heritability. However, none of the SNPs were genome-wide significant for any EDA index. Previously reported SNP associations with disorders such as substance dependence or schizophrenia, which have been linked to EDA abnormalities, were not significant; nor were associations between EDA and genes in specific neurotransmitter systems. These results suggest that EDA is influenced by multiple genes rather than by polymorphisms with large effects.	 23756893 3353484 10641584 23592651 534667 16862161 17698042 9715103 17995911 19875104 15869350 2241502 25387709 15250812 23258944 11117459 22646690 12108763 15099658 19788551 17420689 12144605 19803776 2960997 14175287 15468096 571619 12668349 21999673 15189473 6450959 25387703 17723027 7485621 18796187 14523630 23297790 7291438 6356201 25387710 20598278 9844425 21945549 6470315 19917592 464640 4853643 7897056 10624730 21474944 23826906 22247735 18355393 7291440 23363460 18683185 20595427 6838333 21167468 12860774 23217325 9500310 7057175 20828426 4013868 13527784 21498463 22777127
25468567	A genome-wide association study of susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adolescents and young adults (AYA) is characterized by distinct presenting features and inferior prognosis compared with pediatric ALL. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to comprehensively identify inherited genetic variants associated with susceptibility to AYA ALL. In the discovery GWAS, we compared genotype frequency at 635 297 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 308 AYA ALL cases and 6,661 non-ALL controls by using a logistic regression model with genetic ancestry as a covariate. SNPs that reached P ≤ 5 × 10(-8) in GWAS were tested in an independent cohort of 162 AYA ALL cases and 5,755 non-ALL controls. We identified a single genome-wide significant susceptibility locus in GATA3: rs3824662, odds ratio (OR), 1.77 (P = 2.8 × 10(-10)) and rs3781093, OR, 1.73 (P = 3.2 × 10(-9)). These findings were validated in the replication cohort. The risk allele at rs3824662 was most frequent in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like ALL but also conferred susceptibility to non-Ph-like ALL in AYAs. In 1,827 non-selected ALL cases, the risk allele frequency at this SNP was positively correlated with age at diagnosis (P = 6.29 × 10(-11)). Our results from this first GWAS of AYA ALL susceptibility point to unique biology underlying leukemogenesis and potentially distinct disease etiology by age group. 	 21629213 25207766 21037568 21297632 21502085 22388572 10835412 11483573 12011421 14617512 14749784 15024967 15055306 14551133 9557602 15481055 16467884 16556888 16987886 17503334 17701901 18445843 18388178 18502832 18776909 19006567 19176441 19553647 19571809 19571811 19684603 19684604 20453839 20139093 20660823 20466853 20876426 22291082 21632975 22412151 22897847 23007406 23512250 23559026 23523389 23757222 23996088 24141364 24007213 22237106
25469926	Novel loci associated with usual sleep duration: the CHARGE Consortium Genome-Wide Association Study.	Usual sleep duration is a heritable trait correlated with psychiatric morbidity, cardiometabolic disease and mortality, although little is known about the genetic variants influencing this trait. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of usual sleep duration was conducted using 18 population-based cohorts totaling 47 180 individuals of European ancestry. Genome-wide significant association was identified at two loci. The strongest is located on chromosome 2, in an intergenic region 35- to 80-kb upstream from the thyroid-specific transcription factor PAX8 (lowest P=1.1 × 10(-9)). This finding was replicated in an African-American sample of 4771 individuals (lowest P=9.3 × 10(-4)). The strongest combined association was at rs1823125 (P=1.5 × 10(-10), minor allele frequency 0.26 in the discovery sample, 0.12 in the replication sample), with each copy of the minor allele associated with a sleep duration 3.1 min longer per night. The alleles associated with longer sleep duration were associated in previous GWAS with a more favorable metabolic profile and a lower risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these associations may help elucidate biological mechanisms influencing sleep duration and its association with psychiatric, metabolic and cardiovascular disease. 	 20858683 18263651 18974171 17372189 22941192 20400780 15800623 16084776 20167617 18464913 2267475 20031568 6684786 20815195 10543671 22253318 8464434 16085466 2646917 15864280 11232563 1678444 23449886 23814337 21966062 23021865 21877163 20616382 20935630 21926974 6075589 23453885 1825458 20383146 21829388 9545414 22472876 1208363 21784243 22426310 16251536 20732625 22105623 7862179 23408906 19679812 20470391 17903308 21112019 22531031 21129726 1669507 20081858 14819398 20191932 18321246 20149345
25500335	A genome-wide association study of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated red blood cell fatty acids in the Framingham Heart Offspring Study.	Most genome-wide association studies have explored relationships between genetic variants and plasma phospholipid fatty acid proportions, but few have examined apparent genetic influences on the membrane fatty acid profile of red blood cells (RBC). Using RBC fatty acid data from the Framingham Offspring Study, we analyzed over 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with 14 RBC fatty acids identifying 191 different SNPs associated with at least 1 fatty acid. Significant associations (p<1×10(-8)) were located within five distinct 1MB regions. Of particular interest were novel associations between (1) arachidonic acid and PCOLCE2 (regulates apoA-I maturation and modulates apoA-I levels), and (2) oleic and linoleic acid and LPCAT3 (mediates the transfer of fatty acids between glycerolipids). We also replicated previously identified strong associations between SNPs in the FADS (chromosome 11) and ELOVL (chromosome 6) regions. Multiple SNPs explained 8-14% of the variation in 3 high abundance (>11%) fatty acids, but only 1-3% in 4 low abundance (<3%) fatty acids, with the notable exception of dihomo-gamma linolenic acid with 53% of variance explained by SNPs. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which variations in these genes influence tissue fatty acid content and pathways modulated by fatty acids. 	 12393877 21771977 19421317 19043545 19033007 18841286 20031568 18460914 7295999 22727409 17943122 24079284 9129511 17616765 12612178 18435934 24490074 17903291 3196218 18442630 19671931 20686565 22916037 20551373 19826053 24460221 21829377 22359512 22216341 11157321 22503634 19735181 12530552 20339536 21886157 22607825 5641616 6491529 14610053 21058334 19351971 24453077 20364269 19010253 20139978 22748167 24141362 22371413 24842322 23222517 19185299 22139419 19237735 23362303 9519336 19148276 22666496

25475840	A twin study of breastfeeding with a preliminary genome-wide association scan.	Breastfeeding has been an important survival trait during human history, though it has long been recognized that individuals differ in their exact breastfeeding behavior. Here our aims were, first, to explore to what extent genetic and environmental influences contributed to the individual differences in breastfeeding behavior; second, to detect possible genetic variants related to breastfeeding; and lastly, to test if the genetic variants associated with breastfeeding have been previously found to be related with breast size. Data were collected from a large community-based cohort of Australian twins, with 3,364 women participating in the twin modelling analyses and 1,521 of them included in the genome-wide association study (GWAS). Monozygotic (MZ) twin correlations (r MZ = 0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.57) were larger than dizygotic (DZ) twin correlations (r DZ = 0.35, 95% CI 0.25-0.43) and the best-fitting model was the one composed by additive genetics and unique environmental factors, explaining 53% and 47% of the variance in breastfeeding behavior, respectively. No breastfeeding-related genetic variants reached genome-wide significance. The polygenic risk score analyses showed no significant results, suggesting breast size does not influence breastfeeding. This study confers a replication of a previous one exploring the sources of variance of breastfeeding and, to our knowledge, is the first one to conduct a GWAS on breastfeeding and look at the overlap with variants for breast size. 	 22765355 20691247 16467284 21933193 22580735 23919294 23398685 17666009 19094257 15811106 21366865 15724882 18300295 18819238 19910520 10860662 21788656 18254911 17254422 21434834 17983998 16881928 23941164 9403910 22747683 19538614 20598278 19896111 14624720 21767302 10801388 17701901 14595868 8567849 17924335 22965645 21507050 21156270 21383846 18184094 23046559 16886951

25483131	T2DM GWAS in the Lebanese population confirms the role of TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 in disease susceptibility.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of multiple populations with distinctive genetic and lifestyle backgrounds are crucial to the understanding of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology. We report a GWAS on the genetic basis of T2DM in a 3,286 Lebanese participants. More than 5,000,000 SNPs were directly genotyped or imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panels. We identify genome-wide significant variants in two loci CDKAL1 and TCF7L2, independent of sex, age and BMI, with leading variants rs7766070 (OR = 1.39, P = 4.77 × 10(-9)) and rs34872471 (OR = 1.35, P = 1.01 × 10(-8)) respectively. The current study is the first GWAS to find genomic regions implicated in T2DM in the Lebanese population. The results support a central role of CDKAL1 and TCF7L2 in T2DM susceptibility in Southwest Asian populations and provide a plausible component for understanding molecular mechanisms involved in the disease. 	 22216278 16887799 21874001 18285412 22511877 23128226 20418489 17463249 19008344 23382925 24435973 22344221 20981037 20691447 22119613 22325160 20818381 23107111 21820751 15525634 1339870 20581827 2086279 20517342 22158537 24788070 22474029 23945395 17463248 15855610 18711366 22885924 18477659 17554300 22693455 20634204 20980453 17701901 23269371 23188737 20174558 18372903 22293688 19648217 16155576 23300278 20926424 22885922 20862305 20016592 24145053 22017296 19543373 23717210 11855950 20081858 15823385 23468648

25493955	Genome-wide association study of kidney function decline in individuals of European descent.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple loci associated with cross-sectional eGFR, but a systematic genetic analysis of kidney function decline over time is missing. Here we conducted a GWAS meta-analysis among 63,558 participants of European descent, initially from 16 cohorts with serial kidney function measurements within the CKDGen Consortium, followed by independent replication among additional participants from 13 cohorts. In stage 1 GWAS meta-analysis, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at MEOX2, GALNT11, IL1RAP, NPPA, HPCAL1, and CDH23 showed the strongest associations for at least one trait, in addition to the known UMOD locus, which showed genome-wide significance with an annual change in eGFR. In stage 2 meta-analysis, the significant association at UMOD was replicated. Associations at GALNT11 with Rapid Decline (annual eGFR decline of 3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or more), and CDH23 with eGFR change among those with CKD showed significant suggestive evidence of replication. Combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analyses showed significance for UMOD, GALNT11, and CDH23. Morpholino knockdowns of galnt11 and cdh23 in zebrafish embryos each had signs of severe edema 72 h after gentamicin treatment compared with controls, but no gross morphological renal abnormalities before gentamicin administration. Thus, our results suggest a role in the deterioration of kidney function for the loci GALNT11 and CDH23, and show that the UMOD locus is significantly associated with kidney function decline. 	 19274077 22947327 23344477 23622250 24185693 24226769 11138009 19270079 19520754 19535543 19541818 19745105 19892932 19892934 19838659 20383145 20383146 20484896 20601685 19430482 20861615 21139605 21282601 21245129 21931561 21980298 23028342 22143329 22155946 22284441 22479191 22297672 22548739 22699706 22797727 11138008 22764191 11090341 11315092 11979335 12407180 14970063 9545414 9806915 15664230 16102746 16251469 17555489 17986697 18467141 19001197 18706747

25514360	Genome-Wide Association Study Identification of Novel Loci Associated with Airway Responsiveness in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.	Increased airway responsiveness is linked to lung function decline and mortality in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, the genetic contribution to airway responsiveness remains largely unknown. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) Human660W-Quad BeadChip on European Americans with COPD from the Lung Health Study. Linear regression models with correlated meta-analyses, including data from baseline (n = 2,814) and Year 5 (n = 2,657), were used to test for common genetic variants associated with airway responsiveness. Genotypic imputation was performed using reference 1000 Genomes Project data. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses in lung tissues were assessed for the top 10 markers identified, and immunohistochemistry assays assessed protein staining for SGCD and MYH15. Four genes were identified within the top 10 associations with airway responsiveness. Markers on chromosome 9p21.2 flanked by LINGO2 met a predetermined threshold of genome-wide significance (P < 9.57 × 10(-8)). Markers on chromosomes 3q13.1 (flanked by MYH15), 5q33 (SGCD), and 6q21 (PDSS2) yielded suggestive evidence of association (9.57 × 10(-8) < P ≤ 4.6 × 10(-6)). Gene expression studies in lung tissue showed single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosomes 5 and 3 to act as eQTL for SGCD (P = 2.57 × 10(-9)) and MYH15 (P = 1.62 × 10(-6)), respectively. Immunohistochemistry confirmed localization of SGCD protein to airway smooth muscle and vessels and MYH15 to airway epithelium, vascular endothelium, and inflammatory cells. We identified novel loci associated with airway responsiveness in a GWAS among smokers with COPD. Risk alleles on chromosomes 5 and 3 acted as eQTLs for SGCD and MYH15 messenger RNA, and these proteins were expressed in lung cells relevant to the development of airway responsiveness. 	 2874759 6538209 3318599 1736734 8500311 8637302 8665038 9167458 16264044 16862161 17065372 17701901 18046902 18073581 17993586 18462017 19023099 19752551 19948655 22986903 24081222 23984888 10673175 10852754 11073020 11919279 12169177 12354338 12644718 12907528 20132157 20634204 20369371 20935112 21287203 22007139 22267756 22523354 23209423 3537079
25524916	Genetic Variants Associated With Quantitative Glucose Homeostasis Traits Translate to Type 2 Diabetes in Mexican Americans: The GUARDIAN (Genetics Underlying Diabetes in Hispanics) Consortium.	Insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, insulin clearance, and glucose effectiveness exhibit strong genetic components, although few studies have examined their genetic architecture or influence on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. We hypothesized that loci affecting variation in these quantitative traits influence T2D. We completed a multicohort genome-wide association study to search for loci influencing T2D-related quantitative traits in 4,176 Mexican Americans. Quantitative traits were measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (four cohorts) or euglycemic clamp (three cohorts), and random-effects models were used to test the association between loci and quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, and admixture proportions (Discovery). Analysis revealed a significant (P < 5.00 × 10(-8)) association at 11q14.3 (MTNR1B) with acute insulin response. Loci with P < 0.0001 among the quantitative traits were examined for translation to T2D risk in 6,463 T2D case and 9,232 control subjects of Mexican ancestry (Translation). Nonparametric meta-analysis of the Discovery and Translation cohorts identified significant associations at 6p24 (SLC35B3/TFAP2A) with glucose effectiveness/T2D, 11p15 (KCNQ1) with disposition index/T2D, and 6p22 (CDKAL1) and 11q14 (MTNR1B) with acute insulin response/T2D. These results suggest that T2D and insulin secretion and sensitivity have both shared and distinct genetic factors, potentially delineating genomic components of these quantitative traits that drive the risk for T2D. 	 19060907 17317761 19017771 19641896 19734900 10806194 11136689 12196473 12684185 12865761 15220212 443421 382871 6389599 2864297 3640682 3546379 3289989 19808919 20081857 2684710 2229309 8425661 8635647 8875104 17463246 17554300 20081858 20040588 21647700 21632466 22581228 23506862 23223351 23715323 23874508 24390345 24124113 20581827 20805282 20820957 20886378 21142536 21441907 9545414 10364681 15793265 15829238 16938560 19060908

25521368	Genome wide meta-analysis highlights the role of genetic variation in RARRES2 in the regulation of circulating serum chemerin.	Chemerin is an adipokine proposed to link obesity and chronic inflammation of adipose tissue. Genetic factors determining chemerin release from adipose tissue are yet unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for serum chemerin in three independent cohorts from Europe: Sorbs and KORA from Germany and PPP-Botnia from Finland (total N = 2,791). In addition, we measured mRNA expression of genes within the associated loci in peripheral mononuclear cells by micro-arrays, and within adipose tissue by quantitative RT-PCR and performed mRNA expression quantitative trait and expression-chemerin association studies to functionally substantiate our loci. Heritability estimate of circulating chemerin levels was 16.2% in the Sorbs cohort. Thirty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosome 7 within the retinoic acid receptor responder 2 (RARRES2)/Leucine Rich Repeat Containing (LRRC61) locus reached genome-wide significance (p<5.0×10-8) in the meta-analysis (the strongest evidence for association at rs7806429 with p = 7.8×10-14, beta = -0.067, explained variance 2.0%). All other SNPs within the cluster were in linkage disequilibrium with rs7806429 (minimum r2 = 0.43 in the Sorbs cohort). The results of the subgroup analyses of males and females were consistent with the results found in the total cohort. No significant SNP-sex interaction was observed. rs7806429 was associated with mRNA expression of RARRES2 in visceral adipose tissue in women (p<0.05 after adjusting for age and body mass index). In conclusion, the present meta-GWAS combined with mRNA expression studies highlights the role of genetic variation in the RARRES2 locus in the regulation of circulating chemerin concentrations. 	 17982457 14530373 18846210 19303973 19474294 19497986 19470637 19855132 19729412 19910529 20237162 20454776 3899825 16032514 16096270 16381825 16862161 16632515 17463246 17635925 17640997 17660554 17873874 20424419 21106904 21559053 21798003 22216169 22383892 22955989 22982016 22907691 24795087 11315860 18060068

25705162	Genome-wide association study identifies candidate Loci associated with platelet count in koreans.	Platelets are derived from the fragments that are formed from the cytoplasm of bone marrow megakaryocytes-small irregularly shaped anuclear cells. Platelets respond to vascular damage, contracts blood vessels, and attaches to the damaged region, thereby stopping bleeding, together with the action of blood coagulation factors. Platelet activation is known to affect genes associated with vascular risk factors, as well as with arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study with 352,228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in 8,842 subjects of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project and replicated the results in 7,861 subjects from an independent population. We identified genetic associations between platelet count and common variants nearby chromosome 4p16.1 (p = 1.46 × 10(-10), in the KIAA0232 gene), 6p21 (p = 1.36 × 10(-7), in the BAK1 gene), and 12q24.12 (p = 1.11 × 10(-15), in the SH2B3 gene).

25705158	Pathway Analysis of Metabolic Syndrome Using a Genome-Wide Association Study of Korea Associated Resource (KARE) Cohorts.	Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder related to insulin resistance, obesity, and inflammation. Genetic and environmental factors also contribute to the development of MetS, and through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), important susceptibility loci have been identified. However, GWASs focus more on individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), explaining only a small portion of genetic heritability. To overcome this limitation, pathway analyses are being applied to GWAS datasets. The aim of this study is to elucidate the biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of MetS through pathway analysis. Cohort data from the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) was used for analysis, which include 8,842 individuals (age, 52.2 ± 8.9 years; body mass index, 24.6 ± 3.2 kg/m(2)). A total of 312,121 autosomal SNPs were obtained after quality control. Pathway analysis was conducted using Meta-analysis Gene-Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (MAGENTA) to discover the biological pathways associated with MetS. In the discovery phase, SNPs from chromosome 12, including rs11066280, rs2074356, and rs12229654, were associated with MetS (p < 5 × 10(-6)), and rs11066280 satisfied the Bonferroni-corrected cutoff (unadjusted p < 1.38 × 10(-7), Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.05). Through pathway analysis, biological pathways, including electron carrier activity, signaling by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase cascade, PDGF binding, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling, and DNA repair, were associated with MetS. Through pathway analysis of MetS, pathways related with PDGF, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PPAR signaling, as well as nucleic acid binding, protein secretion, and DNA repair, were identified. Further studies will be needed to clarify the genetic pathogenesis leading to MetS. 	 18445357 20930846 15716906 22840561 24427322 22302470 22825314 21085203 22791748 16244653 18059211 16306381 20043036 24010743 21946517 17878249 23351195 22383865 17804914 22963884 22140493 12485966 24350922 24404510 22022282 17161265 22399527 15972579 17434869 17919180 15450427 15616005 21386085 9302300 19793375 20935630 20932114 17468095 9498630 17116180 18655850 15231970 18587394 24575141 18388693 17463248 22486214 24142389 16652134 12351431 16157765 23954331 8884570 21486521 17553506 23593258 20824171 24559154 17701901 20074509 18372903 16459310 14990339 20714348 19396169 12778163 21909109 22480918 18309108 9753710 12832613 23140642 18024526 22885922 21533175 21270382 15733737 17032725 20725711 14988273 20705925
25551457	No evidence for genome-wide interactions on plasma fibrinogen by smoking, alcohol consumption and body mass index: results from meta-analyses of 80,607 subjects.	Plasma fibrinogen is an acute phase protein playing an important role in the blood coagulation cascade having strong associations with smoking, alcohol consumption and body mass index (BMI). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a variety of gene regions associated with elevated plasma fibrinogen concentrations. However, little is yet known about how associations between environmental factors and fibrinogen might be modified by genetic variation. Therefore, we conducted large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide interaction studies to identify possible interactions of genetic variants and smoking status, alcohol consumption or BMI on fibrinogen concentration. The present study included 80,607 subjects of European ancestry from 22 studies. Genome-wide interaction analyses were performed separately in each study for about 2.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the 22 autosomal chromosomes. For each SNP and risk factor, we performed a linear regression under an additive genetic model including an interaction term between SNP and risk factor. Interaction estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed-effects model. No genome-wide significant interaction with smoking status, alcohol consumption or BMI was observed in the meta-analyses. The most suggestive interaction was found for smoking and rs10519203, located in the LOC123688 region on chromosome 15, with a p value of 6.2 × 10(-8). This large genome-wide interaction study including 80,607 participants found no strong evidence of interaction between genetic variants and smoking status, alcohol consumption or BMI on fibrinogen concentrations. Further studies are needed to yield deeper insight in the interplay between environmental factors and gene variants on the regulation of fibrinogen concentrations.	 10747348 7957500 11315092 11460508 12669113 12877910 12958120 15042128 2889959 1616903 8165611 7796826 8651228 9001796 13434757 15785300 15817606 16219884 16614319 17572673 17785713 18385738 18772067 18780872 20031568 20031576 20031577 20548021 20616382 21058334 23034020 23969696 11197396

Circulating levels of these biomarkers have a heritable component (between 13% and 56%), but the underlying genetic variation influencing these biomarker levels is largely unknown.	 12151533 21167468 21257790 21572414 21520010 22003120 22010135 22387998 21824113 22504417 22963146 23381943 23901057 12624629 21239051 24288371 6373375 9204896 13032504 16225862 16862161 16849318 17202813 17349880 17466941 17372189 17634421 17935811 18274928 18464913 18604267 18974171 19123972 19360663 19223316 19584346 19648918 19812666 19729612 20031568 20040588 20231535 20167578 20348331 20526338 20599737 20981092 21058334 20971884 20167617
25824743	A pilot genome-wide association study of breast cancer susceptibility loci in Indonesia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of the entire genome provide a systematic approach for revealing novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. However, genetic association studies have hitherto been primarily conducted in women of European ancestry. Therefofre we here performed a pilot GWAS with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 5.0 platform from Affymetrix® that contains 443,813 SNPs to search for new genetic risk factors in 89 breast cancer cases and 46 healthy women of Indonesian ancestry. The case-control association of the GWAS finding set was evaluated using PLINK. The strengths of allelic and genotypic associations were assessed using logistic regression analysis and reported as odds ratios (ORs) and P values; P values less than 1.00x10(-8) and 5.00x10(-5) were required for significant association and suggestive association, respectively. After analyzing 292,887 SNPs, we recognized 11 chromosome loci that possessed suggestive associations with breast cancer risk. Of these, however, there were only four chromosome loci with identified genes: chromosome 2p.12 with the CTNNA2 gene [Odds ratio (OR)=1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-1.33, P=1.08x10(-7)]; chromosome 18p11.2 with the SOGA2 gene (OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.17-1.44, P=6.88x10(-6)); chromosome 5q14.1 with the SSBP2 gene (OR=1.22, 95%CI=1.11-1.34, P=4.00x10(-5)); and chromosome 9q31.1 with the TEX10 gene (OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.12-1.35, P=4.68x10(-5)). This study identified 11 chromosome loci which exhibited suggestive associations with the risk of breast cancer among Indonesian women.

Numerous experimental studies suggest that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is cardioprotective; however, in clinical studies, higher plasma BNP concentrations have been associated with incident cardiovascular disease and higher left ventricular mass. Genetic association studies may allow us to determine the true causal directions without confounding by compensatory mechanisms.	 23184379 3521732 16216958 10737768 11031105 11300427 2522777 1671381 1864303 1659877 8207362 7657802 8879350 8952587 9654038 9682046 9715795 9863839 15643134 16317982 17318641 17340039 17412758 17452510 17719005 17903293 18322158 19219041 19326473 19377085 19715440 20233392 20400780 12417542 20634204 20616382 12821537 21364112 21276798 21273288 21824924 22039354 12135939 23381795
25574825	Genome-wide comparative analysis of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis gives insight into opposing genetic mechanisms.	Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are the two most common immune-mediated inflammatory disorders affecting the skin. Genome-wide studies demonstrate a high degree of genetic overlap, but these diseases have mutually exclusive clinical phenotypes and opposing immune mechanisms. Despite their prevalence, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis very rarely co-occur within one individual. By utilizing genome-wide association study and ImmunoChip data from >19,000 individuals and methodologies developed from meta-analysis, we have identified opposing risk alleles at shared loci as well as independent disease-specific loci within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21.3), the Th2 locus control region (chromosome 5q31.1), and the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6p21-22). We further identified previously unreported pleiotropic alleles with opposing effects on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis risk in PRKRA and ANXA6/TNIP1. In contrast, there was no evidence for shared loci with effects operating in the same direction on both diseases. Our results show that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis have distinct genetic mechanisms with opposing effects in shared pathways influencing epidermal differentiation and immune response. The statistical analysis methods developed in the conduct of this study have produced additional insight from previously published data sets. The approach is likely to be applicable to the investigation of the genetic basis of other complex traits with overlapping and distinct clinical features. 	 22125221 22197932 22138821 18677311 19169253 19169254 19169255 19384417 19349984 19501237 18642345 19638999 19714648 20004782 20953186 20953188 20953189 20953190 22560090 22571556 22808063 23042114 23128226 22914738 23143594 23293357 23201690 23014338 23151849 23223131 23727859 23886662 24053642 24449016 25087609 20089530 19812592 20176734 20376060 20616382 20634204 10573234 10988289 11279517 7918017 7751469 15608641 15507446 16032514 16490960 16550169 17255953 17572673 17410197 17658397 17701901 18179884 18369459 21300701 21501829 21282207 21388665 21346775 21666691 21490620 21774711

25884002	Phenome-wide Association Study Relating Pretreatment Laboratory Parameters With Human Genetic Variants in AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocols.	Background.  Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) identify genetic associations across multiple phenotypes. Clinical trials offer opportunities for PheWAS to identify pharmacogenomic associations. We describe the first PheWAS to use genome-wide genotypic data and to utilize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical trials data. As proof-of-concept, we focused on baseline laboratory phenotypes from antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals. Methods.  Data from 4 AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) studies were split into 2 datasets: Dataset I (1181 individuals from protocol A5202) and Dataset II (1366 from protocols A5095, ACTG 384, and A5142). Final analyses involved 2547 individuals and 5 954 294 imputed polymorphisms. We calculated comprehensive associations between these polymorphisms and 27 baseline laboratory phenotypes. Results.  A total of 10 584 (0.17%) polymorphisms had associations with P < .01 in both datasets and with the same direction of association. Twenty polymorphisms replicated associations with identical or related phenotypes reported in the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies, including several not previously reported in HIV-positive cohorts. We also identified several possibly novel associations. Conclusions.  These analyses define PheWAS properties and principles with baseline laboratory data from HIV clinical trials. This approach may be useful for evaluating on-treatment HIV clinical trials data for associations with various clinical phenotypes. 	 21347282 19474294 10592173 20335276 15115831 24131735 16170755 24378202 20139798 14668455 21646302 19169254 23752797 15622315 23080225 17804789 19952143 19238117 21162740 16905783 21051598 20339536 21829377 18480202 15297300 20228799 20694148 25566314 18256392 21505298 21738479 21594894 17701901 23269371 23382687 23642732 20981092 17235330 19543373 19180233 21320923
25575512	Evidence for several independent genetic variants affecting lipoprotein (a) cholesterol levels.	Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis-related events that is under strong genetic control (heritability = 0.68-0.98). However, causal mutations and functional validation of biological pathways modulating Lp(a) metabolism are lacking. We performed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with Lp(a)-cholesterol levels in the Old Order Amish. We confirmed a previously known locus on chromosome 6q25-26 and found Lp(a) levels also to be significantly associated with a SNP near the APOA5-APOA4-APOC3-APOA1 gene cluster on chromosome 11q23 linked in the Amish to the APOC3 R19X null mutation. On 6q locus, we detected associations of Lp(a)-cholesterol with 118 common variants (P = 5 × 10(-8) to 3.91 × 10(-19)) spanning a ∼5.3 Mb region that included the LPA gene. To further elucidate variation within LPA, we sequenced LPA and identified two variants most strongly associated with Lp(a)-cholesterol, rs3798220 (P = 1.07 × 10(-14)) and rs10455872 (P = 1.85 × 10(-12)). We also measured copy numbers of kringle IV-2 (KIV-2) in LPA using qPCR. KIV-2 numbers were significantly associated with Lp(a)-cholesterol (P = 2.28 × 10(-9)). Conditional analyses revealed that rs3798220 and rs10455872 were associated with Lp(a)-cholesterol levels independent of each other and KIV-2 copy number. Furthermore, we determined for the first time that levels of LPA mRNA were higher in the carriers than non-carriers of rs10455872 (P = 0.0001) and were not different between carriers and non-carriers of rs3798220. Protein levels of apo(a) were higher in the carriers than non-carriers of both rs10455872 and rs3798220. In summary, we identified multiple independent genetic determinants for Lp(a)-cholesterol. These findings provide new insights into Lp(a) regulation. 	 19124843 17133260 19299407 19557197 20032323 20354512 20447543 20517342 21311511 21592478 21930939 22930834 23278389 22998429 24941081 24941082 25078778 8640397 17369523 17569884 17943122 18440328 18612205 18560444 19074352 19198611 19060253 10672142 9925666 11285247 11368702 11590547 11698280 12451008 12824425 12865733 934323 6228142 2932366 3957004 3670400 1531481 1336760 8503012 8138718 8598109 9006799 9050779 9521925 10449652 15621217 16549089 17110240 19509380

25581431	Identification of six new susceptibility loci for invasive epithelial ovarian cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) susceptibility alleles. The pattern of association at these loci is consistent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who are at high risk of EOC. After imputation to 1000 Genomes Project data, we assessed associations of 11 million genetic variants with EOC risk from 15,437 cases unselected for family history and 30,845 controls and from 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers (3,096 with ovarian cancer), and we combined the results in a meta-analysis. This new study design yielded increased statistical power, leading to the discovery of six new EOC susceptibility loci. Variants at 1p36 (nearest gene, WNT4), 4q26 (SYNPO2), 9q34.2 (ABO) and 17q11.2 (ATAD5) were associated with EOC risk, and at 1p34.3 (RSPO1) and 6p22.1 (GPX6) variants were specifically associated with the serous EOC subtype, all with P < 5 × 10(-8). Incorporating these variants into risk assessment tools will improve clinical risk predictions for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. 	 19010876 21169536 19648918 19648919 19755857 20147293 20360942 20583289 21482675 21720365 21901109 22144499 21618528 21169538 21297984 21610668 22138821 22253144 22351618 22361336 22588877 22714938 22961099 23128226 22642827 23142796 23535648 23535730 23535731 23544012 23544013 23550210 24119843 24277755 24907074 22443200 11696420 12352190 12917631 15073127 15111326 15077121 8688336 8875917 9637117 15655247 16845085 16885336 17041600 17466083 17999359 18086700 18250097 18428421 18371299 20616382 20852631 20852632 20852633 19543373
25628645	Identification of genetic variants or genes that are associated with Homoharringtonine (HHT) response through a genome-wide association study in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).	Homoharringtonine (HHT) has been widely used in China to treat patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia for decades. Since response to HHT varies among patients, our study aimed to identify biomarkers that might influence the response to HHT using a panel of various human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and mRNA expression data was assessed for association with cytotoxicity to HHT in LCLs. Integrated analysis among SNPs, expression, AUC value was also performed to help select candidate genes for further functional characterization. Functional validation of candidate genes was performed using leukemia cell lines (U937, K562). Candidate genes were knocked down using specific siRNA and its response to HHT was assessed using MTS assay. We found that 15 expression probes were associated with HHT AUC with P < 10(-4), and 96 individual probe sets with P < 10(-3). Eighteen SNPs were associated with HHT AUC with P < 10(-5) and 281 SNPs with P < 10(-4). The integrated analysis identified 4 unique SNPs that were associated with both expression and AUC. Functional validation using siRNA knockdown in leukemia cell lines showed that knocking down CCDC88A, CTBP2, SOCS4 genes in U937 and K562 cells significantly altered HHT cytotoxicity. In summary, this study performed with LCLs can help to identify novel biomarker that might contribute to variation in response to HHT therapy. 	 19732725 16862161 15166021 21483441 21072045 19951971 23664707 16546987 8745664 19224581 18757419 11237013 19668232 23790799 15224352 21428770 23885323 17924348 17537913 19898621 19043577 20923822 19339911 15269782 17943131 24009623 15282376

25599974	A genome-wide association study of early spontaneous preterm delivery.	Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive research, the genetic contributions to spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) are not well understood. Term controls were matched with cases by race/ethnicity, maternal age, and parity prior to recruitment. Genotyping was performed using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 assays. Statistical analyses utilized PLINK to compare allele occurrence rates between case and control groups, and incorporated quality control and multiple-testing adjustments. We analyzed DNA samples from mother-infant pairs from early SPTB cases (20(0/7)-33(6/7) weeks, 959 women and 979 neonates) and term delivery controls (39(0/7)-41(6/7) weeks, 960 women and 985 neonates). For validation purposes, we included an independent validation cohort consisting of early SPTB cases (293 mothers and 243 infants) and term controls (200 mothers and 149 infants). Clustering analysis revealed no population stratification. Multiple maternal SNPs were identified with association P-values between 10×10(-5) and 10×10(-6). The most significant maternal SNP was rs17053026 on chromosome 3 with an odds ratio (OR) 0.44 with a P-value of 1.0×10(-6). Two neonatal SNPs reached the genome-wide significance threshold, including rs17527054 on chromosome 6p22 with a P-value of 2.7×10(-12) and rs3777722 on chromosome 6q27 with a P-value of 1.4×10(-10). However, we could not replicate these findings after adjusting for multiple comparisons in a validation cohort. This is the first report of a genome-wide case-control study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correlate with SPTB.	 10938173 19854802 20647212 23032486 10684911 17701901 24321416 14976157 8232435 16301860 16679958 10933736
25649181	Identifying genetic loci associated with antidepressant drug response with drug-gene interaction models in a population-based study.	It has been difficult to identify genes affecting drug response to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). We used multiple cross-sectional assessments of depressive symptoms in a population-based study to identify potential genetic interactions with SSRIs as a model to study genetic variants associated with SSRI response. This study, embedded in the prospective Rotterdam Study, included all successfully genotyped participants with data on depressive symptoms (CES-D scores). We used repeated measurement models to test multiplicative interaction between genetic variants and use of SSRIs on repeated CESD scores. Besides a genome-wide analysis, we also performed an analysis which was restricted to genes related to the serotonergic signaling pathway. A total of 273 out of 14,937 assessments of depressive symptoms in 6443 participants, use of an SSRI was recorded. After correction for multiple testing, no plausible loci were identified in the genome-wide analysis. However, among the top 10 independent loci with the lowest p-values, findings within two genes (FSHR and HMGB4) might be of interest. Among 26 genes related to the serotonergic signaling pathway, the rs6108160 polymorphism in the PLCB1 gene reached statistical significance after Bonferroni correction (p-value = 8.1e-5). Also, the widely replicated 102C > T polymorphism in the HTR2A gene showed a statistically significant drug-gene interaction with SSRI use. Therefore, the present study suggests that drug-gene interaction models on (repeated) cross-sectional assessments of depressive symptoms in a population-based study can identify potential loci that may influence SSRI response.	
25601762	Pharmacodynamic genome-wide association study identifies new responsive loci for glucocorticoid intervention in asthma.	Asthma is a chronic lung disease that has a high prevalence. The therapeutic intervention of this disease can be made more effective if genetic variability in patients' response to medications is implemented. However, a clear picture of the genetic architecture of asthma intervention response remains elusive. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify drug response-associated genes for asthma, in which 909 622 SNPs were genotyped for 120 randomized participants who inhaled multiple doses of glucocorticoids. By integrating pharmacodynamic properties of drug reactions, we implemented a mechanistic model to analyze the GWAS data, enhancing the scope of inference about the genetic architecture of asthma intervention. Our pharmacodynamic model observed associations of genome-wide significance between dose-dependent response to inhaled glucocorticoids (measured as %FEV1) and five loci (P=5.315 × 10(-7) to 3.924 × 10(-9)), many of which map to metabolic genes related to lung function and asthma risk. All significant SNPs detected indicate a recessive effect, at which the homozygotes for the mutant alleles drive variability in %FEV1. Significant associations were well replicated in three additional independent GWAS studies. Pooled together over these three trials, two SNPs, chr6 rs6924808 and chr11 rs1353649, display an increased significance level (P=6.661 × 10(-16) and 5.670 × 10(-11)). Our study reveals a general picture of pharmacogenomic control for asthma intervention. The results obtained help to tailor an optimal dose for individual patients to treat asthma based on their genetic makeup.	 16646852 20488563 19264689 11315092 18923164 12016099 9642256 15263889 23857381 19706858 19749758 18976728 21269481 12079279 21920452 17611496 11368732 18535201 19228618 21987090 16132700 18650507 19749757 19348697 20010834 19027726 20860503 19483685 8884266 20647212 15782224 19578179 21211646 10452521 20300088 20714161 16614226 18387595 15937480 19684573 20010835 21798579 21991891 19300499 12559768 15829533 20402387 15134635 17392331

25607358	Common genetic variants influence human subcortical brain structures.	The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction. 	 11315092 20613723 22083728 22504421 22031440 11832223 23258944 25056061 21618601 22856370 23011133 21903076 23435227 20881960 20613842 22820512 20616382 20935630 23201973 23359524 11252776 7892610 19029888 11404412 20980389 20421462 22373907 15654335 11731797 21058334 11399427 23193294 7711769 7878471 22504417 20162602 11734855 19858363 21848658 25174004 19171779 14997420 8817568 16929307 22433082 21102431 21397060 21441907 22504418 11271378 23296188 22958900 18243105 21352927 24013639
25608926	Genome-wide meta-analysis in alopecia areata resolves HLA associations and reveals two new susceptibility loci.	Alopecia areata (AA) is a prevalent autoimmune disease with 10 known susceptibility loci. Here we perform the first meta-analysis of research on AA by combining data from two genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and replication with supplemented ImmunoChip data for a total of 3,253 cases and 7,543 controls. The strongest region of association is the major histocompatibility complex, where we fine-map four independent effects, all implicating human leukocyte antigen-DR as a key aetiologic driver. Outside the major histocompatibility complex, we identify two novel loci that exceed the threshold of statistical significance, containing ACOXL/BCL2L11(BIM) (2q13); GARP (LRRC32) (11q13.5), as well as a third nominally significant region SH2B3(LNK)/ATXN2 (12q24.12). Candidate susceptibility gene expression analysis in these regions demonstrates expression in relevant immune cells and the hair follicle. We integrate our results with data from seven other autoimmune diseases and provide insight into the alignment of AA within these disorders. Our findings uncover new molecular pathways disrupted in AA, including autophagy/apoptosis, transforming growth factor beta/Tregs and JAK kinase signalling, and support the causal role of aberrant immune processes in AA. 	 20192991 21151127 23737756 19904770 16490960 21346773 20927229 7791384 24037378 23455425 21852963 22897480 20560212 23064249 22534877 20596022 21364673 16032514 12177636 12499113 23762245 23217709 17804836 17529973 22278742 17401363 18425901 11709185 21984578 22286218 15337988 10674369 10934149 24831815 17701901 15136663 21990094 16935791 19666573 19651619 19750484
25616667	Genetic variants are major determinants of CSF antibody levels in multiple sclerosis.	Immunological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis include the production of antibodies in the central nervous system, expressed as presence of oligoclonal bands and/or an increased immunoglobulin G index-the level of immunoglobulin G in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to serum. However, the underlying differences between oligoclonal band-positive and -negative patients with multiple sclerosis and reasons for variability in immunoglobulin G index are not known. To identify genetic factors influencing the variation in the antibody levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in multiple sclerosis, we have performed a genome-wide association screen in patients collected from nine countries for two traits, presence or absence of oligoclonal bands (n = 3026) and immunoglobulin G index levels (n = 938), followed by a replication in 3891 additional patients. We replicate previously suggested association signals for oligoclonal band status in the major histocompatibility complex region for the rs9271640*A-rs6457617*G haplotype, correlated with HLA-DRB1*1501, and rs34083746*G, correlated with HLA-DQA1*0301 (P comparing two haplotypes = 8.88 × 10(-16)). Furthermore, we identify a novel association signal of rs9807334, near the ELAC1/SMAD4 genes, for oligoclonal band status (P = 8.45 × 10(-7)). The previously reported association of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus with immunoglobulin G index reaches strong evidence for association in this data set (P = 3.79 × 10(-37)). We identify two novel associations in the major histocompatibility complex region with immunoglobulin G index: the rs9271640*A-rs6457617*G haplotype (P = 1.59 × 10(-22)), shared with oligoclonal band status, and an additional independent effect of rs6457617*G (P = 3.68 × 10(-6)). Variants identified in this study account for up to 2-fold differences in the odds of being oligoclonal band positive and 7.75% of the variation in immunoglobulin G index. Both traits are associated with clinical features of disease such as female gender, age at onset and severity. This is the largest study population so far investigated for the genetic influence on antibody levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in multiple sclerosis, including 6950 patients. We confirm that genetic factors underlie these antibody levels and identify both the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin heavy chain region as major determinants. 	 20694011 23225573 21280076 21300701 21750679 21829393 21833088 24076602 23834430 24449572 24736746 24099750 24763718 24601691 21093933 11041329 11456302 11673319 11796767 12601107 12905478 4113225 6847134 9702693 10378864 15688346 15824338 15958092 15800022 16009268 17000979 16945427 17438020 17606883 17701901 17881717 18970977 19457560 19846760 19879597 20383147 23378332 23472185 23528543 23785401 23431079 21418440 21728174 22542470 22185806 23326239
25628336	Genetic variants associated with motion sickness point to roles for inner ear development, neurological processes and glucose homeostasis.	Roughly one in three individuals is highly susceptible to motion sickness and yet the underlying causes of this condition are not well understood. Despite high heritability, no associated genetic factors have been discovered. Here, we conducted the first genome-wide association study on motion sickness in 80 494 individuals from the 23andMe database who were surveyed about car sickness. Thirty-five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with motion sickness at a genome-wide-significant level (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Many of these SNPs are near genes involved in balance, and eye, ear and cranial development (e.g. PVRL3, TSHZ1, MUTED, HOXB3, HOXD3). Other SNPs may affect motion sickness through nearby genes with roles in the nervous system, glucose homeostasis or hypoxia. We show that several of these SNPs display sex-specific effects, with up to three times stronger effects in women. We searched for comorbid phenotypes with motion sickness, confirming associations with known comorbidities including migraines, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), vertigo and morning sickness and observing new associations with altitude sickness and many gastrointestinal conditions. We also show that two of these related phenotypes (PONV and migraines) share underlying genetic factors with motion sickness. These results point to the importance of the nervous system in motion sickness and suggest a role for glucose levels in motion-induced nausea and vomiting, a finding that may provide insight into other nausea-related phenotypes like PONV. They also highlight personal characteristics (e.g. being a poor sleeper) that correlate with motion sickness, findings that could help identify risk factors or treatments. 	 17463246 21858135 8825456 3390095 20585627 22833723 7646403 22272317 20852632 21769484 17463249 21907224 21666692 17586487 19262165 22509285 19117548 18250548 22493691 22824679 19605361 22130514 17460697 20935630 24972930 11243726 11912185 22815809 20436461 16950658 16639285 19419665 22747683 22166413 17956732 19564336 10048305 17463248 17086768 23768516 17293876 22138695 16950946 23035051 22733100 16313141 23722164 20416353 3002315 18485739 18812463 24860089 12962599
25625606	Investigating the genetics of hippocampal volume in older adults without dementia.	Hippocampal atrophy is observed with ageing and age-related neurodegenerative disease. Identification of the genetic correlates of hippocampal volume (HV) and atrophy may assist in elucidating the mechanisms of ageing and age-related neurodegeneration. Using two community cohorts of older Caucasians we estimated the heritability of HV and examined associations of HV with previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition we undertook genome-association studies (GWAS) examining HV and HV atrophy. Participants were community-dwelling non-demented older adults from the longitudinal Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS) (N = 498) and the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) (N = 351) aged 65 and over. HV was measured using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Heritability of HV was estimated in OATS. Genome-wide genotyping was imputed using the 1K Genomes reference set. Associations with HV-candidate and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related SNPs were investigated. A GWAS examining HV (in both cohorts) and an exploratory GWAS of HV atrophy over two years (in Sydney MAS only) were also undertaken. HV heritability was estimated at 62-65%. The previously identified GWAS HV SNP (rs6581612) and the candidate BDNF SNP (rs6265) were nominally significant (p = 0.047 and p = 0.041 respectively). No AD-related SNPs, including the APOE ε4 polymorphism, were significant. No significant results were observed for either of the GWAS undertaken. Despite our estimate of a high heritability of HV, our results are consistent with a highly polygenic model suggesting that SNPs identified from prior studies, including GWAS meta-analyses, can be difficult to replicate in smaller samples of older adults. 	 12377157 21979382 16862161 15501092 22504421 22701550 19059349 22395804 15074306 22856370 19715440 20409609 23770413 23734114 20616382 23959201 14735112 11731797 19405132 23152815 21058334 22504417 22745009 17701901 22815222 11811670 17389798 24231518 21352927 20637138 19943720
25625282	Identification and functional characterization of G6PC2 coding variants influencing glycemic traits define an effector transcript at the G6PC2-ABCB11 locus.	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) for fasting glucose (FG) and insulin (FI) have identified common variant signals which explain 4.8% and 1.2% of trait variance, respectively. It is hypothesized that low-frequency and rare variants could contribute substantially to unexplained genetic variance. To test this, we analyzed exome-array data from up to 33,231 non-diabetic individuals of European ancestry. We found exome-wide significant (P<5×10-7) evidence for two loci not previously highlighted by common variant GWAS: GLP1R (p.Ala316Thr, minor allele frequency (MAF)=1.5%) influencing FG levels, and URB2 (p.Glu594Val, MAF = 0.1%) influencing FI levels. Coding variant associations can highlight potential effector genes at (non-coding) GWAS signals. At the G6PC2/ABCB11 locus, we identified multiple coding variants in G6PC2 (p.Val219Leu, p.His177Tyr, and p.Tyr207Ser) influencing FG levels, conditionally independent of each other and the non-coding GWAS signal. In vitro assays demonstrate that these associated coding alleles result in reduced protein abundance via proteasomal degradation, establishing G6PC2 as an effector gene at this locus. Reconciliation of single-variant associations and functional effects was only possible when haplotype phase was considered. In contrast to earlier reports suggesting that, paradoxically, glucose-raising alleles at this locus are protective against type 2 diabetes (T2D), the p.Val219Leu G6PC2 variant displayed a modest but directionally consistent association with T2D risk. Coding variant associations for glycemic traits in GWAS signals highlight PCSK1, RREB1, and ZHX3 as likely effector transcripts. These coding variant association signals do not have a major impact on the trait variance explained, but they do provide valuable biological insights. 	 23383060 24894501 19082990 23508304 19643913 15265697 17056598 23274894 15965027 20160197 22286214 22182842 24443550 19060907 20616382 20354512 16120945 22373025 16757948 18521185 24509480 17327461 18556336 10810087 18451265 22885924 17098089 23840762 22728672 22038520 21457909 21907014 21737059 19561590 24463508 24497850 24336170 20562413 22885922 22581228 20081858 20208533
25631615	Meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies Identifies Novel Loci Associated With Optic Disc Morphology.	Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common optic neuropathy and an important cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The optic nerve head or optic disc is divided in two parts: a central cup (without nerve fibers) surrounded by the neuroretinal rim (containing axons of the retinal ganglion cells). The International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies consisting of 17,248 individuals of European ancestry and 6,841 individuals of Asian ancestry. The outcomes of the genome-wide association studies were disc area and cup area. These specific measurements describe optic nerve morphology in another way than the vertical cup-disc ratio, which is a clinically used measurement, and may shed light on new glaucoma mechanisms. We identified 10 new loci associated with disc area (CDC42BPA, F5, DIRC3, RARB, ABI3BP, DCAF4L2, ELP4, TMTC2, NR2F2, and HORMAD2) and another 10 new loci associated with cup area (DHRS3, TRIB2, EFEMP1, FLNB, FAM101, DDHD1, ASB7, KPNB1, BCAS3, and TRIOBP). The new genes participate in a number of pathways and future work is likely to identify more functions related to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. 	 23291589 23500522 24016867 25241763 11148140 2335441 1582806 1302030 16723438 17572673 17652737 19836009 20395239 20548946 20598278 20616382 20634204 20851442 21058334 21307088 21528004 21427129 21532571 22058429 22570617
25629512	New loci and coding variants confer risk for age-related macular degeneration in East Asians.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness, but presents differently in Europeans and Asians. Here, we perform a genome-wide and exome-wide association study on 2,119 patients with exudative AMD and 5,691 controls, with independent replication in 4,226 patients and 10,289 controls, all of East Asian descent, as part of The Genetics of AMD in Asians (GAMA) Consortium. We find a strong association between CETP Asp442Gly (rs2303790), an East Asian-specific mutation, and increased risk of AMD (odds ratio (OR)=1.70, P=5.60 × 10(-22)). The AMD risk allele (442Gly), known to protect from coronary heart disease, increases HDL cholesterol levels by 0.17 mmol l(-1) (P=5.82 × 10(-21)) in East Asians (n=7,102). We also identify three novel AMD loci: C6orf223 Ala231Ala (OR=0.78, P=6.19 × 10(-18)), SLC44A4 Asp47Val (OR=1.27, P=1.08 × 10(-11)) and FGD6 Gln257Arg (OR=0.87, P=2.85 × 10(-8)). Our findings suggest that some of the genetic loci conferring AMD susceptibility in East Asians are shared with Europeans, yet AMD in East Asians may also have a distinct genetic signature. 	 12067718 22955616 12499305 12588754 12824425 14563342 1718250 8408659 7962532 16050460 17572673 17701901 17576744 18193044 19060906 19543373 19995197 19854291 20354512 20385819 20221623 20642364 19620884 21499248 21665990 21909106 22699862 22922875 22961001 23050023 23263489 23455636 23685748 24013639 23938127 24036949 24036950 24036952 25104651 12427645 11759279 22019782 22081228 22150050 22064851 22159171 22559899 22820512 22955989 10712410 10677542
25631608	Low-frequency and rare exome chip variants associate with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes susceptibility.	Fasting glucose and insulin are intermediate traits for type 2 diabetes. Here we explore the role of coding variation on these traits by analysis of variants on the HumanExome BeadChip in 60,564 non-diabetic individuals and in 16,491 T2D cases and 81,877 controls. We identify a novel association of a low-frequency nonsynonymous SNV in GLP1R (A316T; rs10305492; MAF=1.4%) with lower FG (β=-0.09±0.01 mmol l(-1), P=3.4 × 10(-12)), T2D risk (OR[95%CI]=0.86[0.76-0.96], P=0.010), early insulin secretion (β=-0.07±0.035 pmolinsulin mmolglucose(-1), P=0.048), but higher 2-h glucose (β=0.16±0.05 mmol l(-1), P=4.3 × 10(-4)). We identify a gene-based association with FG at G6PC2 (pSKAT=6.8 × 10(-6)) driven by four rare protein-coding SNVs (H177Y, Y207S, R283X and S324P). We identify rs651007 (MAF=20%) in the first intron of ABO at the putative promoter of an antisense lncRNA, associating with higher FG (β=0.02±0.004 mmol l(-1), P=1.3 × 10(-8)). Our approach identifies novel coding variant associations and extends the allelic spectrum of variation underlying diabetes-related quantitative traits and T2D susceptibility. 	 17463246 18521185 18678614 24633158 24584071 18227114 22955616 22843986 23169631 23193274 23201682 23263489 23332584 23508304 23715323 23874508 23770607 23843252 24443550 24497850 24439111 24507774 24507775 11235915 11532186 12037407 14968294 6023769 2106931 19420381 19444816 19451168 19505943 19643913 19841474 20031568 20081857 20081858 20138963 20581827 20519560 20686565 20714348 21378990 21478889 21301490 21653522 21616920 22038520 22072383 22262069 22239737 22582263 22581228 21844879 22604720 22604722 22885922 22885924 24509480 7673398 8636266 8898756 16222654 16293642 17098089 17257284
25637523	ARHGEF12 influences the risk of glaucoma by increasing intraocular pressure.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a blinding disease. Two important risk factors for this disease are a positive family history and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which is also highly heritable. Genes found to date associated with IOP and POAG are ABCA1, CAV1/CAV2, GAS7 and TMCO1. However, these genes explain only a small part of the heritability of IOP and POAG. We performed a genome-wide association study of IOP in the population-based Rotterdam Study I and Rotterdam Study II using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) imputed to 1000 Genomes. In this discovery cohort (n = 8105), we identified a new locus associated with IOP. The most significantly associated SNP was rs58073046 (β = 0.44, P-value = 1.87 × 10(-8), minor allele frequency = 0.12), within the gene ARHGEF12. Independent replication in five population-based studies (n = 7471) resulted in an effect size in the same direction that was significantly associated (β = 0.16, P-value = 0.04). The SNP was also significantly associated with POAG in two independent case-control studies [n = 1225 cases and n = 4117 controls; odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, P-value = 1.99 × 10(-8)], especially with high-tension glaucoma (OR = 1.66, P-value = 2.81 × 10(-9); for normal-tension glaucoma OR = 1.29, P-value = 4.23 × 10(-2)). ARHGEF12 plays an important role in the RhoA/RhoA kinase pathway, which has been implicated in IOP regulation. Furthermore, it binds to ABCA1 and links the ABCA1, CAV1/CAV2 and GAS7 pathway to Mendelian POAG genes (MYOC, OPTN, WDR36). In conclusion, this study identified a novel association between IOP and ARHGEF12.

25637336	Genetics of hand grip strength in mid to late life.	Hand grip strength (GS) is a predictor of mortality in older adults and is moderately to highly heritable, but no genetic variants have been consistently identified. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with GS in middle-aged to older adults using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GS was measured using handheld dynamometry in community-dwelling men and women aged 55-85 from the Hunter Community Study (HCS, N = 2088) and the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS, N = 541). Genotyping was undertaken using Affymetrix microarrays with imputation to HapMap2. Analyses were performed using linear regression. No genome-wide significant results were observed in HCS nor were any of the top signals replicated in Sydney MAS. Gene-based analyses in HCS identified two significant genes (ZNF295, C2CD2), but these results were not replicated in Sydney MAS. One out of eight SNPs previously associated with GS, rs550942, located near the CNTF gene, was significantly associated with GS (p = 0.005) in the HCS cohort only. Study differences may explain the lack of consistent results between the studies, including the smaller sample size of the Sydney MAS cohort. Our modest sample size also had limited power to identify variants of small effect. Our results suggest that similar to various other complex traits, many genetic variants of small effect size may influence GS. Future GWAS using larger samples and consistent measures may prove more fruitful at identifying genetic contributors for GS in middle-aged to older adults. 	 19129352 9952403 15272419 24097068 12446294 22865205 14574146 23052040 24825563 19715440 21769735 20083555 16696750 23423909 20616382 20708281 22792080 16406245 11053339 20598278 20813793 22211568 19570815 20233392 1952800 21058334 11247915 25032678 21336965 22253814 19478476 23395730 20056765 20219767 22743239 12214305 22499766 20637138 21567248
25642632	Discovery of six new susceptibility loci and analysis of pleiotropic effects in leprosy.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the discovery of several susceptibility loci for leprosy with robust evidence, providing biological insight into the role of host genetic factors in mycobacterial infection. However, the identified loci only partially explain disease heritability, and additional genetic risk factors remain to be discovered. We performed a 3-stage GWAS of leprosy in the Chinese population using 8,313 cases and 16,017 controls. Besides confirming all previously published loci, we discovered six new susceptibility loci, and further gene prioritization analysis of these loci implicated BATF3, CCDC88B and CIITA-SOCS1 as new susceptibility genes for leprosy. A systematic evaluation of pleiotropic effects demonstrated a high tendency for leprosy susceptibility loci to show association with autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. Further analysis suggests that molecular sensing of infection might have a similar pathogenic role across these diseases, whereas immune responses have discordant roles in infectious and inflammatory diseases. 	
25646370	Genome-wide association study of clinically defined gout identifies multiple risk loci and its association with clinical subtypes.	Gout, caused by hyperuricaemia, is a multifactorial disease. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of gout have been reported, they included self-reported gout cases in which clinical information was insufficient. Therefore, the relationship between genetic variation and clinical subtypes of gout remains unclear. Here, we first performed a GWAS of clinically defined gout cases only.	 23522044 22879516 22517333 9000692 10817569 11309308 11473043 11981327 12111919 12958120 14685227 14763408 15014177 14739288 4413418 856219 3802833 16820040 17517696 17696755 17978814 18223201 18327256 18327257 17997608 18556336 18759275 18834626 19026395 19265014 19503597 19506252 19526250 19851339 19926891 20081858 20139978 20368174 19556210 20502693 20595659 20884846 21768215 21909109 21983786 22132964 22348008 22473008 22293688 22797727 23263486 23774753 24509406 8910292 23563609
25649651	Genetic Determinants of Survival in Patientswith Alzheimer’s Disease.	There is a strong genetic basis for late-onset of Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), and thus far >20 genes/loci have been identified that affect the risk of LOAD. In addition to disease risk, genetic variation at these loci may also affect components of the natural history of AD, such as survival in AD. In this study, we first examined the role of known LOAD genes with survival time in 983 AD patients. We then performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-based association analyses to identify novel loci that may influence survival of AD. Survival analysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression under an additive genetics model. We found multiple nominally significant associations (p < 0.01) either within or adjacent to known LOAD genes. Genome-wide SNP analysis identified multiple suggestive novel loci and two of them were also significant in gene-based analysis (CCDC85C and NARS2) that survived after controlling for false-discovery rate at 0.05. In summary, we have identified two novel genes for survival in AD that need to be replicated in independent samples. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on AD-related phenotypes that may help to identify additional genes relevant toAD.	 21460841 9153523 7617191 9740117 23482655 22005931 23724096 22356904 8618662 23150934 21371747 11060507 16461860 7793228 16327343 3435081 6707407 7755355 22899317 17420099 15667381 21255795 15068977 19734902 10449114 2810583 9305343 11940690 15883266 24922517 16814429 15748779 11297701 20598278 21460840 4000483 19734903 22832961 10367700 22056358 24162737 2025148 20460622 18288934 12433264 19087313 7772075 7936239 8075646 18981370
25644384	Genetic contributions to variation in general cognitive function: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in the CHARGE consortium (N=53949).	General cognitive function is substantially heritable across the human life course from adolescence to old age. We investigated the genetic contribution to variation in this important, health- and well-being-related trait in middle-aged and older adults. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 31 cohorts (N=53,949) in which the participants had undertaken multiple, diverse cognitive tests. A general cognitive function phenotype was tested for, and created in each cohort by principal component analysis. We report 13 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in three genomic regions, 6q16.1, 14q12 and 19q13.32 (best SNP and closest gene, respectively: rs10457441, P=3.93 × 10(-9), MIR2113; rs17522122, P=2.55 × 10(-8), AKAP6; rs10119, P=5.67 × 10(-9), APOE/TOMM40). We report one gene-based significant association with the HMGN1 gene located on chromosome 21 (P=1 × 10(-6)). These genes have previously been associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Meta-analysis results are consistent with a polygenic model of inheritance. To estimate SNP-based heritability, the genome-wide complex trait analysis procedure was applied to two large cohorts, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (N=6617) and the Health and Retirement Study (N=5976). The proportion of phenotypic variation accounted for by all genotyped common SNPs was 29% (s.e.=5%) and 28% (s.e.=7%), respectively. Using polygenic prediction analysis, ~1.2% of the variance in general cognitive function was predicted in the Generation Scotland cohort (N=5487; P=1.5 × 10(-17)). In hypothesis-driven tests, there was significant association between general cognitive function and four genes previously associated with Alzheimer's disease: TOMM40, APOE, ABCG1 and MEF2C.	 23437142 15924306 15584785 23974872 21315185 8446617 20562875 22031440 23110764 26168413 18976728 21417532 20466522 24468470 10413680 23358156 22009741 15668424 20881960 20145623 24246418 22054870 19734902 22258510 25201988 12198535 21037248 24548926 19768548 10508514 22138206 19285755 24944428 19231028 20598278 21460840 23902936 19734903 19948260 23124102 12746393 25188341 21826061 20029386 17846257 24162737 23722424 18053258 23207651 22566634 19294424 21079607 22955989 7999320 20460622 18672097 17701901 24618891 12093377 22513993 23274270 8346443 22243964 23408798 19586182 22089642 17100509 17906170 22581228 24357886 21244145
25656473	Genome-wide association study of lymphoblast cell viability after clozapine exposure.	Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia but also known to induce potentially lethal agranulocytosis (CIA) in 1% of patients. Genetic factors are likely to play a role in the molecular basis of CIA. We explored an in vitro system to study the genetic susceptibility of CIA. Cell viability was measured in 90 lymphoblast cell lines exposed to a series of increasing concentrations of clozapine for 48 hr. Quantitative trait measures of cell viability as well as area under the survival curve were used in a linear mixed model for genome-wide association analyses. The estimated heritability of clozapine-induced cell viability reduction in these cell lines is h2=0.76. No genome-wide significant association was observed after correction for multiple testing. Two independent loci with nominal evidence of association were observed at 30× clinical clozapine concentration: rs2709505 (P=1.41×10(-8)) in an intron of MDFIC and rs10457252 (P=1.79×10(-8)) located in a gene desert at chromosome 6q21. We identified one locus (rs1293970) near PRG4 that was consistently associated for all separate concentration analyses at P<5×10(-5). PRG4 encodes hemangiopoietin, a growth stimulator for hematopoietic stem cells. No evidence was observed for involvement of the MHC region. Our results demonstrate that clozapine-induced viability reduction in lymphoblast cell lines is a heritable, polygenic trait. Thus, in vitro models of CIA might be a useful tool for future discovery of genetic risk factors, although larger sample sizes will be required to unambiguously identify these loci.

25672763	IKZF1, a new susceptibility gene for cold medicine-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis with severe mucosal involvement.	Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and its severe form, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are acute inflammatory vesiculobullous reactions of the skin and mucous membranes, including the ocular surface, oral cavity, and genitals. These reactions are very rare but are often associated with inciting drugs, infectious agents, or both.	
25672891	A genome-wide association study of periodontitis in a Japanese population.	Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease in which bacterial, lifestyle, and genetic factors are involved. Although previous genetic association studies identified several susceptibility genes for periodontitis in European populations, there is little information for Asian populations. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study and a replication study consisting of 2,760 Japanese periodontitis patients and 15,158 Japanese controls. Although single-nucleotide polymorphisms that surpassed a stringent genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10(-8)) were not identified, we found 2 suggestive loci for periodontitis: KCNQ5 on chromosome 6q13 (rs9446777, P = 4.83 × 10(-6), odds ratio = 0.82) and GPR141-NME8 at chromosome 7p14.1 (rs2392510, P = 4.17 × 10(-6), odds ratio = 0.87). A stratified analysis indicated that the GPR141-NME8 locus had a strong genetic effect on the susceptibility to generalized periodontitis in Japanese individuals with a history of smoking. In conclusion, this study identified 2 suggestive loci for periodontitis in a Japanese population. This study should contribute to a further understanding of genetic factors for enhanced susceptibility to periodontitis. 	
25673412	New genetic loci link adipose and insulin biology to body fat distribution.	Body fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P < 5 × 10(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms. 	 21909115 21067998 12716671 16271645 11315092 24097068 19474294 20189936 10592173 23399447 23132118 22876189 12111919 17668372 18193045 20562875 20714348 20372150 23128226 19597783 17943122 11158468 20944595 21142453 23104008 20125193 22936215 19734545 20881960 23563608 17344885 22955616 18332882 24035587 25282103 19615119 21102462 22267201 20616382 15448684 23641348 23754948 20935629 23202125 15755822 21399633 21102463 15924147 19557189 22545021 19005195 22589738 21151130 9545414 22589742 18830075 22885924 21802375 22426310 24762786 22539988 20139978 24093674 17701901 22479191 21833088 22080510 22139419 22479202 20981092 21167468 22325453 20228789 23805408 21355061 23028890 17664243 25673413 22504420 25597830 22885922 10802651 20081857 14685227 22581228 22970944 20889312 17875489 18927548 16595560
25673413	Genetic studies of body mass index yield new insights for obesity biology.	Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for ∼2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis. 	 19079261 19424496 19474294 19557189 20081857 20354512 20346437 20714348 20616382 22243964 20634204 20601685 20944595 22297845 22267201 22344219 22426310 22419158 22885924 22955616 22941192 23028342 23128226 23104008 23001569 23202125 23303927 23341774 23563607 23583978 23737753 23754948 23950990 24013639 24097068 22963884 23823329 24762786 25282103 25597830 25581432 25673412 20881960 20935630 21102462 21167468 21293372 21355061 21706003 21829388 21925320 21909115 22479191 22479202 22581228 22484627 22721967 22844493 22876189 22936215 22885922 10768293 11315092 11337480 14992287 9519560 16469695 17668372 17873877 17943122 17982457 18344981
25713168	15q12 variants, sputum gene promoter hypermethylation, and lung cancer risk: a GWAS in smokers.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Detection of promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in exfoliated cells from the lung provides an assessment of field cancerization that in turn predicts lung cancer. The identification of genetic determinants for this validated cancer biomarker should provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying epigenetic reprogramming during lung carcinogenesis.	 15343277 20159108 18385676 18670299 18704159 18726118 20929901 20448051 22139380 22510351 22986146 21976407 22801776 22899653 23485993 24032348 24405663 24572595 24739678 25079552 3719049 9288087 10357855 15389768 15657147 15956212 16415888 16338174 16540689 16807237 17124180 17364682 17339270 17589520 18413776 4810100 18635890 19836008 20068159 17616978
25705849	A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies the Skin Color Genes IRF4, MC1R, ASIP, and BNC2 Influencing Facial Pigmented Spots.	Facial pigmented spots are a common skin aging feature, but genetic predisposition has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We conducted a genome-wide association study for pigmented spots in 2,844 Dutch Europeans from the Rotterdam Study (mean age: 66.9±8.0 years; 47% male). Using semi-automated image analysis of high-resolution digital facial photographs, facial pigmented spots were quantified as the percentage of affected skin area (mean women: 2.0% ±0.9, men: 0.9% ±0.6). We identified genome-wide significant association with pigmented spots at three genetic loci: IRF4 (rs12203592, P=1.8 × 10(-27)), MC1R (compound heterozygosity score, P=2.3 × 10(-24)), and RALY/ASIP (rs6059655, P=1.9 × 10(-9)). In addition, after adjustment for the other three top-associated loci the BNC2 locus demonstrated significant association (rs62543565, P=2.3 × 10(-8)). The association signals observed at all four loci were successfully replicated (P<0.05) in an independent Dutch cohort (Leiden Longevity Study n=599). Although the four genes have previously been associated with skin color variation and skin cancer risk, all association signals remained highly significant (P<2 × 10(-8)) when conditioning the association analyses on skin color. We conclude that genetic variations in IRF4, MC1R, RALY/ASIP, and BNC2 contribute to the acquired amount of facial pigmented spots during aging, through pathways independent of the basal melanin production. 	 22071478 21270109 18483556 23548203 17222061 22189269 23128226 17952075 11487574 18488026 24917043 2186781 23223146 445877 11493097 19340012 20585627 21700618 7851112 2084007 12437451 2071226 24258680 19059763 20881960 21787368 25282103 22512251 19578363 18488028 1550366 11254446 22336944 16827749 23052946 22140526 23587773 21058334 19578364 16721784 17701901 16251894 22924836 22879455 22217736 15140067 16445772 24869959 9382570 18252221 19956599
25706626	A common variant mapping to CACNA1A is associated with susceptibility to exfoliation syndrome.	Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is the most common recognizable cause of open-angle glaucoma worldwide. To better understand the etiology of XFS, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,484 cases and 1,188 controls from Japan and followed up the most significant findings in a further 6,901 cases and 20,727 controls from 17 countries across 6 continents. We discovered a genome-wide significant association between a new locus (CACNA1A rs4926244) and increased susceptibility to XFS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, P = 3.36 × 10(-11)). Although we also confirmed overwhelming association at the LOXL1 locus, the key SNP marker (LOXL1 rs4886776) demonstrated allelic reversal depending on the ancestry group (Japanese: OR(A allele) = 9.87, P = 2.13 × 10(-217); non-Japanese: OR(A allele) = 0.49, P = 2.35 × 10(-31)). Our findings represent the first genetic locus outside of LOXL1 surpassing genome-wide significance for XFS and provide insight into the biology and pathogenesis of the disease.	 18037624 18036875 18334928 18334947 18254956 18385063 18385788 18287813 18483563 18552979 18450598 19373106 20431720 20616382 20808326 21212179 21550405 22064851 22955989 24013639 24938310 24801512 18201684 19343041 19936304 20142848 10767326 11166342 11402393 11586304 12499305 8995426 16678509 17690259
25710614	Genome-wide association study identifies peanut allergy-specific loci and evidence of epigenetic mediation in US children.	Food allergy (FA) affects 2%-10% of US children and is a growing clinical and public health problem. Here we conduct the first genome-wide association study of well-defined FA, including specific subtypes (peanut, milk and egg) in 2,759 US participants (1,315 children and 1,444 parents) from the Chicago Food Allergy Study, and identify peanut allergy (PA)-specific loci in the HLA-DR and -DQ gene region at 6p21.32, tagged by rs7192 (P=5.5 × 10(-8)) and rs9275596 (P=6.8 × 10(-10)), in 2,197 participants of European ancestry. We replicate these associations in an independent sample of European ancestry. These associations are further supported by meta-analyses across the discovery and replication samples. Both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with differential DNA methylation levels at multiple CpG sites (P<5 × 10(-8)), and differential DNA methylation of the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 genes partially mediate the identified SNP-PA associations. This study suggests that the HLA-DR and -DQ gene region probably poses significant genetic risk for PA. 	 22197932 16862161 10887305 23042114 20838408 11918686 20718045 23052040 21804549 23443026 23431366 24042236 22777545 8227867 23845860 21277522 23094689 15536425 21804548 21377035 24495553 22257669 23762245 12058257 24478339 16802776 20860503 9641569 23684069 16646809 9515587 23817571 25174864 23970557 16632515 22568884 19851108 22552845 24656863 21666691 21134576 20850383 24762976 21489610 24388012 8621860 22848472 20180792 10385319 17701901 23817569 23269371 21602305 21747404 19016802 21300701 17668381 17873874 21118553 21740494 18846210 23334450 19543373 20220756 19473544

25101718	IREB2 and GALC are associated with pulmonary artery enlargement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Pulmonary hypertension is associated with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although pulmonary vascular changes occur early in the course of the disease. Pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement (PAE) measured by computed tomography correlates with pulmonary hypertension and COPD exacerbation frequency. Genome-wide association studies of PAE in subjects with COPD have not been reported. To investigate whether genetic variants are associated with PAE within subjects with COPD, we investigated data from current and former smokers from the COPDGene Study and the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints study. The ratio of the diameter of the PA to the diameter of the aorta (A) was measured using computed tomography. PAE was defined as PA/A greater than 1. A genome-wide association study for COPD with PAE was performed using subjects with COPD without PAE (PA/A ≤ 1) as a control group. A secondary analysis used smokers with normal spirometry as a control group. Genotyping was performed on Illumina platforms. The results were summarized using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Both meta-analyses revealed a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 15q25.1 in IREB2 (COPD with versus without PAE, rs7181486; odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; P = 2.10 × 10(-8); versus smoking control subjects, rs2009746; OR = 1.42; P = 1.32 × 10(-9)). PAE was also associated with a region on 14q31.3 near the GALC gene (rs7140285; OR = 1.55; P = 3.75 × 10(-8)). Genetic variants near IREB2 and GALC likely contribute to genetic susceptibility to PAE associated with COPD. This study provides evidence for genetic heterogeneity associated with a clinically important COPD vascular subtype. 	 19762597 20089972 19875683 20093532 20173748 20214461 20522579 20616382 20634204 21058334 20709820 22820512 22938715 22837378 23128226 22914670 22878278 23299987 23842577 23983033 23197103 24621683 21949713 22052925 22080838 11315092 11704589 11912177 11998991 12958120 15459136 5013974 453709 24114440 16850017 7271303 8306040 7750305 9192174 9988751 10524808 15852018 15888824 15831842 17384015 17701901 17889203 17890477 18048810 18216052 18565956 18852200 19300482 19433755 19800047 19762596

25742292	Genome-wide association study of parity in Bangladeshi women.	Human fertility is a complex trait determined by gene-environment interactions in which genetic factors represent a significant component. To better understand inter-individual variability in fertility, we performed one of the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common fertility phenotypes, lifetime number of pregnancies and number of children in a developing country population. The fertility phenotype data and DNA samples were obtained at baseline recruitment from individuals participating in a large prospective cohort study in Bangladesh. GWAS analyses of fertility phenotypes were conducted among 1,686 married women. One SNP on chromosome 4 was non-significantly associated with number of children at P <10(-7) and number of pregnancies at P <10(-6). This SNP is located in a region without a gene within 1 Mb. One SNP on chromosome 6 was non-significantly associated with extreme number of children at P <10(-6). The closest gene to this SNP is HDGFL1, a hepatoma-derived growth factor. When we excluded hormonal contraceptive users, a SNP on chromosome 5 was non-significantly associated at P <10(-5) for number of children and number of pregnancies. This SNP is located near C5orf64, an open reading frame, and ZSWIM6, a zinc ion binding gene. We also estimated the heritability of these phenotypes from our genotype data using GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) for number of children (hg2 = 0.149, SE = 0.24, p-value = 0.265) and number of pregnancies (hg2 = 0.007, SE = 0.22, p-value = 0.487). Our genome-wide association study and heritability estimates of number of pregnancies and number of children in Bangladesh did not confer strong evidence of common variants for parity variation. However, our results suggest that future studies may want to consider the role of 3 notable SNPs in their analysis.	 17612870 17701901 17924335 18200594 18603647 18989307 18805939 19861327 20103481 19822755 20208533 20509080 20562875 22383894 22742504 14575025 16466523 16160703 17511727 10670617 23217223 9644328
25758996	Genome-wide association analysis on five isolated populations identifies variants of the HLA-DOA gene associated with white wine liking.	Wine is the most popular alcoholic beverage around the world and because of its importance in society has been widely studied. Understanding what drives its flavor has been a quest for decades but much is still unknown and will be determined at least in part by individual taste preferences. Recently studies in the genetics of taste have uncovered the role of different genes in the determination of food preferences giving new insight on its physiology. In this context we have performed a genome-wide association study on red and white wine liking using three isolated populations collected in Italy, and replicated our results on two additional populations coming from the Netherland and Central Asia for a total of 3885 samples. We have found a significant association (P=2.1 × 10(-8)) between white wine liking and rs9276975:C>T a polymorphism in the HLA-DOA gene encoding a non-canonical MHC II molecule, which regulates other MHC II molecules. The same association was also found with red wine liking (P=8.3 × 10(-6)). Sex-separated analysis have also revealed that the effect of HLA-DOA is twice as large in women as compared to men suggesting an interaction between this polymorphism and gender. Our results are one of the first examples of genome-wide association between liking of a commonly consumed food and gene variants. Moreover, our results suggest a role of the MHC system in the determination of food preferences opening new insight in this field in general. 	 23799013 21934100 15777804 15716906 21163912 10769936 17384015 23128226 18322080 9364787 12499305 22064851 21493956 7630893 22084926 18949121 11511592 19322759 16939299 1678444 15809497 22977065 20201924 16406465 15845033 22820512 15547448 17250611 15325225 21354451 16672312 19935653 20202923 23743675 12639233 22951737 15054401 9881361 16047495 12070110 22714804 24263836 22138314 23269371 22004471 9326314 4528891 22888812 20158304 19543373
25758998	Genome-wide genetic investigation of serological measures of common infections.	Populations and individuals differ in susceptibility to infections because of a number of factors, including host genetic variation. We previously demonstrated that differences in antibody titer, which reflect infection history, are significantly heritable. Here we attempt to identify the genetic factors influencing variation in these serological phenotypes. Blood samples from >1300 Mexican Americans were quantified for IgG antibody level against 12 common infections, selected on the basis of their reported role in cardiovascular disease risk: Chlamydia pneumoniae; Helicobacter pylori; Toxoplasma gondii; cytomegalovirus; herpes simplex I virus; herpes simplex II virus; human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6); human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8); varicella zoster virus; hepatitis A virus (HAV); influenza A virus; and influenza B virus. Pathogen-specific quantitative antibody levels were analyzed, as were three measures of pathogen burden. Genome-wide linkage and joint linkage and association analyses were performed using ~1 million SNPs. Significant linkage (lod scores >3.0) was obtained for HHV6 (on chromosome 7), HHV8 (on chromosome 6), and HAV (on chromosome 13). SNP rs4812712 on chromosome 20 was significantly associated with C. pneumoniae (P=5.3 × 10(-8)). However, no genome-wide significant loci were obtained for the other investigated antibodies. We conclude that it is possible to localize host genetic factors influencing some of these antibody traits, but that further larger-scale investigations will be required to elucidate the genetic mechanisms contributing to variation in antibody levels. 	 11315092 9326339 16862161 921216 10955367 17414391 22018212 9392592 9433616 8901667 21996708 20427542 21993531 210392 20976024 16400619 11772870 10845851 11515035 3772018 9545414 9463399 23797960 21837478 21194924 19812685 23326239 21345357 8627710 23132731 12857923 19284285 16123354
25760438	First genome-wide association study in an Australian aboriginal population provides insights into genetic risk factors for body mass index and type 2 diabetes.	A body mass index (BMI) >22kg/m2 is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Aboriginal Australians. To identify loci associated with BMI and T2D we undertook a genome-wide association study using 1,075,436 quality-controlled single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped (Illumina 2.5M Duo Beadchip) in 402 individuals in extended pedigrees from a Western Australian Aboriginal community. Imputation using the thousand genomes (1000G) reference panel extended the analysis to 6,724,284 post quality-control autosomal SNPs. No associations achieved genome-wide significance, commonly accepted as P<5x10-8. Nevertheless, genes/pathways in common with other ethnicities were identified despite the arrival of Aboriginal people in Australia >45,000 years ago. The top hit (rs10868204 Pgenotyped = 1.50x10-6; rs11140653 Pimputed_1000G = 2.90x10-7) for BMI lies 5' of NTRK2, the type 2 neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that regulates energy balance downstream of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). PIK3C2G (rs12816270 Pgenotyped = 8.06x10-6; rs10841048 Pimputed_1000G = 6.28x10-7) was associated with BMI, but not with T2D as reported elsewhere. BMI also associated with CNTNAP2 (rs6960319 Pgenotyped = 4.65x10-5; rs13225016 Pimputed_1000G = 6.57x10-5), previously identified as the strongest gene-by-environment interaction for BMI in African-Americans. The top hit (rs11240074 Pgenotyped = 5.59x10-6, Pimputed_1000G = 5.73x10-6) for T2D lies 5' of BCL9 that, along with TCF7L2, promotes beta-catenin's transcriptional activity in the WNT signaling pathway. Additional hits occurred in genes affecting pancreatic (KCNJ6, KCNA1) and/or GABA (GABRR1, KCNA1) functions. Notable associations observed for genes previously identified at genome-wide significance in other populations included MC4R (Pgenotyped = 4.49x10-4) for BMI and IGF2BP2 Pimputed_1000G = 2.55x10-6) for T2D. Our results may provide novel functional leads in understanding disease pathogenesis in this Australian Aboriginal population. 	 10631157 11063431 11955446 23606227 10624965 12654723 11315092 21350161 17194218 9686693 16862161 23002136 22384356 24749055 16936727 17384015 23128226 22344219 12796784 11847087 24782328 21483673 19079261 22612818 23937595 20647267 21892150 21119644 23188401 12007727 23404445 7796919 22138821 22851474 2605247 18300295 17909099 23192594 23756614 23137000 21699402 24290566 20942671 11867360 2550826 14693042 22369086 20300623 22752552 20935630 23319617 19885641 23766565 20517342 17671651 21516613 18454146 24065655 17688984 24509480 15036253 17991425 22538358 18454148 15901920 20085713 24318934 22885924 25033443 11032837 21940856 20634204 23025733 23918046 21350160 12612586 11156618 20126254 11891299 22513296 16198769 24528214 11808873 17924335 18655717 21167468 21142536 9196049 17093941 23311614 23001569 22885922 14734327 22762219 23979933 10226929 19543373 19509021 15860560 18282631 20208533
25772935	Meta-analysis of 65,734 individuals identifies TSPAN15 and SLC44A2 as two susceptibility loci for venous thromboembolism.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE), the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, is a complex thrombotic disorder with environmental and genetic determinants. Although several genetic variants have been found associated with VTE, they explain a minor proportion of VTE risk in cases. We undertook a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify additional VTE susceptibility genes. Twelve GWASs totaling 7,507 VTE case subjects and 52,632 control subjects formed our discovery stage where 6,751,884 SNPs were tested for association with VTE. Nine loci reached the genome-wide significance level of 5 × 10(-8) including six already known to associate with VTE (ABO, F2, F5, F11, FGG, and PROCR) and three unsuspected loci. SNPs mapping to these latter were selected for replication in three independent case-control studies totaling 3,009 VTE-affected individuals and 2,586 control subjects. This strategy led to the identification and replication of two VTE-associated loci, TSPAN15 and SLC44A2, with lead risk alleles associated with odds ratio for disease of 1.31 (p = 1.67 × 10(-16)) and 1.21 (p = 2.75 × 10(-15)), respectively. The lead SNP at the TSPAN15 locus is the intronic rs78707713 and the lead SLC44A2 SNP is the non-synonymous rs2288904 previously shown to associate with transfusion-related acute lung injury. We further showed that these two variants did not associate with known hemostatic plasma markers. TSPAN15 and SLC44A2 do not belong to conventional pathways for thrombosis and have not been associated to other cardiovascular diseases nor related quantitative biomarkers. Our findings uncovered unexpected actors of VTE etiology and pave the way for novel mechanistic concepts of VTE pathophysiology. 	 24357727 24008160 24769558 18462017 21980494 22103505 22064851 22253303 22443383 22143225 18070814 24630777 18974171 19278955 11739647 11782049 15099278 15226180 2646917 1669507 8275211 7612801 7637142 15701913 16415888 16489055 16634748 16720835 17367492 19583818 20037594 20040764 20231535 20616382 20562444 20802025 21502573 21824919 22446964 22675575 22703881 22672568 22955989 23382694 23506897 23334152 23474282 23715323 23667179 23650146 23809115 23782616 23742623 23969696 24013639 24604202
25763902	Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis identify ISL1 as genome-wide significant susceptibility gene for bladder exstrophy.	The bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC) represents the severe end of the uro-rectal malformation spectrum, and is thought to result from aberrant embryonic morphogenesis of the cloacal membrane and the urorectal septum. The most common form of BEEC is isolated classic bladder exstrophy (CBE). To identify susceptibility loci for CBE, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 110 CBE patients and 1,177 controls of European origin. Here, an association was found with a region of approximately 220kb on chromosome 5q11.1. This region harbors the ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) gene. Multiple markers in this region showed evidence for association with CBE, including 84 markers with genome-wide significance. We then performed a meta-analysis using data from a previous GWAS by our group of 98 CBE patients and 526 controls of European origin. This meta-analysis also implicated the 5q11.1 locus in CBE risk. A total of 138 markers at this locus reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis, and the most significant marker (rs9291768) achieved a P value of 2.13 × 10-12. No other locus in the meta-analysis achieved genome-wide significance. We then performed murine expression analyses to follow up this finding. Here, Isl1 expression was detected in the genital region within the critical time frame for human CBE development. Genital regions with Isl1 expression included the peri-cloacal mesenchyme and the urorectal septum. The present study identified the first genome-wide significant locus for CBE at chromosomal region 5q11.1, and provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that ISL1 is the responsible candidate gene in this region. 	 3424208 3343652 1691825 8071977 8565076 9000074 10332476 15610117 16053904 16687132 17202190 17937426 19270707 19161161 19543373 19619559 19878548 20045748 20060941 20926424 21283718 22232429 21679965 11684660 22286218 22438573 22860096 23028455 22995555 23284286 23436999 23437000 23437001 23763947 23641053 23873040 23906961 23913486 24764164 24852367 12177636 10969846 12833402 12738808 14667410 15161765 6737583

The aim of this study is to determine whether Bipolar I (BPI) subjects with comorbid externalizing disorders and a subgroup with externalizing symptoms prior to age 15 have different clinical features than those without externalizing disorders and whether these could be attributed to specific genetic variations.	 25823794 12203740 23933821 23453885 22182935 22580979 22573399 21738484 21376301 21383262 20885792 20064125 20201858 20081858 19488044 18711365 18590916 18760714 2232018 17525972 17903298 17701901 17671286 17156154 17032765 17042888 16721402 16443282 9126739 7944874 12183362 3872649 18582182
25775280	Genome-wide association study identifies a new susceptibility locus for cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.	Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without a cleft palate (NSCL/P) is among the most common human congenital birth defects and imposes a substantial physical and financial burden on affected individuals. Here, we conduct a case-control-based GWAS followed by two rounds of replication; we include six independent cohorts from China to elucidate the genetic architecture of NSCL/P in Chinese populations. Using this combined analysis, we identify a new locus at 16p13.3 associated with NSCL/P: rs8049367 between CREBBP and ADCY9 (odds ratio=0.74, P=8.98 × 10(-12)). We confirm that the reported loci at 1q32.2, 10q25.3, 17p13.1 and 20q12 are also involved in NSCL/P development in Chinese populations. Our results provide additional evidence that the rs2235371-related haplotype at 1q32.2 could play a more important role than the previously identified causal variant rs642961 in Chinese populations. These findings provide information on the genetic basis and mechanisms of NSCL/P. 	
25774636	Susceptibility to tuberculosis is associated with variants in the ASAP1 gene encoding a regulator of dendritic cell migration.	Human genetic factors predispose to tuberculosis (TB). We studied 7.6 million genetic variants in 5,530 people with pulmonary TB and in 5,607 healthy controls. In the combined analysis of these subjects and the follow-up cohort (15,087 TB patients and controls altogether), we found an association between TB and variants located in introns of the ASAP1 gene on chromosome 8q24 (P = 2.6 × 10(-11) for rs4733781; P = 1.0 × 10(-10) for rs10956514). Dendritic cells (DCs) showed high ASAP1 expression that was reduced after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and rs10956514 was associated with the level of reduction of ASAP1 expression. The ASAP1 protein is involved in actin and membrane remodeling and has been associated with podosomes. The ASAP1-depleted DCs showed impaired matrix degradation and migration. Therefore, genetically determined excessive reduction of ASAP1 expression in M. tuberculosis-infected DCs may lead to their impaired migration, suggesting a potential mechanism of predisposition to TB.	 15719014 22790178 17149599 22384356 20018961 17675513 21697900 23425167 23128233 24336248 18519696 23104008 22233810 22820512 19345146 18158321 20517342 23981064 23544157 17893324 17868031 16554436 20206579 22306650 22019778 18776909 24057671 15897555 23539302 19543373 20154719 20694014

25778476	A novel Alzheimer disease locus located near the gene encoding tau protein.	APOE ɛ4, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in APOE ɛ4+ (10 352 cases and 9207 controls) and APOE ɛ4- (7184 cases and 26 968 controls) subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE ɛ4 status. Suggestive associations (P<1 × 10(-4)) in stage 1 were evaluated in an independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE ɛ4+: 1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE ɛ4-: 718 cases and 1699 controls). Among APOE ɛ4- subjects, novel genome-wide significant (GWS) association was observed with 17 SNPs (all between KANSL1 and LRRC37A on chromosome 17 near MAPT) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and stage 2 data sets (best SNP, rs2732703, P=5·8 × 10(-9)). Conditional analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the entire 100-kilobase region that includes MAPT. Except for previously identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE ɛ4+ subjects (CR1 and CLU) or APOE ɛ4- subjects (MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E), no other SNPs were significantly associated with AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction of APOE with rs1595014 in TMEM106B (P=1·6 × 10(-7)) is noteworthy, because TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of frontotemporal dementia. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that rs113986870, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is significantly associated with four KANSL1 probes that target transcription of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in hippocampus (P ⩽ 1.3 × 10(-8)), frontal cortex (P ⩽ 1.3 × 10(-9)) and temporal cortex (P⩽1.2 × 10(-11)). Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a MAPT probe that targets transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex (P=9.2 × 10(-6)) and temporal cortex (P=2.6 × 10(-6)). Our APOE-stratified GWAS is the first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the chromosome 17q21.31 region. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD risk in persons lacking APOE ɛ4 compared with persons carrying this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are warranted.	 20186339 21685912 9343467 17602795 21312009 22511793 23064749 22855871 10702411 21898125 22544367 12056929 22556362 19915575 16461860 15792962 22723018 22539343 25306292 22895706 23518664 19165922 10624829 17514749 22751100 19854137 23562540 23226438 23183882 25188341 16000317 22544363 24162737 22751096 21220649 21848658 22869155 21104415 19889475 22504418 17179995 25231068 14872045 19308965 20154673 25324900
25781172	Infection and inflammation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: a genome wide study for interactions with genetic variation.	Inflammation and maternal or fetal infections have been suggested as risk factors for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). It is likely that such environmental effects are contingent on genetic background. Here, in a genome-wide approach, we test the hypothesis that such exposures increase the risk for SZ and BP and that the increase is dependent on genetic variants. We use genome-wide genotype data, plasma IgG antibody measurements against Toxoplasma gondii, Herpes simplex virus type 1, Cytomegalovirus, Human Herpes Virus 6 and the food antigen gliadin as well as measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), a peripheral marker of inflammation. The subjects are SZ cases, BP cases, parents of cases and screened controls. We look for higher levels of our immunity/infection variables and interactions between them and common genetic variation genome-wide. We find many of the antibody measurements higher in both disorders. While individual tests do not withstand correction for multiple comparisons, the number of nominally significant tests and the comparisons showing the expected direction are in significant excess (permutation p=0.019 and 0.004 respectively). We also find CRP levels highly elevated in SZ, BP and the mothers of BP cases, in agreement with existing literature, but possibly confounded by our inability to correct for smoking or body mass index. In our genome-wide interaction analysis no signal reached genome-wide significance, yet many plausible candidate genes emerged. In a hypothesis driven test, we found multiple interactions among SZ-associated SNPs in the HLA region on chromosome 6 and replicated an interaction between CMV infection and genotypes near the CTNNA3 gene reported by a recent GWAS. Our results support that inflammatory processes and infection may modify the risk for psychosis and suggest that the genotype at SZ-associated HLA loci modifies the effect of these variables on the risk to develop SZ. 	 23774138 24139899 23273549 24313887 23974872 23282016 23218564 14991372 24102676 24705297 20691406 25056061 11009087 18268502 11695949 18319743 15319094 9234965 23428789 24565000 12929083 15001816 22075207 24574956 22523482 23453885 21300955 16380905 18156638 22085475 25152454 20837565 22104141 19812666 6409931 20530112 24021055 17701901 10025441 18547475 24277151 23748077 19118813 7565758 23650397 24567502 23358160 9435762 22325983 21621854 14601036 17085743
25786224	Novel genetic locus implicated for HIV-1 acquisition with putative regulatory links to HIV replication and infectivity: a genome-wide association study.	Fifty percent of variability in HIV-1 susceptibility is attributable to host genetics. Thus identifying genetic associations is essential to understanding pathogenesis of HIV-1 and important for targeting drug development. To date, however, CCR5 remains the only gene conclusively associated with HIV acquisition. To identify novel host genetic determinants of HIV-1 acquisition, we conducted a genome-wide association study among a high-risk sample of 3,136 injection drug users (IDUs) from the Urban Health Study (UHS). In addition to being IDUs, HIV-controls were frequency-matched to cases on environmental exposures to enhance detection of genetic effects. We tested independent replication in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (N=2,533). We also examined publicly available gene expression data to link SNPs associated with HIV acquisition to known mechanisms affecting HIV replication/infectivity. Analysis of the UHS nominated eight genetic regions for replication testing. SNP rs4878712 in FRMPD1 met multiple testing correction for independent replication (P=1.38x10(-4)), although the UHS-WIHS meta-analysis p-value did not reach genome-wide significance (P=4.47x10(-7) vs. P<5.0x10(-8)) Gene expression analyses provided promising biological support for the protective G allele at rs4878712 lowering risk of HIV: (1) the G allele was associated with reduced expression of FBXO10 (r=-0.49, P=6.9x10(-5)); (2) FBXO10 is a component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets Bcl-2 protein for degradation; (3) lower FBXO10 expression was associated with higher BCL2 expression (r=-0.49, P=8x10(-5)); (4) higher basal levels of Bcl-2 are known to reduce HIV replication and infectivity in human and animal in vitro studies. These results suggest new potential biological pathways by which host genetics affect susceptibility to HIV upon exposure for follow-up in subsequent studies.	 21160409 22532805 22941192 22384356 23935489 8751444 22915813 22174851 16603238 20976252 21804549 18566450 22125221 20487506 23040885 22064851 20838612 1392708 11773877 9811703 22474614 11313714 16148165 23431138 16077740 20616382 12746244 20126254 22362864 1403641 19696893 20149939 18288889 22511868 22762018 23318951 15901470 21194676 11356437 10469847 18348202 23372042 14997420 23514593 20981092 20702402 21267066 23001569 23138933 20220756
25784220	A PAX1 enhancer locus is associated with susceptibility to idiopathic scoliosis in females.	Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a common paediatric musculoskeletal disease that displays a strong female bias. By performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 3,102 individuals, we identify significant associations with 20p11.22 SNPs for females (P=6.89 × 10(-9)) but not males (P=0.71). This association with IS is also found in independent female cohorts from the United States of America and Japan (overall P=2.15 × 10(-10), OR=1.30 (rs6137473)). Unexpectedly, the 20p11.22 IS risk alleles were previously associated with protection from early-onset alopecia, another sexually dimorphic condition. The 174-kb associated locus is distal to PAX1, which encodes paired box 1, a transcription factor involved in spine development. We identify a sequence in the associated locus with enhancer activity in zebrafish somitic muscle and spinal cord, an activity that is abolished by IS-associated SNPs. We thus identify a sexually dimorphic IS susceptibility locus, and propose the first functionally defined candidate mutations in an enhancer that may regulate expression in specific spinal cells. 	 18171974 25283277 17932119 18849991 18849994 18988837 19073165 19633672 19850031 20395971 20425822 20881960 21058334 21216876 21460842 21613327 22019779 22064851 22265403 22264315 22495965 22693459 22362628 22955616 22992817 23349641 23445094 23666238 24068387 24463529 24721834 10603359 10635522 10742114 10819279 10954107 11315092 11731502 12062030 12062039 12094330 12151879 12384783 12642767 12894991 12951571 8258551 8026324 8896571 15717203 15845037 15906245 16093716 16110506 16207213 16556802 17141012 17414906 17436250 17701901 25182715 18071029

25798622	Identification and validation of N-acetyltransferase 2 as an insulin sensitivity gene.	Decreased insulin sensitivity, also referred to as insulin resistance (IR), is a fundamental abnormality in patients with type 2 diabetes and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While IR predisposition is heritable, the genetic basis remains largely unknown. The GENEticS of Insulin Sensitivity consortium conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for direct measures of insulin sensitivity, such as euglycemic clamp or insulin suppression test, in 2,764 European individuals, with replication in an additional 2,860 individuals. The presence of a nonsynonymous variant of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) [rs1208 (803A>G, K268R)] was strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity that was independent of BMI. The rs1208 "A" allele was nominally associated with IR-related traits, including increased fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary artery disease. NAT2 acetylates arylamine and hydrazine drugs and carcinogens, but predicted acetylator NAT2 phenotypes were not associated with insulin sensitivity. In a murine adipocyte cell line, silencing of NAT2 ortholog Nat1 decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake, increased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, and decreased adipocyte differentiation, while Nat1 overexpression produced opposite effects. Nat1-deficient mice had elevations in fasting blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides and decreased insulin sensitivity, as measured by glucose and insulin tolerance tests, with intermediate effects in Nat1 heterozygote mice. Our results support a role for NAT2 in insulin sensitivity. 	 19861585 20616382 20881960 20935630 20972438 21058334 20858683 21047945 21572414 21886157 21804189 22092036 22193722 22581228 22820512 22885922 22885924 22930813 23202125 23151437 24124113 24699409 24934506 25371518 21510766 10868826 10667461 10973253 11502781 12815173 12815365 12924350 15298351 382871 7014307 6126711 6754206 3056758 2340091 1996083 7988789 9202739 9709945 9794728 13820968 15627487 16862161 17428149 17047637 17434923 17956454 18334921 18642144 18680467 18773084 19261719 19734900 20081858 20185807 20581827 20686565
25799145	Genome-wide association study in an admixed case series reveals IL12A as a new candidate in Behçet disease.	The etiology of Behçet's disease (BD) is unknown, but widely considered an excessive T-cell mediated inflammatory response in a genetically susceptible host. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown limited number of novel loci-associations. The rarity and unequal distribution of the disease prevalence amongst different ethnic backgrounds have hampered the use of GWAS in cohorts of mixed ethnicity and sufficient sample size. However, novel statistical approaches have now enabled GWAS in admixed cohorts.	 1970380 23726366 23041938 16862161 10913059 20438790 22125221 16255080 20622879 24625627 19748964 23001997 20470944 17660222 22748210 18852205 20616382 22699943 10528040 23737753 23291587 22378604 23086283 24151497 11760403 20548291 20622878 17334337 21167468 14685227 25224258 20208533
25811787	Modulation of genetic associations with serum urate levels by body-mass-index in humans.	We tested for interactions between body mass index (BMI) and common genetic variants affecting serum urate levels, genome-wide, in up to 42569 participants. Both stratified genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses, in lean, overweight and obese individuals, and regression-type analyses in a non BMI-stratified overall sample were performed. The former did not uncover any novel locus with a major main effect, but supported modulation of effects for some known and potentially new urate loci. The latter highlighted a SNP at RBFOX3 reaching genome-wide significant level (effect size 0.014, 95% CI 0.008-0.02, Pinter= 2.6 x 10-8). Two top loci in interaction term analyses, RBFOX3 and ERO1LB-EDARADD, also displayed suggestive differences in main effect size between the lean and obese strata. All top ranking loci for urate effect differences between BMI categories were novel and most had small magnitude but opposite direction effects between strata. They include the locus RBMS1-TANK (men, Pdifflean-overweight= 4.7 x 10-8), a region that has been associated with several obesity related traits, and TSPYL5 (men, Pdifflean-overweight= 9.1 x 10-8), regulating adipocytes-produced estradiol. The top-ranking known urate loci was ABCG2, the strongest known gout risk locus, with an effect halved in obese compared to lean men (Pdifflean-obese= 2 x 10-4). Finally, pathway analysis suggested a role for N-glycan biosynthesis as a prominent urate-associated pathway in the lean stratum. These results illustrate a potentially powerful way to monitor changes occurring in obesogenic environment. 	 17944600 21589913 6386716 18487473 22883813 17384015 12824502 19439211 21876681 20356825 19506252 17657863 23284291 24316577 22973544 23192594 1176851 23149655 20303879 15211360 21625475 16880138 23679666 23754948 19503597 18327256 18834626 24706555 22541845 22589738 23263486 23372041 24476385 24012618 22693455 20018089 12591070 20212493 18327257 23703922 19861489 23251661 17924335 21181894 16339923 23205634 21939225 20884846 19001525 21294900 17890445 22581228 23518928 22069379 23552988
25817017	A large-scale genetic analysis reveals a strong contribution of the HLA class II region to giant cell arteritis susceptibility.	We conducted a large-scale genetic analysis on giant cell arteritis (GCA), a polygenic immune-mediated vasculitis. A case-control cohort, comprising 1,651 case subjects with GCA and 15,306 unrelated control subjects from six different countries of European ancestry, was genotyped by the Immunochip array. We also imputed HLA data with a previously validated imputation method to perform a more comprehensive analysis of this genomic region. The strongest association signals were observed in the HLA region, with rs477515 representing the highest peak (p = 4.05 × 10(-40), OR = 1.73). A multivariate model including class II amino acids of HLA-DRβ1 and HLA-DQα1 and one class I amino acid of HLA-B explained most of the HLA association with GCA, consistent with previously reported associations of classical HLA alleles like HLA-DRB1(∗)04. An omnibus test on polymorphic amino acid positions highlighted DRβ1 13 (p = 4.08 × 10(-43)) and HLA-DQα1 47 (p = 4.02 × 10(-46)), 56, and 76 (both p = 1.84 × 10(-45)) as relevant positions for disease susceptibility. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22 (rs2476601, p = 1.73 × 10(-6), OR = 1.38), LRRC32 (rs10160518, p = 4.39 × 10(-6), OR = 1.20), and REL (rs115674477, p = 1.10 × 10(-5), OR = 1.63). Our study provides evidence of a strong contribution of HLA class I and II molecules to susceptibility to GCA. In the non-HLA region, we confirmed a key role for the functional PTPN22 rs2476601 variant and proposed other putative risk loci for GCA involved in Th1, Th17, and Treg cell function. 	 19790127 20457278 20634204 20857242 20981092 21297633 21146972 21615933 21841778 21345260 22036096 22057235 23143596 23381558 23459209 23603761 23603763 23762245 23727859 23749187 22993227 23917628 23834318 23946333 22009320 22286218 22170232 22362761 22143225 22961000 22833233 23084292 22922229 22936693 23143594 23045170 23830517 24189842 23843109 24387989 19349984 24364806 24739678 24821759 25277311 8147928 9704651 9771216 9818656 15573121 16415888 16998491 17057332 17072327 24532677 24390342 11039076 11530315 11602633 12375325 12920695 15264254 15208781 3259885 2202311 1469092 8316295 17311282 17701901 17982049 18628982 18794853 19143809 19200528 19543373 19503088 19666573
25820613	Genome-wide association study of blood lead shows multiple associations near ALAD.	Exposure to high levels of environmental lead, or biomarker evidence of high body lead content, is associated with anaemia, developmental and neurological deficits in children, and increased mortality in adults. Adverse effects of lead still occur despite substantial reduction in environmental exposure. There is genetic variation between individuals in blood lead concentration but the polymorphisms contributing to this have not been defined. We measured blood or erythrocyte lead content, and carried out genome-wide association analysis, on population-based cohorts of adult volunteers from Australia and UK (N = 5433). Samples from Australia were collected in two studies, in 1993-1996 and 2002-2005 and from UK in 1991-1992. One locus, at ALAD on chromosome 9, showed consistent association with blood lead across countries and evidence for multiple independent allelic effects. The most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1805313 (P = 3.91 × 10(-14) for lead concentration in a meta-analysis of all data), is known to have effects on ALAD expression in blood cells but other SNPs affecting ALAD expression did not affect blood lead. Variants at 12 other loci, including ABO, showed suggestive associations (5 × 10(-6) > P > 5 × 10(-8)). Identification of genetic polymorphisms affecting blood lead reinforces the view that genetic factors, as well as environmental ones, are important in determining blood lead levels. The ways in which ALAD variation affects lead uptake or distribution are still to be determined. 	 17431502 11940448 17966070 12540640 12700371 14535579 14746518 15121519 15184277 15236947 7162444 6829562 3327436 1608406 8162884 8028141 8051482 7987149 7601076 8643956 15583371 16809103 16982939 17035139 17366816 17431498 17431501 18462017 17491602 18604267 19543373 19896111 20053595 20598278 20616382 20634204 20517342 21529783 22138821 22507742 22507743 23704328 24039753 24013639 24745988 24940735 12437403 10940968 11049814 10964791 11427399 11764848 11731797 17687451
25823687	Genome-wide association study of myelosuppression in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.	Platinum-induced myelosuppression severely impedes successful chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Hence, it is clinically important to identify the patients who are at high risk for severe toxicity to certain chemotherapy. We first carried out a genome-wide scan of 906 703 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify genetic variants associated with platinum-induced myelosuppression risk in 333 NSCLC patients with chemotherapy. Then, we replicated 24 SNPs that had P<1 × 10(-4) in another independent cohort of 876 NSCLC patients. With P<0.05 as the criterion of statistical significance, we found that rs13014982 at 2q24.3 and rs9909179 at 17p12 exhibited consistently significant associations with myelosuppression risk in both the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) scan and the replication stage (rs13014982: odds ratio (OR)=0.55, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.41-0.74, P=7.29 × 10(-5) for GWAS scan and OR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.93, P=0.006 for replication stage; rs9909179: OR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.37-0.70, P=4.60 × 10(-5) for GWAS scan and OR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99, P=0.040 for replication stage; both in additive model). In combined samples of genome-wide scan and replication samples, the minor alleles of rs13014982 and rs9909179 remained significant associations with the decreased risk of myelosuppression (rs13014982: OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83, P =1.36 × 10(-5); rs9909179: OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.89, P=0.001). Rs13014982 at 2q24.3 and rs9909179 at 17p12 might be independent susceptibility markers for platinum-induced myelosuppression risk in NSCLC patients. 	 11431473 16931765 19458053 19273615 22872573 20393554 19369657 22292074 23648065 24220096 24729390 19715440 21909110 21572416 23620771 22922681 22672901 12358749 15368467 18451988 23715323 11175785 7494563 18375959 20940192 17701901 20231859 9429194 19147868 20943283 12569551
25823570	Identification of myopia-associated WNT7B polymorphisms provides insights into the mechanism underlying the development of myopia.	Myopia can cause severe visual impairment. Here, we report a two-stage genome-wide association study for three myopia-related traits in 9,804 Japanese individuals, which was extended with trans-ethnic replication in 2,674 Chinese and 2,690 Caucasian individuals. We identify WNT7B as a novel susceptibility gene for axial length (rs10453441, Pmeta=3.9 × 10(-13)) and corneal curvature (Pmeta=2.9 × 10(-40)) and confirm the previously reported association between GJD2 and myopia. WNT7B significantly associates with extreme myopia in a case-control study with 1,478 Asian patients and 4,689 controls (odds ratio (OR)meta=1.13, Pmeta=0.011). We also find in a mouse model of myopia downregulation of WNT7B expression in the cornea and upregulation in the retina, suggesting its possible role in the development of myopia. 	 11222670 24144296 23154457 16101943 22792072 22575959 23850287 15791644 17065530 23468642 20835239 18289630 19124844 23821205 23680160 20979653 12450500 23838771 8987830 21665993 12441058 14656288 22685421 23722394 16175559 23734076 20865053 23938127 23933737 17724167 22039230 21095009 22690110 20576483 10412059 18235892 22659691 22665138 20108168 23396134 12815618 17344402 23213273 22564345 23401653 18243904 12185116 19779542 23950155 20074565 20697017 20835236 23953100 21589860 16856174 16249469 21276616 20405027 16014731 20008719 11150340 21640322 16150718 20375751 17197510 1852398 15056712 11438934 18296925 19632261
25826619	Common variation at 1q24.1 (ALDH9A1) is a potential risk factor for renal cancer.	So far six susceptibility loci for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To identify additional RCC common risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of published GWAS (totalling 2,215 cases and 8,566 controls of Western-European background) with imputation using 1000 Genomes Project and UK10K Project data as reference panels and followed up the most significant association signals [22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 indels in eight genomic regions] in 383 cases and 2,189 controls from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A combined analysis identified a promising susceptibility locus mapping to 1q24.1 marked by the imputed SNP rs3845536 (Pcombined =2.30x10-8). Specifically, the signal maps to intron 4 of the ALDH9A1 gene (aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family, member A1). We further evaluated this potential signal in 2,461 cases and 5,081 controls from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GWAS of RCC cases and controls from multiple European regions. In contrast to earlier findings no association was shown in the IARC series (P=0.94; Pcombined =2.73x10-5). While variation at 1q24.1 represents a potential risk locus for RCC, future replication analyses are required to substantiate our observation. 	 11154732 8944229 24220699 23996088 23792563 23184150 23128226 22707636 22634755 22113997 22010048 22120009 21804547 21531791 21351269 21131975 20448658 19654303 19615732 19164279 19402075 9417993 12029063 7932824 25208325
25751624	Fine mapping of type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci and evidence for colocalization of causal variants with lymphoid gene enhancers.	Genetic studies of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have identified 50 susceptibility regions, finding major pathways contributing to risk, with some loci shared across immune disorders. To make genetic comparisons across autoimmune disorders as informative as possible, a dense genotyping array, the Immunochip, was developed, from which we identified four new T1D-associated regions (P < 5 × 10(-8)). A comparative analysis with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases, significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34(+) stem cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in these cell types to identify which particular genes and regulatory sequences are causal. 	 24413736 24413732 24670763 24830394 25122612 14578255 15220214 6363172 15674389 16155052 16862161 17554300 17554260 17701901 19073967 19136655 18642345 19701192 19732865 20562413 20603248 20616382 19430480 20827270 20976797 20981092 20926424 21297633 21852963 21962506 21980299 22057235 22064851 21989056 22511882 22446964 22961000 22751096 22522618 23128233 23143596 23104008 24013639 24316577 24604202

25751625	Genome-wide association analysis of more than 120,000 individuals identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for breast cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large-scale replication studies have identified common variants in 79 loci associated with breast cancer, explaining ∼14% of the familial risk of the disease. To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 GWAS, comprising 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS). Analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry. We generated genotypes for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, and we identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer at P < 5 × 10(-8). Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, we identified likely target genes in two regions: SETBP1 at 18q12.3 and RNF115 and PDZK1 at 1q21.1. One association appears to be driven by an amino acid substitution encoded in EXO1. 	 22820512 11967536 17293864 17529973 17529974 17529967 18391951 18438407 19219042 19330027 19330030 20453838 20583289 20616382 20852631 21263130 20517342 22037553 22267197 22383897 22331459 23000897 22976474 23535729 23535731 23535733 23821363 24119843 24196873 24487276 24493630 25038754 24943594 25168388 25581431 24027428 16682732 15122511

25849990	Genetic variation at MECOM, TERT, JAK2 and HBS1L-MYB predisposes to myeloproliferative neoplasms.	Clonal proliferation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is driven by somatic mutations in JAK2, CALR or MPL, but the contribution of inherited factors is poorly characterized. Using a three-stage genome-wide association study of 3,437 MPN cases and 10,083 controls, we identify two SNPs with genome-wide significance in JAK2(V617F)-negative MPN: rs12339666 (JAK2; meta-analysis P=1.27 × 10(-10)) and rs2201862 (MECOM; meta-analysis P=1.96 × 10(-9)). Two additional SNPs, rs2736100 (TERT) and rs9376092 (HBS1L/MYB), achieve genome-wide significance when including JAK2(V617F)-positive cases. rs9376092 has a stronger effect in JAK2(V617F)-negative cases with CALR and/or MPL mutations (Breslow-Day P=4.5 × 10(-7)), whereas in JAK2(V617F)-positive cases rs9376092 associates with essential thrombocythemia (ET) rather than polycythemia vera (allelic χ(2) P=7.3 × 10(-7)). Reduced MYB expression, previously linked to development of an ET-like disease in model systems, associates with rs9376092 in normal myeloid cells. These findings demonstrate that multiple germline variants predispose to MPN and link constitutional differences in MYB expression to disease phenotype. 	 24476768 24325356 21241896 21385855 21531982 21738486 21537334 21757629 22139419 22064851 22157820 11129752 11922610 12111920 12239137 11328886 12499305 12941699 14633662 1370341 8547101 8528252 9872408 15297300 16000354 16032513 16352805 16537803 17183644 17592125 17701901 17921354 17712044 17998545 18181200 18539114 18451307 18796136 19287382 19287385 19228925 19360001 19528534 19440215 19820697 19862010 19853236 20331456 20304805 20634204 20702402 20944595 21074499 22307276 22423221 22366785 22955989 22955616 22898600 22879541 23143109 23570689 24149102 24325359 24316577 24703711
25855136	New basal cell carcinoma susceptibility loci.	In an ongoing screen for DNA sequence variants that confer risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC), we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 24,988,228 SNPs and small indels detected through whole-genome sequencing of 2,636 Icelanders and imputed into 4,572 BCC patients and 266,358 controls. Here we show the discovery of four new BCC susceptibility loci: 2p24 MYCN (rs57244888[C], OR=0.76, P=4.7 × 10(-12)), 2q33 CASP8-ALS2CR12 (rs13014235[C], OR=1.15, P=1.5 × 10(-9)), 8q21 ZFHX4 (rs28727938[G], OR=0.70, P=3.5 × 10(-12)) and 10p14 GATA3 (rs73635312[A], OR=0.74, P=2.4 × 10(-16)). Fine mapping reveals that two variants correlated with rs73635312[A] occur in conserved binding sites for the GATA3 transcription factor. In addition, expression microarrays and RNA-seq show that rs13014235[C] and a related SNP rs700635[C] are associated with expression of CASP8 splice variants in which sequences from intron 8 are retained. 	 18305469 17116754 23770605 21270109 17786808 25168388 21526222 11179997 19165921 9931336 11735112 22974093 23792051 19533801 18813320 19204729 12923059 23482648 22064851 18849993 18344981 24587976 9644970 22690667 21368762 12048196 22955616 21983787 19578363 19720838 17151017 11254446 21704196 19478016 15735742 17450141 21402173 8681377 24186490 9341131 23715323 8681376 24403052 21152010 19151717 24267888 10661403 24464100 24487276 18488027 19384953 12010812 18285427 10860845 22383036 21611195 21946351 17293864 12010809 21441907 21152126 15601643 20601102 20016592 19798694 11973654 22955990 24086065
25865494	Genome-wide Analysis of Body Proportion Classifies Height-Associated Variants by Mechanism of Action and Implicates Genes Important for Skeletal Development.	Human height is a composite measurement, reflecting the sum of leg, spine, and head lengths. Many common variants influence total height, but the effects of these or other variants on the components of height (body proportion) remain largely unknown. We studied sitting height ratio (SHR), the ratio of sitting height to total height, to identify such effects in 3,545 African Americans and 21,590 individuals of European ancestry. We found that SHR is heritable: 26% and 39% of the total variance of SHR can be explained by common variants in European and African Americans, respectively, and global European admixture is negatively correlated with SHR in African Americans (r(2) ≈ 0.03). Six regions reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) for association with SHR and overlapped biological candidate genes, including TBX2 and IGFBP3. We found that 130 of 670 height-associated variants are nominally associated (p < 0.05) with SHR, more than expected by chance (p = 5 × 10(-40)). At these 130 loci, the height-increasing alleles are associated with either a decrease (71 loci) or increase (59 loci) in SHR, suggesting that different height loci disproportionally affect either leg length or spine/head length. Pathway analyses via DEPICT revealed that height loci affecting SHR, and especially those affecting leg length, show enrichment of different biological pathways (e.g., bone/cartilage/growth plate pathways) than do loci with no effect on SHR (e.g., embryonic development). These results highlight the value of using a pair of related but orthogonal phenotypes, in this case SHR with height, as a prism to dissect the biology underlying genetic associations in polygenic traits and diseases.	 15459098 21067998 3338305 2646917 10802651 11297622 12023302 12189439 12235108 12540691 8061761 7634452 9486752 10086939 15863466 16255080 16707651 16862161 17344885 17572673 17255346 17701901 17566087 18776909 21167468 22080510 22426310 22820512 23128226 23269371 22507742 23756893 23912288 24285300 24670763 25108383 25282103 25529636 25597830 25281659 25581432 25640676 25673412 3591674 19407144 20206336 20556869 20562875 20617018 20635360 20616382 20881960 20959295 25673413

25869804	GWAS for executive function and processing speed suggests involvement of the CADM2 gene.	To identify common variants contributing to normal variation in two specific domains of cognitive functioning, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of executive functioning and information processing speed in non-demented older adults from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium. Neuropsychological testing was available for 5429-32,070 subjects of European ancestry aged 45 years or older, free of dementia and clinical stroke at the time of cognitive testing from 20 cohorts in the discovery phase. We analyzed performance on the Trail Making Test parts A and B, the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), semantic and phonemic fluency tests, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 × 10(-8)) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 × 10(-9) after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 × 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 × 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 × 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 × 10(-13)). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed.	 21460841 10592173 22302529 23251316 16965182 8759042 24243840 9715357 20031568 23830668 17943122 12235304 16698126 17474819 19413434 21996756 18615557 20125193 19734545 18628350 21130836 11665325 19672843 20145623 21130223 23493587 17564960 20935630 19768548 23586942 19285755 24944428 22126837 21617952 20383146 21460840 23715323 20152859 11752295 10073923 22832960 16721405 23193258 18599010 21167468 17903297 16341908 10802651 22700061
25888059	The obesity-risk variant of FTO is inversely related with the So-Eum constitutional type: genome-wide association and replication analyses.	Body constitutional types described in the traditional Korean medicine system, Sasang constitutional medicine, are heritable, as has been revealed by twin and family studies. Thus, individuals with the same constitution type usually have similar pathophysiological and psychological traits. In several recent genome-wide association (GWA) analyses performed to identify constitution-associated variants, the association signals were not replicated due to small sample size and dissimilar, non-objective methods for classification of the constitutional types.	 23300848 19073975 17496892 19552595 22889232 22002720 19380352 22454673 23505390 3802833 17434869 19745018 21379325 17572673 18842783 23155456 22311015 16341070 18782426 22394158 22109280 15297300 19745008 19745011 19954339 16302022 21146241 21679732 22567034 23977173 20634204 21860654 17701901 22705421 21167468 23548105 22762505 19396169 23554836 21958429 18663371 22889377 14499028 19745007
25877299	Two new loci and gene sets related to sex determination and cancer progression are associated with susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumor.	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have reported 19 distinct susceptibility loci for testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). A GWA study for TGCT was performed by genotyping 610 240 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1326 cases and 6687 controls from Sweden and Norway. No novel genome-wide significant associations were observed in this discovery stage. We put forward 27 SNPs from 15 novel regions and 12 SNPs previously reported, for replication in 710 case-parent triads and 289 cases and 290 controls. Predefined biological pathways and processes, in addition to a custom-built sex-determination gene set, were subject to enrichment analyses using Meta-Analysis Gene Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (M) and Improved Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for Genome-wide Association Study (I). In the combined meta-analysis, we observed genome-wide significant association for rs7501939 on chromosome 17q12 (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72-0.84, P = 1.1 × 10(-9)) and rs2195987 on chromosome 19p12 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69-0.84, P = 3.2 × 10(-8)). The marker rs7501939 on chromosome 17q12 is located in an intron of the HNF1B gene, encoding a member of the homeodomain-containing superfamily of transcription factors. The sex-determination gene set (false discovery rate, FDRM < 0.001, FDRI < 0.001) and pathways related to NF-κB, glycerophospholipid and ether lipid metabolism, as well as cancer and apoptosis, was associated with TGCT (FDR < 0.1). In addition to revealing two new TGCT susceptibility loci, our results continue to support the notion that genes governing normal germ cell development in utero are implicated in the development of TGCT.

There is an established sex-difference in carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), a recognized marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. However, the genetic underpinnings of sex-differences in gene-IMT associations are largely unknown.	 23583978 24327950 16862161 20372150 10707916 15528886 23487405 9878640 19250944 11486097 24202307 22972311 17108679 23704105 11867360 12417297 22619283 12574549 19498180 11988625 20540798 23575227 21906922 24739292 21701570 18787196 22073261 22462751 24954085 17701901 24446411 21558551 15331789 22423143 12105369
25886283	Genome-wide association study of serum minerals levels in children of different ethnic background.	Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride and phosphorus are the major dietary minerals involved in various biological functions and are commonly measured in the blood serum. Sufficient mineral intake is especially important for children due to their rapid growth. Currently, the genetic mechanisms influencing serum mineral levels are poorly understood, especially for children. We carried out a genome-wide association (GWA) study on 5,602 European-American children and 4,706 African-American children who had mineral measures available in their electronic medical records (EMR). While no locus met the criteria for genome-wide significant association, our results demonstrated a nominal association of total serum calcium levels with a missense variant in the calcium -sensing receptor (CASR) gene on 3q13 (rs1801725, P = 1.96 × 10(-3)) in the African-American pediatric cohort, a locus previously reported in Caucasians. We also confirmed the association result in our pediatric European-American cohort (P = 1.38 × 10(-4)). We further replicated two other loci associated with serum calcium levels in the European-American cohort (rs780094, GCKR, P = 4.26 × 10(-3); rs10491003, GATA3, P = 0.02). In addition, we replicated a previously reported locus on 1q21, demonstrating association of serum magnesium levels with MUC1 (rs4072037, P = 2.04 × 10(-6)). Moreover, in an extended gene-based association analysis we uncovered evidence for association of calcium levels with the previously reported gene locus DGKD in both European-American children and African-American children. Taken together, our results support a role for CASR and DGKD mediated calcium regulation in both African-American and European-American children, and corroborate the association of calcium levels with GCKR and GATA3, and the association of magnesium levels with MUC1 in the European-American children.	 11004227 23731539 6541017 1317758 16862161 17117288 17576678 17701901 18823568 20598278 20661308 20700443 20705733 23263863 23603706 24068962 12193151

25897833	Genome-wide association study of behavioural and psychiatric features in human prion disease.	Prion diseases are rare neurodegenerative conditions causing highly variable clinical syndromes, which often include prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms. We have recently carried out a clinical study of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms in a large prospective cohort of patients with prion disease in the United Kingdom, allowing us to operationalise specific behavioural/psychiatric phenotypes as traits in human prion disease. Here, we report exploratory genome-wide association analysis on 170 of these patients and 5200 UK controls, looking for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with three behavioural/psychiatric phenotypes in the context of prion disease. We also specifically examined a selection of candidate SNPs that have shown genome-wide association with psychiatric conditions in previously published studies, and the codon 129 polymorphism of the prion protein gene, which is known to modify various aspects of the phenotype of prion disease. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance, and there was no evidence of altered burden of known psychiatric risk alleles in relevant prion cases. SNPs showing suggestive evidence of association (P<10(-5)) included several lying near genes previously implicated in association studies of other psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. These include ANK3, SORL1 and a region of chromosome 6p containing several genes implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We would encourage others to acquire phenotype data in independent cohorts of patients with prion disease as well as other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions, to allow meta-analysis that may shed clearer light on the biological basis of these complex disease manifestations, and the diseases themselves. 	 11283320 14522862 14740295 15361416 9314868 10443888 16387988 17912248 18083066 18711365 19278902 19571808 19571811 19773352 20081856 19107115 20517937 21037240 21353194 22013183 22210626 22005930 23550114 23453885 23933821 23164818 24585329
25897834	The International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC): a genome-wide association study of antidepressant treatment response.	Response to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) varies considerably between patients. The International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC) was formed with the primary goal of identifying genetic variation that may contribute to response to SSRI treatment of major depressive disorder. A genome-wide association study of 4-week treatment outcomes, measured using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17), was performed using data from 865 subjects from seven sites. The primary outcomes were percent change in HRSD-17 score and response, defined as at least 50% reduction in HRSD-17. Data from two prior studies, the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomics Study (PGRN-AMPS) and the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, were used for replication, and a meta-analysis of the three studies was performed (N=2394). Although many top association signals in the ISPC analysis map to interesting candidate genes, none were significant at the genome-wide level and the associations were not replicated using PGRN-AMPS and STAR*D data. The top association result in the meta-analysis of response represents SNPs 5′ upstream of the neuregulin-1 gene, NRG1 (P = 1.20E - 06). NRG1 is involved in many aspects of brain development, including neuronal maturation and variations in this gene have been shown to be associated with increased risk for mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Replication and functional studies of these findings are warranted.	 23228238 23933821 10835412 24975899 22147842 23091423 16687441 18466881 21959789 20010717 10595520 8617786 24507884 22177545 20471034 22028923 18181227 21282625 23377640 23632455 19846067 21947081 22175526 19200528 24743713 22030708 23852853 18762592 19793310 9683597 19254516 25050139 23237317 18348195 22907730 19736353 12145742 15128384 20360315 17701901 12778843 21399569 21167468 24633675 22445761 21115088 19717643 23553203
25855579	Thyroid cancer GWAS identifies 10q26.12 and 6q14.1 as novel susceptibility loci and reveals genetic heterogeneity among populations.	Thyroid cancer is the most heritable cancer of all those not displaying typical Mendelian inheritance. However, most of the genetic factors that would explain the high heritability remain unknown. Our aim was to identify additional common genetic variants associated with susceptibility to this disease. In order to do so, we performed a genome-wide association study in a series of 398 cases and 502 controls from Spain, followed by a replication in four well-defined Southern European case-control collections contributing a total of 1,422 cases and 1,908 controls. The association between the variation at the 9q22 locus near FOXE1 and thyroid cancer risk was consistent across all series, with several SNPs identified (rs7028661: OR = 1.64, p = 1.0 × 10(-22) , rs7037324: OR = 1.54, p = 1.2 × 10(-17) ). Moreover, the rare alleles of three SNPs (rs2997312, rs10788123 and rs1254167) at 10q26.12 showed suggestive evidence of association with higher risk of the disease (OR = 1.35, p = 1.2 × 10(-04) , OR = 1.26, p = 5.2 × 10(-04) and OR = 1.38, p = 5.9 × 10(-05) , respectively). Finally, the rare allele of rs4075570 at 6q14.1 conferred protection in the series studied (OR = 0.82, p = 2.0 × 10(-04) ). This study suggests that heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility between populations is a key feature to take into account when exploring genetic risk factors related to this disease. 	
25898920	Genomics and metabolomics of muscular mass in a community-based sample of UK females.	The contribution of specific molecular-genetic factors to muscle mass variation and sarcopenia remains largely unknown. To identify endogenous molecules and specific genetic factors associated with appendicular lean mass (APLM) in the general population, cross-sectional data from the TwinsUK Adult Twin Registry were used. Non-targeted mass spec-based metabolomic profiling was performed on plasma of 3953 females (mostly dizygotic and monozygotic twins). APLM was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and genotyping was genome-wide (GWAS). Specific metabolites were used as intermediate phenotypes in the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with APLM using GWAS. In all, 162 metabolites were found significantly correlated with APLM, and explained 17.4% of its variation. However, the top three of them (unidentified substance X12063, urate, and mannose) explained 11.1% (P ≤ 9.25 × 10(-26)) so each was subjected to GWAS. Each metabolite showed highly significant (P ≤ 9.28 × 10(-46)) associations with genetic variants in the corresponding genomic regions. Mendelian randomization using these SNPs found no evidence for a direct causal effect of these metabolites on APLM. However, using a new software platform for bivariate analysis we showed that shared genetic factors contribute significantly (P ≤ 4.31 × 10(-43)) to variance in both the metabolites and APLM--independent of the effect of the associated SNPs. There are several metabolites, having a clear pattern of genetic inheritance, which are highly significantly associated with APLM and may provide a cheap and readily accessible biomarker of muscle mass. However, the mechanism by which the genetic factor influences muscle mass remains to be discovered.	 18487473 17384015 17550956 21289278 24626161 25339901 14769646 16124998 21468518 20392703 21823675 23894584 24535998 22509378 23088889 9421240 18585721 23272036 15956674 3953676 21886157 18511760 20519697 24159078 9322800 24816252 23263486 19692116 15800289 23942138 22048656 18726182 20439422 20616999 23108985 12970377 24975926 16429159 22817777 22589082 22505343 21303541 22087292 18221845 21572082
25903422	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies multiple novel associations and ethnic heterogeneity of psoriasis susceptibility.	Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with complex genetics and different degrees of prevalence across ethnic populations. Here we present the largest trans-ethnic genome-wide meta-analysis (GWMA) of psoriasis in 15,369 cases and 19,517 controls of Caucasian and Chinese ancestries. We identify four novel associations at LOC144817, COG6, RUNX1 and TP63, as well as three novel secondary associations within IFIH1 and IL12B. Fine-mapping analysis of MHC region demonstrates an important role for all three HLA class I genes and a complex and heterogeneous pattern of HLA associations between Caucasian and Chinese populations. Further, trans-ethnic comparison suggests population-specific effect or allelic heterogeneity for 11 loci. These population-specific effects contribute significantly to the ethnic diversity of psoriasis prevalence. This study not only provides novel biological insights into the involvement of immune and keratinocyte development mechanism, but also demonstrates a complex and heterogeneous genetic architecture of psoriasis susceptibility across ethnic populations. 	 20871597 14608357 20953187 20953188 20953189 20953190 20972438 21051598 21091910 14702039 9928486 15627076 16862161 16998491 17943122 18047519 18369459 19131956 19169253 19169254 19169255 19641206 20034760 21807881 22274697 22286218 22446964 22076464 22673192 22797724 22820512 22910173 23128233 23143594 23104006 23150456 23535730 23555291 23563608 23785302 23791106 23770605 23793025 23817571 23974872 24258200 24479639 24390345 24390342 25056061 25087609 24013639 23921949 24415949 12390189 20953186
25918132	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Loci Associated With Diisocyanate-Induced Occupational Asthma.	Diisocyanates, reactive chemicals used to produce polyurethane products, are the most common causes of occupational asthma. The aim of this study is to identify susceptibility gene variants that could contribute to the pathogenesis of diisocyanate asthma (DA) using a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed in 74 diisocyanate-exposed workers with DA and 824 healthy controls using Omni-2.5 and Omni-5 SNP microarrays. We identified 11 SNPs that exceeded genome-wide significance; the strongest association was for the rs12913832 SNP located on chromosome 15, which has been mapped to the HERC2 gene (p = 6.94 × 10(-14)). Strong associations were also found for SNPs near the ODZ3 and CDH17 genes on chromosomes 4 and 8 (rs908084, p = 8.59 × 10(-9) and rs2514805, p = 1.22 × 10(-8), respectively). We also prioritized 38 SNPs with suggestive genome-wide significance (p < 1 × 10(-6)). Among them, 17 SNPs map to the PITPNC1, ACMSD, ZBTB16, ODZ3, and CDH17 gene loci. Functional genomics data indicate that 2 of the suggestive SNPs (rs2446823 and rs2446824) are located within putative binding sites for the CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP) and Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4, Alpha transcription factors (TFs), respectively. This study identified SNPs mapping to the HERC2, CDH17, and ODZ3 genes as potential susceptibility loci for DA. Pathway analysis indicated that these genes are associated with antigen processing and presentation, and other immune pathways. Overlap of 2 suggestive SNPs with likely TF binding sites suggests possible roles in disruption of gene regulation. These results provide new insights into the genetic architecture of DA and serve as a basis for future functional and mechanistic studies.	 8982516 19474294 23703215 22234890 24709764 19576566 17208590 24664350 21489615 11929482 2179676 23175613 20944595 22610343 22086951 20023648 18498542 18438405 10351934 21325943 21775519 19191163 22955616 22715349 19187332 20642200 11037894 17041011 9655739 23829686 22977168 20378774 20597903 25215497 21912604 21907864 20576703 11811926 16925947 17201240 22955828 21573916 19581591 18308695 12952275
25936594	Genome wide identification of new genes and pathways in patients with both autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes.	Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D) frequently occur in the same individual pointing to a strong shared genetic susceptibility. Indeed, the co-occurrence of T1D and AITD in the same individual is classified as a variant of the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 (designated APS3v). Our aim was to identify new genes and mechanisms causing the co-occurrence of T1D + AITD (APS3v) in the same individual using a genome-wide approach. For our discovery set we analyzed 346 Caucasian APS3v patients and 727 gender and ethnicity matched healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human660W-Quad.v1. The replication set included 185 APS3v patients and 340 controls. Association analyses were performed using the PLINK program, and pathway analyses were performed using the MAGENTA software. We identified multiple signals within the HLA region and conditioning studies suggested that a few of them contributed independently to the strong association of the HLA locus with APS3v. Outside the HLA region, variants in GPR103, a gene not suggested by previous studies of APS3v, T1D, or AITD, showed genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)). In addition, a locus on 1p13 containing the PTPN22 gene showed genome-wide significant associations. Pathway analysis demonstrated that cell cycle, B-cell development, CD40, and CTLA-4 signaling were the major pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of APS3v. These findings suggest that complex mechanisms involving T-cell and B-cell pathways are involved in the strong genetic association between AITD and T1D.	 21399635 22005987 22888137 24041677 24622796 10601992 25329145 12145233 17334650 17558408 17729039 18776148 18683858 19141582 19578366 20453842 20578896 19430480 20837527 21297633 11911825 25414389 12734793 12714592 15049939 15141045 15219384 7035635 2387197 8157715 7829823 8577709 9203460 9504111 9589653 9707586 15297300 15719322 15928253 16503115
25802187	Genetic variants in five novel loci including CFB and CD40 predispose to chronic hepatitis B.	Hepatitis B virus affects more than 2 billion people worldwide, 350 million of which have developed chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The genetic factors that confer CHB risk are still largely unknown. We sought to identify genetic variants for CHB susceptibility in the Chinese population. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2,514 CHB cases and 1,130 normal controls from eastern China. We replicated 33 of the most promising signals and eight previously reported CHB risk loci through a two-stage validation totaling 6,600 CHB cases and 8,127 controls in four independent populations, of which two populations were recruited from eastern China, one from northern China and one from southern China. The joint analyses of 9,114 CHB cases and 9,257 controls revealed significant association of CHB risk with five novel loci. Four loci are located in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21.3, including two nonsynonymous variants (rs12614 [R32W] in complement factor B [CFB], Pmeta =1.28 × 10(-34) ; and rs422951 [T320A] in NOTCH4, Pmeta  = 5.33 × 10(-16) ); one synonymous variant (rs378352 in HLA-DOA corresponding to HLA-DOA*010101, Pmeta  = 1.04 × 10(-23) ); and one noncoding variant (rs2853953 near HLA-C, Pmeta  = 5.06 × 10(-20) ). Another locus is located at 20q13.1 (rs1883832 in the Kozak sequence of CD40, Pmeta  = 2.95 × 10(-15) ). Additionally, we validated seven of eight previously reported CHB susceptibility loci (rs3130542 at HLA-C, rs1419881 at TCF19, rs652888 at EHMT2, rs2856718 at HLA-DQB1, rs7453920 at HLA-DQB2, rs3077 at HLA-DPA1, and rs9277535 at HLA-DPA2, which are all located in the HLA region, 9.84 × 10(-71)  ≤ Pmeta  ≤ 9.92 × 10(-7) ).	
25918841	A genome wide association study links glutamate receptor pathway to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease risk.	We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study in 434 sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) patients and 1939 controls from the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands. The findings were replicated in an independent sample of 1109 sCJD and 2264 controls provided by a multinational consortium. From the initial GWA analysis we selected 23 SNPs for further genotyping in 1109 sCJD cases from seven different countries. Five SNPs were significantly associated with sCJD after correction for multiple testing. Subsequently these five SNPs were genotyped in 2264 controls. The pooled analysis, including 1543 sCJD cases and 4203 controls, yielded two genome wide significant results: rs6107516 (p-value=7.62x10-9) a variant tagging the prion protein gene (PRNP); and rs6951643 (p-value=1.66x10-8) tagging the Glutamate Receptor Metabotropic 8 gene (GRM8). Next we analysed the data stratifying by country of origin combining samples from the pooled analysis with genotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and imputed genotypes from the Rotterdam Study (Total n=12967). The meta-analysis of the results showed that rs6107516 (p-value=3.00x10-8) and rs6951643 (p-value=3.91x10-5) remained as the two most significantly associated SNPs. Rs6951643 is located in an intronic region of GRM8, a gene that was additionally tagged by a cluster of 12 SNPs within our top100 ranked results. GRM8 encodes for mGluR8, a protein which belongs to the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, recently shown to be involved in the transduction of cellular signals triggered by the prion protein. Pathway enrichment analyses performed with both Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and ALIGATOR postulates glutamate receptor signalling as one of the main pathways associated with sCJD. In summary, we have detected GRM8 as a novel, non-PRNP, genome-wide significant marker associated with heightened disease risk, providing additional evidence supporting a role of glutamate receptors in sCJD pathogenesis. 	 20035629 9844549 22210626 22137330 23128226 23195314 23715323 23518043 10335789 15297300 17384015 17554300 17893677 19417063 19539887 20876210 19458495 9333239 7901042 8100741 12114529 20616382 24258680 23651058 24012003

25676789	Genome-wide association study identifies ABCG2 (BCRP) as an allopurinol transporter and a determinant of drug response.	The first-line treatment of hyperuricemia, which causes gout, is allopurinol. The allopurinol response is highly variable, with many users failing to achieve target serum uric acid (SUA) levels. No genome-wide association study (GWAS) has examined the genetic factors affecting allopurinol effectiveness. Using 2,027 subjects in Kaiser Permanente's Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) Cohort, we conducted a GWAS of allopurinol-related SUA reduction, first in the largest ethnic group, non-Hispanic white (NHW) subjects, and then in a stratified transethnic meta-analysis. ABCG2, encoding the efflux pump BCRP, was associated with SUA reduction in NHW subjects (P = 2 × 10(-8) ), and a missense allele (rs2231142) was associated with a reduced response (P = 3 × 10(-7) ) in the meta-analysis. Isotopic uptake studies in cells demonstrated that BCRP transports allopurinol and genetic variants in ABCG2 affect this transport. Collectively, this first GWAS of allopurinol response demonstrates that ABCG2 is a key determinant of response to the drug. 	 15838659 17194218 22384356 23128226 17638908 21912425 23024028 23493553 23315156 22138821 20370912 20566650 24431399 22820512 22575704 18701466 12024214 24461111 20517342 18364470 22647630 15955871 15001581 15743917 23263486 16135657 17701901 21801394 22797727 21565264 16259759 19543373 17483351 21903159 21205285
25934476	Genetic variants in the ADAMTS13 and SUPT3H genes are associated with ADAMTS13 activity.	A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) cleaves von Willebrand factor, reducing its prothrombotic activity. The genetic determinants of ADAMTS13 activity remain unclear. We performed a genome-wide association study of ADAMTS13 activity in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. We used imputed genotypes of common variants in a discovery sample of 3443 individuals and replication sample of 2025 individuals. We examined rare exonic variant associations in ADAMTS13 in 1609 individuals using an exome array. rs41314453 in ADAMTS13 was associated with ADAMTS13 activity in both our discovery (β, -20.2%; P = 1.3 × 10(-33)) and replication sample (P = 3.3 × 10(-34)), and explained 3.6% to 6.5% of the variance. In the combined analysis of our discovery and replication samples, there were 2 further independent associations at the ADAMTS13 locus: rs3118667 (β, 3.0; P = 9.6 × 10(-21)) and rs139911703 (β, -11.6; P = 3.6 × 10(-8)). In addition, rs10456544 in SUPT3H was associated with a 4.2 increase in ADAMTS13 activity (P = 1.13.6 × 10(-8)). Finally, we found 3 independent associations with rare coding variants in ADAMTS13: rs148312697 (β, -32.2%; P = 3.7 × 10(-6)), rs142572218 (β, -46.0%; P = 3.9 × 10(-5)), and rs36222275 (β, -13.9%; P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). In conclusion, we identified rs41314453 as the main genetic determinant of ADAMTS13 activity, and we present preliminary findings for further associations at the ADAMTS13 and SUPT3H loci. 	
25935875	Effect of genetic variations on ticagrelor plasma levels and clinical outcomes.	Ticagrelor, a direct-acting P2Y12-receptor antagonist, is rapidly absorbed and partly metabolized to the major metabolite AR-C124910XX (ARC). To identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and clinical outcomes, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in patients treated with ticagrelor in the PLATO trial.	
25827949	Genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for cutaneous lupus erythematosus.	Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the skin with typical clinical manifestations. Here, we genotyped 906 600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 183 CLE cases and 1288 controls of Central European ancestry. Replication was performed for 13 SNPs in 219 case subjects and 262 controls from Finland. Association was particularly pronounced at 4 loci, all with genomewide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8) ): rs2187668 (PGWAS  = 1.4 × 10(-12) ), rs9267531 (PGWAS  = 4.7 × 10(-10) ), rs4410767 (PGWAS  = 1.0 × 10(-9) ) and rs3094084 (PGWAS  = 1.1 × 10(-9) ). All mentioned SNPs are located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region of chromosome 6 and near genes of known immune functions or associations with other autoimmune diseases such as HLA-DQ alpha chain 1 (HLA-DQA1), MICA, MICB, MSH5, TRIM39 and RPP21. For example, TRIM39/RPP21 read through transcript is a known mediator of the interferon response, a central pathway involved in the pathogenesis of CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Taken together, this genomewide analysis of disease association of CLE identified candidate genes and genomic regions that may contribute to pathogenic mechanisms in CLE via dysregulated antigen presentation (HLA-DQA1), apoptosis regulation, RNA processing and interferon response (MICA, MICB, MSH5, TRIM39 and RPP21). 	
25939698	Enhanced meta-analysis and replication studies identify five new psoriasis susceptibility loci.	Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease with complex genetic architecture. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a recent meta-analysis using Immunochip data have uncovered 36 susceptibility loci. Here, we extend our previous meta-analysis of European ancestry by refined genotype calling and imputation and by the addition of 5,033 cases and 5,707 controls. The combined analysis, consisting of over 15,000 cases and 27,000 controls, identifies five new psoriasis susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)). The newly identified signals include two that reside in intergenic regions (1q31.1 and 5p13.1) and three residing near PLCL2 (3p24.3), NFKBIZ (3q12.3) and CAMK2G (10q22.2). We further demonstrate that NFKBIZ is a TRAF3IP2-dependent target of IL-17 signalling in human skin keratinocytes, thereby functionally linking two strong candidate genes. These results further integrate the genetics and immunology of psoriasis, suggesting new avenues for functional analysis and improved therapies. 	 25006012 24097068 21874034 21297633 8120416 20953186 24338674 23128226 24655295 22500001 22673731 24852054 20953189 24070858 19169254 23128233 19169255 20953187 24316577 22138821 20383124 22581863 21335551 20953188 24212883 22820512 22955616 15241416 11356851 20616382 17277779 24390342 22955987 20953190 22992523 22328738 22936669 22269347 18369457 10612823 20634204 21399635 17035243 24441097 23817569 21833088 19825828 20428186 22955828 22914738 20601685 23345460 25145755 10693762 23143594 20208533
25939597	Two susceptibility loci identified for prostate cancer aggressiveness.	Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will experience indolent disease; hence, discovering genetic variants that distinguish aggressive from nonaggressive prostate cancer is of critical clinical importance for disease prevention and treatment. In a multistage, case-only genome-wide association study of 12,518 prostate cancer cases, we identify two loci associated with Gleason score, a pathological measure of disease aggressiveness: rs35148638 at 5q14.3 (RASA1, P=6.49 × 10(-9)) and rs78943174 at 3q26.31 (NAALADL2, P=4.18 × 10(-8)). In a stratified case-control analysis, the SNP at 5q14.3 appears specific for aggressive prostate cancer (P=8.85 × 10(-5)) with no association for nonaggressive prostate cancer compared with controls (P=0.57). The proximity of these loci to genes involved in vascular disease suggests potential biological mechanisms worthy of further investigation. 	 22941192 23023329 23128226 22549899 23193118 23065704 23535732 23650393 23715323 24183450 24399786 24321253 25217961 24240687 10695593 10835412 10825281 11189687 11172298 11176484 12015775 12082018 12639222 14601026 14639529 2535967 1555838 18264098 18426918 19767753 19767754 19861517 20080650 18596976 19117981 19132087 19297565 19543373 20676098 20868494 21390317 21318478 21465221 21602798 21467234 21737059 21743467 21743057 22064851 22200770 22116601 8105097 8205268 7477259 8732939 15876871 16173044 16932970 17401363 17401366 17486369 17603485 17921068 18048393 18264096 18264097
25944848	Genome-wide association study identifies common variants associated with pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs.	Individual variation in pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs, particularly metabolism, is an important factor to consider in pharmacological treatment in psychiatry. A large proportion of this variance is still not accounted for, but evidence so far suggests the involvement of genetic factors. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with concentration dose ratio (CDR) as sub-phenotype to assess metabolism rate of psychotropic drugs in a homogenous Norwegian sample of 1334 individuals diagnosed with a severe mental disorder. The GWAS revealed one genome-wide significant marker (rs16935279, p-value=3.95×10(-10), pperm=7.5×10(-4)) located in an intronic region of the lncRNA LOC100505718. Carriers of the minor allele have a lower metabolism rate of antiepileptic drugs compared to major allele carriers. In addition, several nominally significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CDR for antipsychotic, antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs were disclosed. We consider standardised CDR to be a useful measure of the metabolism rate of a drug. The present findings indicate that common gene variants could affect the metabolism of psychotropic drugs. This warrants further investigations into the functional mechanisms involved as it may lead to identification of predictive markers as well as novel drug targets.

25961943	The impact of low-frequency and rare variants on lipid levels.	Using a genome-wide screen of 9.6 million genetic variants achieved through 1000 Genomes Project imputation in 62,166 samples, we identify association to lipid traits in 93 loci, including 79 previously identified loci with new lead SNPs and 10 new loci, 15 loci with a low-frequency lead SNP and 10 loci with a missense lead SNP, and 2 loci with an accumulation of rare variants. In six loci, SNPs with established function in lipid genetics (CELSR2, GCKR, LIPC and APOE) or candidate missense mutations with predicted damaging function (CD300LG and TM6SF2) explained the locus associations. The low-frequency variants increased the proportion of variance explained, particularly for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol. Altogether, our results highlight the impact of low-frequency variants in complex traits and show that imputation offers a cost-effective alternative to resequencing. 	 18675811 11124529 19643913 20081858 20354512 20509871 20657596 20686565 21104887 21167468 21800138 22251874 23056405 23128226 23160641 23468663 10627514 25581432 11337480 7263700 6289314 6300187 8123642 16054041 16204452 16554528 16754720 16876123 17322881 17572673 17701901 23563608 23918046 24097068 24336170 24497850 24531328 24633158 24927523 25282103 22951892 19543373
25963972	Genetics of skin color variation in Europeans: genome-wide association studies with functional follow-up.	In the International Visible Trait Genetics (VisiGen) Consortium, we investigated the genetics of human skin color by combining a series of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a total of 17,262 Europeans with functional follow-up of discovered loci. Our GWAS provide the first genome-wide significant evidence for chromosome 20q11.22 harboring the ASIP gene being explicitly associated with skin color in Europeans. In addition, genomic loci at 5p13.2 (SLC45A2), 6p25.3 (IRF4), 15q13.1 (HERC2/OCA2), and 16q24.3 (MC1R) were confirmed to be involved in skin coloration in Europeans. In follow-up gene expression and regulation studies of 22 genes in 20q11.22, we highlighted two novel genes EIF2S2 and GSS, serving as competing functional candidates in this region and providing future research lines. A genetically inferred skin color score obtained from the 9 top-associated SNPs from 9 genes in 940 worldwide samples (HGDP-CEPH) showed a clear gradual pattern in Western Eurasians similar to the distribution of physical skin color, suggesting the used 9 SNPs as suitable markers for DNA prediction of skin color in Europeans and neighboring populations, relevant in future forensic and anthropological investigations. 	 9182807 8146154 16357253 16899407 17662893 17924335 18252222 18172690 18483556 18488026 18488028 19278628 19297406 19168544 19449448 19710684 20463881 20634204 21304890 21331090 21197618 21106759 21466661 21258399 21572415 22234890 20524875 22570637 23019145 23193274 23052946 23522626 23587773 24267888 24258680 24387634 24880339 24759085 24916375 25282103 25631878 25716572 22140526 11731797 12753395 3377516 2903772 4951818 2029092 7902381 16024819
25967671	Genome-wide association analysis identifies three new risk loci for gout arthritis in Han Chinese.	Gout is one of the most common types of inflammatory arthritis, caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around the joints. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many genetic loci associated with raised serum urate concentrations. However, hyperuricemia alone is not sufficient for the development of gout arthritis. Here we conduct a multistage GWAS in Han Chinese using 4,275 male gout patients and 6,272 normal male controls (1,255 cases and 1,848 controls were genome-wide genotyped), with an additional 1,644 hyperuricemic controls. We discover three new risk loci, 17q23.2 (rs11653176, P=1.36 × 10(-13), BCAS3), 9p24.2 (rs12236871, P=1.48 × 10(-10), RFX3) and 11p15.5 (rs179785, P=1.28 × 10(-8), KCNQ1), which contain inflammatory candidate genes. Our results suggest that these loci are most likely related to the progression from hyperuricemia to inflammatory gout, which will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of gout arthritis. 	 17701901 17572673 18922891 18834626 18711367 18711366 19177453 19503597 19543373 19808794 19692116 20056949 20383146 20516647 20413507 20581827 20634204 21205285 21931561 21983786 22064851 22138821 22395765 22696034 23263486 23298195 24703347 23975432 12378525 12499305 15100320 15188256 856219 15297300 16617102 16737784 16862161 18634142

25972035	Association of common variants in the calcium-sensing receptor gene with serum calcium levels in East Asians.	Calcium is a universal intracellular messenger that has an important role in controlling various cellular processes. In this study, we explored genetic polymorphisms to identify novel loci influencing serum calcium levels in East Asians through a two-stage genome-wide association study with the sample of 8642 unrelated Koreans (4558 for discovery and 4093 for replication). Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we discovered 963 associated SNPs in stage 1, and replicated 105 SNPs among them in stage 2. We examined them in a combined set of stage 1 and 2 samples and observed that 65 SNPs were significantly associated with serum calcium levels. Among them, rs13068893 in the CASR gene showed the strongest significance (P=3.85 × 10(-8)). Considering the high allele frequency and significance level of the rs13068893C>G in the CASR gene, this SNP may have a key role in regulating the serum calcium level. We also successfully replicated the four loci (CASR, CSTA, DGKD and GCKR) using our data set that have been previously reported to be significantly associated with calcium levels in Europeans and Indians. Further studies with more East Asian subjects or meta-analyses on them may enable validation of our results and identification of novel genetic loci associated with serum calcium levels. 	 22801476 7916660 18974171 21228780 9790183 17374704 21085122 24763700 24068962 10811290 20705733 20661308 9509247 7791841 17572673 18083096 11013439 8132750 15297300 24264723 19066294 24903972 22107799 17701901 20639394 19396169 15292296 19933162 6541017 15130894
25986216	A polymorphism in CCR1/CCR3 is associated with narcolepsy.	Etiology of narcolepsy-cataplexy involves multiple genetic and environmental factors. While the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 haplotype is strongly associated with narcolepsy, it is not sufficient for disease development. To identify additional, non-HLA susceptibility genes, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Japanese samples. An initial sample set comprising 409 cases and 1562 controls was used for the GWAS of 525,196 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located outside the HLA region. An independent sample set comprising 240 cases and 869 controls was then genotyped at 37 SNPs identified in the GWAS. We found that narcolepsy was associated with a SNP in the promoter region of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 1 (CCR1) (rs3181077, P=1.6×10(-5), odds ratio [OR]=1.86). This rs3181077 association was replicated with the independent sample set (P=0.032, OR=1.36). We measured mRNA levels of candidate genes in peripheral blood samples of 38 cases and 37 controls. CCR1 and CCR3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in patients than in healthy controls, and CCR1 mRNA levels were associated with rs3181077 genotypes. In vitro chemotaxis assays were also performed to measure monocyte migration. We observed that monocytes from carriers of the rs3181077 risk allele had lower migration indices with a CCR1 ligand. CCR1 and CCR3 are newly discovered susceptibility genes for narcolepsy. These results highlight the potential role of CCR genes in narcolepsy and support the hypothesis that patients with narcolepsy have impaired immune function. 	
25987655	Genome-wide analysis links NFATC2 with asparaginase hypersensitivity.	Asparaginase is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, hypersensitivity reactions can lead to suboptimal asparaginase exposure. Our objective was to use a genome-wide approach to identify loci associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity in children with ALL enrolled on St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) protocols Total XIIIA (n = 154), Total XV (n = 498), and Total XVI (n = 271), or Children's Oncology Group protocols POG 9906 (n = 222) and AALL0232 (n = 2163). Germline DNA was genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K, Affymetrix 6.0, or the Illumina Exome BeadChip array. In multivariate logistic regression, the intronic rs6021191 variant in nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATC2) had the strongest association with hypersensitivity (P = 4.1 × 10(-8); odds ratio [OR] = 3.11). RNA-seq data available from 65 SJCRH ALL tumor samples and 52 Yoruba HapMap samples showed that samples carrying the rs6021191 variant had higher NFATC2 expression compared with noncarriers (P = 1.1 × 10(-3) and 0.03, respectively). The top ranked nonsynonymous polymorphism was rs17885382 in HLA-DRB1 (P = 3.2 × 10(-6); OR = 1.63), which is in near complete linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele we previously observed in a candidate gene study. The strongest risk factors for asparaginase allergy are variants within genes regulating the immune response. 	 22342853 22897847 24970932 24866796 22426492 25155832 25256355 10735901 22484422 23817569 24013638 24771103 8629027 9143705 16611217 16554754 17701901 18683891 19052777 19250275 19684603 19925429 20130035 20436464 20631193 20592726 20677014 20628086 21071412 21297632 22117041 14770176 1061636 22317750 22479554
25985088	Investigation of susceptibility genes triggering lachrymal/salivary gland lesion complications in Japanese patients with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis.	Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique form of chronic pancreatitis characterized by high serum IgG4 concentration and a variety of complicating extra-pancreatic lesions. In particular, lachrymal/salivary gland lesions tend to manifest in a highly active AIP disease state, and several genes are speculated to be associated with the onset of this complication. We therefore searched for candidate susceptibility genes related to lachrymal/salivary gland lesions in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the GeneChip Human Mapping 500k Array Set (Affymetrix, CA) that was followed by fine mapping of additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strongly significant genes with TaqMan assays. Venous blood samples were obtained from 50 type 1 AIP patients with lachrymal/salivary gland lesions (A group) and 53 type 1 AIP patients without (B group). The mean values of IgG and IG4 were both significantly different (P<0.05) between the groups. SNPs that showed a significant association with the A group at the genome-wide level (P<0.0001) were identified and subsequently used in fine SNP mapping of candidate genes. In total, five SNPs had a positive association with complicated AIP (most notably rs2284932 [P=0.0000021]) and five SNPs possessed a negative association (particularly rs9371942 [P=0.00000039]). Among them, KLF7, FRMD4B, LOC101928923, and MPPED2 were further examined for complication susceptibility using additional SNPs that were not included in the GWAS. Individual genotyping of KLF7 rs2284932 revealed that the frequency of the minor C allele was significantly increased (P = 0.00062, Pc = 0.003, OR = 2.98, 95%CI = 1.58–5.65) in group A. The minor T allele of rs4473559 in FRMD4 demonstrated a significant association in the A group (P = 0.00015, OR = 3.38, 95%CI = 1.77–6.45). In the LOC101928923 gene, the frequency of the minor T allele of rs4379306 was significantly decreased in group A in both TaqMan and GWAS analyses. Lastly, the minor C allele of MPPED2 rs514644 carried a significantly increased risk of complications [corrected].These four genes may be linked with the onset of lachrymal/salivary gland lesions in type 1 AIP patients and require further study.	 19581062 15087409 17287899 19147600 16905709 11236777 19468670 15794205 11445584 17237347 24316577 18341485 15026468 22466167 11443140 11424081 22045429 22736240 22262177 15937668 15716907 15238208 10406367 14736977 11978339 23898377 17252232 11462890 17119950 16552773 18155707 23662806 22936656 15082601 15964824 11984513 11137451 17554299 15295844 19500628 10970839 12692053
25987243	Comprehensive genome-wide evaluation of lapatinib-induced liver injury yields a single genetic signal centered on known risk allele HLA-DRB1*07:01.	Lapatinib is associated with a low incidence of serious liver injury. Previous investigations have identified and confirmed the Class II allele HLA-DRB1*07:01 to be strongly associated with lapatinib-induced liver injury; however, the moderate positive predictive value limits its clinical utility. To assess whether additional genetic variants located within the major histocompatibility complex locus or elsewhere in the genome may influence lapatinib-induced liver injury risk, and potentially lead to a genetic association with improved predictive qualities, we have taken two approaches: a genome-wide association study and a whole-genome sequencing study. This evaluation did not reveal additional associations other than the previously identified association for HLA-DRB1*07:01. The present study represents the most comprehensive genetic evaluation of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) or hypersensitivity, and suggests that investigation of possible human leukocyte antigen associations with DILI and other hypersensitivities represents an important first step in understanding the mechanism of these events. 	 21570397 22017685 22286218 22357454 23234763 22987284 23762245 24452261 23712092 24687830 25017105 21428768 18256392 17505501 18549801 18838392 19483685 19561590 20354512 20602616 20639878 20562413 21245432 20980556
25987507	Heritability, SNP- and Gene-Based Analyses of Cannabis Use Initiation and Age at Onset.	Prior searches for genetic variants (GVs) implicated in initiation of cannabis use have been limited to common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typed in HapMap samples. Denser SNPs are now available with the completion of the 1000 Genomes and the Genome of the Netherlands projects. More densely distributed SNPs are expected to track the causal variants better. Therefore we extend the search for variants implicated in early stages of cannabis use to previously untagged common and low-frequency variants. We run heritability, SNP and gene-based analyses of initiation and age at onset. This is the first genome-wide study of age at onset to date. Using GCTA and a sample of distantly related individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register, we estimated that the currently measured (and tagged) SNPs collectively explain 25 % of the variance in initiation (SE = 0.088; P = 0.0016). Chromosomes 4 and 18, previously linked with cannabis use and other addiction phenotypes, account for the largest amount of variance in initiation (6.8 %, SE = 0.025, P = 0.002 and 3.6 %, SE = 0.01, P = 0.012, respectively). No individual SNP- or gene-based test reached genomewide significance in the initiation or age at onset analyses. Our study detected association signal in the currently measured SNPs. A comparison with prior SNP-heritability estimates suggests that at least part of the signal is likely coming from previously untyped common and low frequency variants. Our results do not rule out the contribution of rare variants of larger effect-a plausible source of the difference between the twin-based heritability estimate and that from GCTA. The causal variants are likely of very small effect (i.e., <1 % explained variance) and are uniformly distributed over the genome in proportion to chromosomes' length. Similar to other complex traits and diseases, detecting such small effects is to be expected in sufficiently large samples.	 16697036 9839149 18482420 17254420 24345517 23468642 11219366 23128226 12142011 16534506 24974849 19931040 18382476 26359901 22820512 18519829 12537867 23531865 25287883 22823124 24851122 16402286 18606503 24384575 11702054 20456872 20811451 23186620 23298648 21142928 21826061 18292704 24695403 24916646 20477721 19793625 20634204 17701901 12533121 9699687 21167468 23714750 21397060 24897085 10802651 20337509 20402985 21321675
25990418	A new GWAS and meta-analysis with 1000Genomes imputation identifies novel risk variants for colorectal cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified 23 susceptibility loci thus far. Analyses of previously conducted GWAS indicate additional risk loci are yet to be discovered. To identify novel CRC susceptibility loci, we conducted a new GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with five published GWAS (totalling 7,577 cases and 9,979 controls of European ancestry), imputing genotypes utilising the 1000 Genomes Project. The combined analysis identified new, significant associations with CRC at 1p36.2 marked by rs72647484 (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.09) near CDC42 and WNT4 (P = 1.21 × 10(-8), odds ratio [OR] = 1.21 ) and at 16q24.1 marked by rs16941835 (MAF = 0.21, P = 5.06 × 10(-8); OR = 1.15) within the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-58A18.1 and ~500 kb from the nearest coding gene FOXL1. Additionally we identified a promising association at 10p13 with rs10904849 intronic to CUBN (MAF = 0.32, P = 7.01 × 10(-8); OR = 1.14). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC. Additionally, our analysis further demonstrates that imputation can be used to exploit GWAS data to identify novel disease-causing variants. 	 23550210 23859033 23884297 23741067 23796952 23955597 24012455 23996088 10866202 10891514 11693338 11717447 12111919 9572993 9823339 15965027 16228001 16155052 24279335 24390350 24487276 24703531 24836286 24737748 25105248 23263487 23266556 17200375 17401363 17529973 17572673 17618284 17701901 17934461 17982118 18372901 18372905 18579814 19307499 19543373 19654303 20418889 20657582 20837956 20972440 21242260 21655089 21641636 21531791 21804547 22138821 22588877 22467564 22634755 23061900 23128226 15371327

26007630	Variants in ELL2 influencing immunoglobulin levels associate with multiple myeloma.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by an uninhibited, clonal growth of plasma cells. While first-degree relatives of patients with MM show an increased risk of MM, the genetic basis of inherited MM susceptibility is incompletely understood. Here we report a genome-wide association study in the Nordic region identifying a novel MM risk locus at ELL2 (rs56219066T; odds ratio (OR)=1.25; P=9.6 × 10(-10)). This gene encodes a stoichiometrically limiting component of the super-elongation complex that drives secretory-specific immunoglobulin mRNA production and transcriptional regulation in plasma cells. We find that the MM risk allele harbours a Thr298Ala missense variant in an ELL2 domain required for transcription elongation. Consistent with a hypomorphic effect, we find that the MM risk allele also associates with reduced levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and G (IgG) in healthy subjects (P=8.6 × 10(-9) and P=6.4 × 10(-3), respectively) and, potentially, with an increased risk of bacterial meningitis (OR=1.30; P=0.0024). 	 18025212 18344981 18614782 19165921 19179464 19182202 19582882 19749764 19608666 20016592 20562413 20616382 20644199 25807286 11315092 11584064 14517540 9108030 16571879 16753294 17023574 17701901 20811451 20574050 21085122 21090965 21241896 21430775 20517342 21717070 21994415 22120009 22483617 22895430 22991471 23022100 23128226 23269371 23502783 23644456 24037378 23955597 23974872 24013639 24466310 24247655 25238757 25439696 19234139 19543373 19179466

26014426	Genome-wide association study with 1000 genomes imputation identifies signals for nine sex hormone-related phenotypes.	Genetic factors contribute strongly to sex hormone levels, yet knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms remains incomplete. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only a small number of loci associated with sex hormone levels, with several reproductive hormones yet to be assessed. The aim of the study was to identify novel genetic variants contributing to the regulation of sex hormones. We performed GWAS using genotypes imputed from the 1000 Genomes reference panel. The study used genotype and phenotype data from a UK twin register. We included 2913 individuals (up to 294 males) from the Twins UK study, excluding individuals receiving hormone treatment. Phenotypes were standardised for age, sex, BMI, stage of menstrual cycle and menopausal status. We tested 7,879,351 autosomal SNPs for association with levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), oestradiol, free androgen index (FAI), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, progesterone, sex hormone-binding globulin and testosterone. Eight independent genetic variants reached genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), with minor allele frequencies of 1.3-23.9%. Novel signals included variants for progesterone (P=7.68 × 10(-12)), oestradiol (P=1.63 × 10(-8)) and FAI (P=1.50 × 10(-8)). A genetic variant near the FSHB gene was identified which influenced both FSH (P=1.74 × 10(-8)) and LH (P=3.94 × 10(-9)) levels. A separate locus on chromosome 7 was associated with both DHEAS (P=1.82 × 10(-14)) and progesterone (P=6.09 × 10(-14)). This study highlights loci that are relevant to reproductive function and suggests overlap in the genetic basis of hormone regulation.	 23766128 24049095 23541950 10548883 10634790 11940601 12475460 12915441 15106032 6607757 1562592 8964583 15985487 16390776 16616457 18567894 18974171 19933169 20634204 19448619 21102462 20517342 21533175 21733993 21998597 22064851 22086963 22267201 22675492 22706312 22717648 22829776 22885924 22941192 22936694 23155063 23118424 23088889 23506881 23696881 24487584 24763738
26058915	Genetic loci for serum magnesium among African-Americans and gene-environment interaction at MUC1 and TRPM6 in European-Americans: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.	Low serum magnesium levels have been associated with multiple chronic diseases. The regulation of serum magnesium homeostasis is not well understood. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of European ancestry (EA) populations identified nine loci for serum magnesium. No such study has been conducted in African-Americans, nor has there been an evaluation of the interaction of magnesium-associated SNPs with environmental factors. The goals of this study were to identify genetic loci associated with serum magnesium in an African-American (AA) population using both genome-wide and candidate region interrogation approaches and to evaluate gene-environment interaction for the magnesium-associated variants in both EA and AA populations. We conducted a GWAS of serum magnesium in 2737 AA participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and interrogated the regions of the nine published candidate loci in these results. Literature search identified the influence of progesterone on MUC1 expression and insulin on TRPM6 expression.	 22064851 17701901 22955989 22955828 23715323 23719551 24089412 25272232 11159362 11289468 12010365 12193151 14633821 5806042 2646917 8192558 9443780 10192647 10527292 17641781 16595724 17943122 19414839 20562874 20700443 20616382 20828101 20517342 21931561 15845589 22733750
26025379	Genome-wide association study of toxic metals and trace elements reveals novel associations.	The accumulation of toxic metals in the human body is influenced by exposure and mechanisms involved in metabolism, some of which may be under genetic control. This is the first genome-wide association study to investigate variants associated with whole blood levels of a range of toxic metals. Eleven toxic metals and trace elements (aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, chromium, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead and zinc) were assayed in a cohort of 949 individuals using mass spectrometry. DNA samples were genotyped on the Infinium Omni Express bead microarray and imputed up to reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. Analyses revealed two regions associated with manganese level at genome-wide significance, mapping to 4q24 and 1q41. The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 4q24 locus was rs13107325 (P-value = 5.1 × 10(-11), β = -0.77), located in an exon of SLC39A8, which encodes a protein involved in manganese and zinc transport. The lead SNP in the 1q41 locus is rs1776029 (P-value = 2.2 × 10(-14), β = -0.46). The SNP lies within the intronic region of SLC30A10, another transporter protein. Among other metals, the loci 6q14.1 and 3q26.32 were associated with cadmium and mercury levels (P = 1.4 × 10(-10), β = -1.2 and P = 1.8 × 10(-9), β = -1.8, respectively). Whole blood measurements of toxic metals are associated with genetic variants in metal transporter genes and others. This is relevant in inferring metabolic pathways of metals and identifying subsets of individuals who may be more susceptible to metal toxicity. 	 21909115 23118587 17922683 21652639 11315092 21526222 16961004 23991990 23128226 21762725 21925580 10393136 25136353 24744764 12460796 22178028 22078303 15154973 24894749 22341972 20864672 25184405 16630819 21130836 20686565 22820512 20935630 22465267 16219356 16141402 20053595 16961932 1415012 23720494 23072989 23052037 22447645 24069296 19561590 10964791 23416510 17718178 25319704 23362303 24376795 22341971 9242408 20601685 21670538 21767559 19808796 19016750
26029870	Common variants at 10p12.31, 10q21.1 and 13q12.13 are associated with sporadic pituitary adenoma.	Pituitary adenoma is one of the most common intracranial neoplasms, and its genetic basis remains largely unknown. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for sporadic pituitary adenoma, we performed a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Han Chinese population. We first analyzed genome-wide SNP data in 771 pituitary adenoma cases and 2,788 controls and then carried forward the promising variants for replication in another 2 independent sets (2,542 cases and 3,620 controls in total). We identified three new susceptibility loci below the genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in the combined analyses: 10p12.31 (rs2359536, P(meta) = 2.25 × 10(-10) and rs10828088, P(meta) = 6.27 × 10(-10)), 10q21.1 (rs10763170, P(meta) = 6.88 × 10(-10)) and 13q12.13 (rs17083838, P(meta) = 1.89 × 10(-8)). This study is the first GWAS to our knowledge on sporadic pituitary adenoma, and our results provide insight into the genetic basis of this disease.	 24431196 24481996 25350067 16611538 16862161 22542470 24035864 17082898 23128226 19945022 24197660 20012699 17612495 23689382 23389630 19395286 11429292 22820512 18794899 19107147 22796941 21804547 24563334 23535730 15297300 18852200 18794900 18828157 21074690 22806308 19564887 20437278 21179167 23677069 12154016 20634204 17701901 18079202 23269371 25174004 18256235 23535729 21344156 20200074 19816713 11398101
26028593	Identification of new susceptibility loci for IgA nephropathy in Han Chinese.	IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common primary glomerulonephritis. Previously identified genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci explain only a fraction of disease risk. To identify novel susceptibility loci in Han Chinese, we conduct a four-stage GWAS comprising 8,313 cases and 19,680 controls. Here, we show novel associations at ST6GAL1 on 3q27.3 (rs7634389, odds ratio (OR)=1.13, P=7.27 × 10(-10)), ACCS on 11p11.2 (rs2074038, OR=1.14, P=3.93 × 10(-9)) and ODF1-KLF10 on 8q22.3 (rs2033562, OR=1.13, P=1.41 × 10(-9)), validate a recently reported association at ITGAX-ITGAM on 16p11.2 (rs7190997, OR=1.22, P=2.26 × 10(-19)), and identify three independent signals within the DEFA locus (rs2738058, P=1.15 × 10(-19); rs12716641, P=9.53 × 10(-9); rs9314614, P=4.25 × 10(-9), multivariate association). The risk variants on 3q27.3 and 11p11.2 show strong association with mRNA expression levels in blood cells while allele frequencies of the risk variants within ST6GAL1, ACCS and DEFA correlate with geographical variation in IgAN prevalence. Our findings expand our understanding on IgAN genetic susceptibility and provide novel biological insights into molecular mechanisms underlying IgAN. 	 11315092 23072577 16862161 25070946 22384356 21930713 19571790 16039093 12499305 22064851 16189514 24698974 24316577 22138821 9463333 17572673 22737082 19571791 22820512 23762245 23782179 18838552 21399633 22446964 19944401 21701837 25470037 19557189 24138543 24531419 10639137 15052270 22197929 9690558 22955989 20634204 17701901 25305756 11254454 19543373 24013639 22706312 20502117
26030142	Genome-Wide Association Study of Serum Creatinine Levels during Vancomycin Therapy.	Vancomycin, a commonly used antibiotic, can be nephrotoxic. Known risk factors such as age, creatinine clearance, vancomycin dose / dosing interval, and concurrent nephrotoxic medications fail to accurately predict nephrotoxicity. To identify potential genomic risk factors, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of serum creatinine levels while on vancomycin in 489 European American individuals and validated findings in three independent cohorts totaling 439 European American individuals. In primary analyses, the chromosome 6q22.31 locus was associated with increased serum creatinine levels while on vancomycin therapy (most significant variant rs2789047, risk allele A, β = -0.06, p = 1.1 x 10(-7)). SNPs in this region had consistent directions of effect in the validation cohorts, with a meta-p of 1.1 x 10(-7). Variation in this region on chromosome 6, which includes the genes TBC1D32/C6orf170 and GJA1 (encoding connexin43), may modulate risk of vancomycin-induced kidney injury.	 18929686 19434714 10835412 24786321 24987407 19106348 17572673 21429966 22411630 20686651 20383145 20616382 17106010 21269473 20383146 20649601 24285566 18271029 18500243 21130609 22149255 19430482 17701901 22479191 17060545 12414508 22326026 19543373

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the presence of airflow limitation on spirometry, yet subjects with COPD can have marked differences in computed tomography imaging. These differences may be driven by genetic factors. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of quantitative imaging would identify loci not previously identified in analyses of COPD or spirometry. In addition, we sought to determine whether previously described genome-wide significant COPD and spirometric loci were associated with emphysema or airway phenotypes.	 19179485 24628319 24383474 21474499 24928812 21445957 19059958 20935108 25555482 23188423 22937864 22064851 14647417 22080838 21139605 23284291 21788524 17363767 21940776 17521951 21565292 18846446 15955094 20541380 22820512 21037115 16888288 23209423 25517131 20595457 18565956 20010834 23600492 18565949 22837378 18852200 23972146 20435672 15563631 19300482 18718906 17932950 24498031 23723249 21946350 18568842 4159957 12759479 19051285 23971478 20173748 23947473 22016444 25006744 22028353 22513993 20010835 24983825 19926869 24428606 10988137 11104784 20214461 19300500 20709820 18216052 21757622 24621683
26034056	A large multiethnic genome-wide association study of prostate cancer identifies novel risk variants and substantial ethnic differences.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer in Kaiser Permanente health plan members (7,783 cases, 38,595 controls; 80.3% non-Hispanic white, 4.9% African-American, 7.0% East Asian, and 7.8% Latino) revealed a new independent risk indel rs4646284 at the previously identified locus 6q25.3 that replicated in PEGASUS (N = 7,539) and the Multiethnic Cohort (N = 4,679) with an overall P = 1.0 × 10(-19) (OR, 1.18). Across the 6q25.3 locus, rs4646284 exhibited the strongest association with expression of SLC22A1 (P = 1.3 × 10(-23)) and SLC22A3 (P = 3.2 × 10(-52)). At the known 19q13.33 locus, rs2659124 (P = 1.3 × 10(-13); OR, 1.18) nominally replicated in PEGASUS. A risk score of 105 known risk SNPs was strongly associated with prostate cancer (P < 1.0 × 10(-8)). Comparing the highest to lowest risk score deciles, the OR was 6.22 for non-Hispanic whites, 5.82 for Latinos, 3.77 for African-Americans, and 3.38 for East Asians. In non-Hispanic whites, the 105 risk SNPs explained approximately 7.6% of disease heritability. The entire GWAS array explained approximately 33.4% of heritability, with a 4.3-fold enrichment within DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (P = 0.004).	 23065704 21318478 11315092 17401366 24270787 16862161 22366784 22384356 25274378 21390317 18264096 21602798 25439723 19165914 7749817 19767754 18264098 22923026 14749351 25629170 10891514 22138821 20676098 22056501 25044450 21565292 23269536 22820512 21743057 25983244 21376301 24907074 23535732 15737078 20517342 23737753 17401363 20579941 17401364 24812039 19767753 25378343 19680443 7829245 18703928 21167468 21565264 19117981 25371445 23023329 19767752 21254217 19543373 21903159 16813653 7535977 21743467 10695593
26031901	Genome-wide association study of leukotriene modifier response in asthma.	Heterogeneous therapeutic responses to leukotriene modifiers (LTMs) are likely due to variation in patient genetics. Although prior candidate gene studies implicated multiple pharmacogenetic loci, to date, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) of LTM response was reported. In this study, DNA and phenotypic information from two placebo-controlled trials (total N=526) of zileuton response were interrogated. Using a gene-environment (G × E) GWAS model, we evaluated 12-week change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ΔFEV1) following LTM treatment. The top 50 single-nucleotide polymorphism associations were replicated in an independent zileuton treatment cohort, and two additional cohorts of montelukast response. In a combined analysis (discovery+replication), rs12436663 in MRPP3 achieved genome-wide significance (P=6.28 × 10(-08)); homozygous rs12436663 carriers showed a significant reduction in mean ΔFEV1 following zileuton treatment. In addition, rs517020 in GLT1D1 was associated with worsening responses to both montelukast and zileuton (combined P=1.25 × 10(-07)). These findings implicate previously unreported loci in determining therapeutic responsiveness to LTMs. 	 11359637 23434633 6316129 2825898 2649653 2341393 2283726 1618602 8218172 9057778 10169531 10369259 16293801 16998094 17397245 17507702 17530530 17701901 17718106 18984158 19077707 19151602 19214143 19416143 20136554 20634204 20953189 21681015 21991891 22482804 22538805 6311078
26220383	GWAS identifies two susceptibility loci for lamotrigine-induced skin rash in patients with epilepsy.	Lamotrigine (LTG)-induced maculopapular eruption (MPE) often causes treatment discontinuation and rising burdens on current healthcare systems. We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify novel susceptibility loci associated with LTG-induced MPE in patients with epilepsy.	
26041818	A trans-ethnic genome-wide association study identifies gender-specific loci influencing pediatric aBMD and BMC at the distal radius.	Childhood fractures are common, with the forearm being the most common site. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 60 loci associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in adults but less is known about genetic influences specific to bone in childhood. To identify novel genetic factors that influence pediatric bone strength at a common site for childhood fractures, we performed a sex-stratified trans-ethnic genome-wide association study of areal BMD (aBMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) Z-scores measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at the one-third distal radius, in a cohort of 1399 children without clinical abnormalities in bone health. We tested signals with P < 5 × 10(-6) for replication in an independent, same-age cohort of 486 Caucasian children. Two loci yielded a genome-wide significant combined P-value: rs7797976 within CPED1 in females [P = 2.4 × 10(-11), β =- 0.30 standard deviations (SD) per T allele; aBMD-Z] and rs7035284 at 9p21.3 in males (P = 1.2 × 10(-8), β = 0.28 SD per G allele; BMC-Z). Signals at the CPED1-WNT16-FAM3C locus have been previously associated with BMD at other skeletal sites in adults and children. Our result at the distal radius underscores the importance of this locus at multiple skeletal sites. The 9p21.3 locus is within a gene desert, with the nearest gene flanking each side being MIR31HG and MTAP, neither of which has been implicated in BMD or BMC previously. These findings suggest that genetic determinants of childhood bone accretion at the radius, a skeletal site that is primarily cortical bone, exist and also differ by sex. 	 11256898 3520321 8093403 10024374 16939408 17311856 17632545 17701901 18058055 19084202 19181680 19557189 19648217 19644074 19801982 20056006 20103654 20702402 21030618 20505365 21917867 22344299 22464254 22532805 22504420 22706312 22792070 22792071 22805710 22941192 23389618 24316577 24667836 24690232 24945404 25306233 25034128 25762182
26049409	A genome-wide association study of late-onset Alzheimer's disease in a Japanese population.	Although a number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have been carried out, there have been little GWAS data on East Asian populations.	
25979521	Genome-wide interaction study of gene-by-occupational exposure and effects on FEV1 levels.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease characterized by impaired lung function and airway obstruction resulting from interactions between multiple genes and multiple environmental exposures. Thus far, genome-wide association studies have largely disregarded environmental factors that might trigger the development of lung function impairment and COPD, such as occupational exposures, which are thought to contribute to 15% to 20% of the COPD prevalence.	
26053186	Mercapturic Acids Derived from the Toxicants Acrolein and Crotonaldehyde in the Urine of Cigarette Smokers from Five Ethnic Groups with Differing Risks for Lung Cancer.	The Multiethnic Cohort epidemiology study has clearly demonstrated that, compared to Whites and for the same number of cigarettes smoked, African Americans and Native Hawaiians have a higher risk for lung cancer whereas Latinos and Japanese Americans have a lower risk. Acrolein and crotonaldehyde are two important constituents of cigarette smoke which have well documented toxic effects and could play a role in lung cancer etiology. Their urinary metabolites 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3-HPMA) and 3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid (HMPMA), respectively, are validated biomarkers of acrolein and crotonaldehyde exposure. We quantified levels of 3-HPMA and HMPMA in the urine of more than 2200 smokers from these five ethnic groups, and also carried out a genome wide association study using blood samples from these subjects. After adjusting for age, sex, creatinine, and total nicotine equivalents, geometric mean levels of 3-HPMA and HMPMA were significantly different in the five groups (P < 0.0001). Native Hawaiians had the highest and Latinos the lowest geometric mean levels of both 3-HPMA and HMPMA. Levels of 3-HPMA and HMPMA were 3787 and 2759 pmol/ml urine, respectively, in Native Hawaiians and 1720 and 2210 pmol/ml urine in Latinos. These results suggest that acrolein and crotonaldehyde may be involved in lung cancer etiology, and that their divergent levels may partially explain the differing risks of Native Hawaiian and Latino smokers. No strong signals were associated with 3-HPMA in the genome wide association study, suggesting that formation of the glutathione conjugate of acrolein is mainly non-enzymatic, while the top significant association with HMPMA was located on chromosome 12 near the TBX3 gene, but its relationship to HMPMA excretion is not clear.	 9710952 10064851 10413421 15734728 16436765 17040109 17030796 17334178 17365769 17385896 17318410 18203133 18666198 19135121 19231900 19317515 19397281 19543373 19539004 19700523 19696094 20223085 20408564 21105653 21090699 21296855 21436064 21704744 20303374 20937342 22138821 22298640 22275365 23126278 23431959 23633528 23934173 24148823 24939871 25233931 25269804 25293881 25542827 10695593 10799737 11204217 11451816 11700268 11896684 11979440 12684197 15041144 7287220 6825094 6318992 3902372 3002613 3180100 2304453 1306091 8225730 8108434 7501665 8895475 8988725 9139128 9560197 9625726

26154020	A genome-wide screening and SNPs-to-genes approach to identify novel genetic risk factors associated with frontotemporal dementia.	Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most prevalent form of early onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a case-control association study in an Italian FTD cohort (n = 530) followed by the novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-to-genes approach and functional annotation analysis. We identified 2 novel potential loci for FTD. Suggestive SNPs reached p-values ∼10(-7) and odds ratio > 2.5 (2p16.3) and 1.5 (17q25.3). Suggestive alleles at 17q25.3 identified a disease-associated haplotype causing decreased expression of -cis genes such as RFNG and AATK involved in neuronal genesis and differentiation and axon outgrowth, respectively. We replicated this locus through the SNPs-to-genes approach. Our functional annotation analysis indicated significant enrichment for functions of the brain (neuronal genesis, differentiation, and maturation), the synapse (neurotransmission and synapse plasticity), and elements of the immune system, the latter supporting our recent international FTD-genome-wide association study. This is the largest genome-wide study in Italian FTD to date. Although our results are not conclusive, we set the basis for future replication studies and identification of susceptible molecular mechanisms involved in FTD pathogenesis.	 21058334 15489396 21397060 21325651 21460840 21555637 21685912 21810890 21944778 21944779 21986680 21399481 21242203 22184326 22472443 22573681 22710912 22797915 24071869 23688578 24064469 24205929 24169076 24121957 24487234 24387224 24943344 23533028 8786847 9191760 9641683 9693262 9855500 16606683 16862115 16862116 17784955 18577223 19131956 19101631 19188922 19462523 19734901 19734902 19734903 20154673 20460622 20560208 21085122 23535649 23741293 23546992 10802651 11165380 11314039 11901276 12058088 12565146 15036621 20645878
26068415	Genome-wide association study identifies novel genetic variants contributing to variation in blood metabolite levels.	Metabolites are small molecules involved in cellular metabolism, which can be detected in biological samples using metabolomic techniques. Here we present the results of genome-wide association and meta-analyses for variation in the blood serum levels of 129 metabolites as measured by the Biocrates metabolomic platform. In a discovery sample of 7,478 individuals of European descent, we find 4,068 genome- and metabolome-wide significant (Z-test, P < 1.09 × 10(-9)) associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and metabolites, involving 59 independent SNPs and 85 metabolites. Five of the fifty-nine independent SNPs are new for serum metabolite levels, and were followed-up for replication in an independent sample (N = 1,182). The novel SNPs are located in or near genes encoding metabolite transporter proteins or enzymes (SLC22A16, ARG1, AGPS and ACSL1) that have demonstrated biomedical or pharmaceutical importance. The further characterization of genetic influences on metabolic phenotypes is important for progress in biological and medical research.	 23985338 19474294 21447597 10592173 19043545 16381841 20176858 17943122 20037140 14597658 21990100 20179710 19477356 16077740 25288136 20509871 20616382 20567237 21378990 22156771 23202125 22359512 24905732 22803961 21886157 22464876 23563607 24816252 23823483 21931564 20037589 23032255 16788709 21875899 12824418 20634204 21852955 17701901 18348202 21167468 19571811 22286219 19798445 10802651 24625756 21071422
26075790	Genome-wide significant risk associations for mucinous ovarian carcinoma.	Genome-wide association studies have identified several risk associations for ovarian carcinomas but not for mucinous ovarian carcinomas (MOCs). Our analysis of 1,644 MOC cases and 21,693 controls with imputation identified 3 new risk associations: rs752590 at 2q13 (P = 3.3 × 10(-8)), rs711830 at 2q31.1 (P = 7.5 × 10(-12)) and rs688187 at 19q13.2 (P = 6.8 × 10(-13)). We identified significant expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) associations for HOXD9 at 2q31.1 in ovarian (P = 4.95 × 10(-4), false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.003) and colorectal (P = 0.01, FDR = 0.09) tumors and for PAX8 at 2q13 in colorectal tumors (P = 0.03, FDR = 0.09). Chromosome conformation capture analysis identified interactions between the HOXD9 promoter and risk-associated SNPs at 2q31.1. Overexpressing HOXD9 in MOC cells augmented the neoplastic phenotype. These findings provide the first evidence for MOC susceptibility variants and insights into the underlying biology of the disease. 	 23535729 23535730 23535731 23535732 23544013 23456270 23935528 24119843 24766781 11207821 11812077 11852993 12604884 12826891 12970747 15077121 15297962 4016686 3476184 2841597 16508639 16862161 16807757 17148771 18162780 18602670 19053170 19543373 19561607 19648919 20852632 20852633 20972440 20931559 21351269 21228123 21552115 21482675 21600039 21720365 21746896 21941283 21616717 22006311 22138821 22256951 22361336 22810696 22711857 23374354 23420232 23535648 23535649 25134534 24907074 25329461 25581431 20414098 2270482 2065292 8261457 7922985 7742004 7503361 8712193 9038264 9118042 15626914 16144910

Testing for association of CBD with top progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified associations at MOBP (3p22; rs1768208; P=2.07 × 10(-7)) and MAPT H1c (17q21; rs242557; P=7.91 × 10(-6)). We previously reported SNP/transcript level associations with rs8070723/MAPT, rs242557/MAPT, and rs1768208/MOBP and herein identified association with rs963731/SOS1. We identify new CBD susceptibility loci and show that CBD and PSP share a genetic risk factor other than MAPT at 3p22 MOBP (myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein). 	 10072441 21685912 5634369 22384356 23128226 12628188 16864656 22685416 21933807 22064851 25443551 16195395 14502669 10489043 7989345 10580705 19200528 10716259 8395566 23359374 24469637 24121548 11087782 25175602 20634204 17701901 12430710 24094745 7782322 21487420 10859302 21441907 10522876 12057909 11425937 20584946
26079190	A genome-wide association study of suicidal behavior.	Genome wide array studies have reported limited success in identifying genetic markers conferring risk for suicidal behavior (SB). This may be attributable to study designs with primary outcome other than SB. We performed a GWAS on suicides and cases with a history of nonfatal suicide attempts compared with psychiatric controls and healthy volunteers. A consortium of USA, Canadian and German teams assembled two groups of cases (suicide attempters and suicides, N = 577) and non-attempter psychiatric and healthy controls (N = 1,233). Logistic regression was used to test genotype-suicidal behavior association. The test was repeated separating suicide attempt and completed suicide as outcomes. No SNP reached genome-wide significance, but several SNPs within STK3, ADAMTS14, PSME2, and TBX20 genes reached P < 1 × 10(-5) . The top SNPs for the suicide attempt analysis included two from DPP10, one from CTNNA3 and one from STK32B. In the suicide analysis we found seven SNPs from the TBX20 gene in the top hits. Pathway analysis identified the following pathways: "Cellular Assembly and Organization," "Nervous System Development and Function," "Cell Death and Survival," "Immunological Disease," "Infectious Disease," and "Inflammatory Response." The top genes in the SB analysis did not overlap with those in the ideation analysis. No genome wide significant results suggest that susceptibility to SB has genetic risk factors with smaller effect sizes. The strongest candidate genes, ADAMTS14, and PSME2 (both linked to inflammatory response), STK3 (neuronal cell death), and TBX20 (brainstem motor neuron development), have not been previously reported in association with suicide and warrant further study.	
26084801	A Genome-Wide Scan Identifies Variants in NFIB Associated with Metastasis in Patients with Osteosarcoma.	Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone malignancy. We conducted a multistage genome-wide association study of osteosarcoma metastasis at diagnosis in 935 osteosarcoma patients to determine whether germline genetic variation contributes to risk of metastasis. We identified an SNP, rs7034162, in NFIB significantly associated with metastasis in European osteosarcoma cases, as well as in cases of African and Brazilian ancestry (meta-analysis of all cases: P = 1.2 × 10(-9); OR, 2.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-3.24). The risk allele was significantly associated with lowered NFIB expression, which led to increased osteosarcoma cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation. In addition, a transposon screen in mice identified a significant proportion of osteosarcomas harboring inactivating insertions in Nfib and with lowered NFIB expression. These data suggest that germline genetic variation at rs7034162 is important in osteosarcoma metastasis and that NFIB is an osteosarcoma metastasis susceptibility gene.	 21925980 22666420 20205169 21764851 17194218 22328518 23824394 21437228 10831836 21460855 8168113 11606061 22200770 11821461 19841262 23205180 19197972 22064851 18384814 7890280 20702610 21465145 18003717 12218590 17572673 19132750 19330840 22955616 18809517 12958120 21931803 23685747 23172052 23665505 19526364 21866554 21965725 21667022 12743156 24949940 12177108 26139635 11874691 8445419 18663748 25961939 22955989 20981092 16015627 10726973 25075009 19837271 23727862 9762887 23688189 24556621 7684391 23569316 19349163
26039976	Genome-Wide Association Studies of HIV-1 Host Control in Ethnically Diverse Chinese Populations.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed several genetic loci associated with HIV-1 outcome following infection (e.g., HLA-C at 6p21.33) in multi-ethnic populations with genetic heterogeneity and racial/ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-Americans, and Hispanics. To systematically investigate the inherited predisposition to modulate HIV-1 infection in Chinese populations, we performed GWASs in three ethnically diverse HIV-infected patients groups (i.e., HAN, YUN, and XIN, N = 538). The reported loci at 6p21.33 was validated in HAN (e.g., rs9264942, P = 0.0018). An independent association signal (rs2442719, P = 7.85 × 10(-7), HAN group) in the same region was observed. Imputation results suggest that haplotype HLA-B*13:02/C*06:02, which can partially account for the GWAS signal, is associated with lower viral load in Han Chinese. Moreover, several novel loci were identified using GWAS approach including the top association signals at 6q13 (KCNQ5, rs947612, P = 2.15 × 10(-6)), 6p24.1 (PHACTR1, rs202072, P = 3.8 × 10(-6)), and 11q12.3 (SCGB1D4, rs11231017, P = 7.39 × 10(-7)) in HAN, YUN, and XIN groups, respectively. Our findings imply shared or specific mechanisms for host control of HIV-1 in ethnically diverse Chinese populations, which may shed new light on individualized HIV/AIDS therapy in China.	 11943262 17194218 16862161 20660184 8918278 20041166 18219363 17893201 23559252 8655357 24904572 22125221 22718199 19276793 17076553 20395969 22290423 17251285 23462218 23020875 18945768 21051598 22474021 2038058 23512250 21499264 16998491 19703245 22962707 20634204 15821402 17701901 19935663 20802296 17641165 10694578 22999948 10528870 15592417 14685227 23750159 22575339 3412472 23646949 20205591
26083242	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Pharmacogenomic Loci For Therapeutic Response to Montelukast in Asthma.	Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful tool to identify novel pharmacogenetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are a major class of asthma medications, and genetic factors contribute to variable responses to these drugs. We used GWAS to identify novel SNPs associated with the response to the LTRA, montelukast, in asthmatics.	 19214143 11359637 9555757 15696076 10369259 18551035 17507702 19151602 24486069 21837245 9246601 17718106 20046412 17397245 2825898 9498966 8598621 16998094 21307858 18547289 1310055 22370858 16502481 11897984 17140647 19077707 20810156 6316129 6311078 17701901 22538805 10589677 20067482 17460547 16293801 19416143 18371451 19933162 9647605 15128701
26081443	Genome-Wide Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Alcohol Consumption Across Youth and Early Adulthood.	The public health burden of alcohol is unevenly distributed across the life course, with levels of use, abuse, and dependence increasing across adolescence and peaking in early adulthood. Here, we leverage this temporal patterning to search for common genetic variants predicting developmental trajectories of alcohol consumption. Comparable psychiatric evaluations measuring alcohol consumption were collected in three longitudinal community samples (N=2,126, obs=12,166). Consumption-repeated measurements spanning adolescence and early adulthood were analyzed using linear mixed models, estimating individual consumption trajectories, which were then tested for association with Illumina 660W-Quad genotype data (866,099 SNPs after imputation and QC). Association results were combined across samples using standard meta-analysis methods. Four meta-analysis associations satisfied our pre-determined genome-wide significance criterion (FDR<0.1) and six others met our 'suggestive' criterion (FDR<0.2). Genome-wide significant associations were highly biological plausible, including associations within GABA transporter 1, SLC6A1 (solute carrier family 6, member 1), and exonic hits in LOC100129340 (mitofusin-1-like). Pathway analyses elaborated single marker results, indicating significant enriched associations to intuitive biological mechanisms, including neurotransmission, xenobiotic pharmacodynamics, and nuclear hormone receptors (NHR). These findings underscore the value of combining longitudinal behavioral data and genome-wide genotype information in order to study developmental patterns and improve statistical power in genomic studies.	 16172611 16586152 16869226 22301922 22041458 22614290 18852200 18821565 19118814 18930379 18607529 19581569 19561601 19576574 20202923 20190752 20233392 19346277 20201924 20731965 20619826 21058334 19721433 21071422 21107309 20195266 21140256 10570485 10638066 10836917 11437801 12721631 12815749 12831111 12883005 15010446 16855000 16987876 16894614 17554300 17194218 17701901 17612790 18391951 18311194 18404147 18519825 21471458 21455730 21529783 21956439 21070505 22293009 15164086 15369681 7168798 8382006 7832260 8710190 8956679 9135032 9294370 9403953 9635230 10102725 15897727 16240551
26083729	Genetics of Plasma Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products and Cardiovascular Outcomes in a Community-based Population: Results from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.	Plasma soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (sRAGE) is a strong marker of vascular outcomes although evidence on the direction of association is mixed. Compared to whites, blacks have lower levels of sRAGE. We hypothesized that genetic determinants of sRAGE would help clarify the causal role of sRAGE and the black-white difference in sRAGE levels. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of sRAGE in whites and blacks from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Median plasma sRAGE levels were lower in blacks than whites (728 vs. 1067 pg/ml; P<0.0001). The T (vs. C) allele of rs2070600, a missense variant in AGER, the gene encoding RAGE, was associated with approximately 50% lower sRAGE levels in both whites (N = 1,737; P = 7.26x10-16; minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.04) and blacks (N = 581; P = 0.02; MAF = 0.01). In blacks, the T (vs. C) allele of rs2071288, intronic to AGER, was associated with 43% lower sRAGE levels (P = 2.22x10-8; MAF = 0.10) and was nearly absent in whites. These AGER SNPs explained 21.5% and 26% of the variation in sRAGE in blacks and whites, respectively, but did not explain the black-white difference in sRAGE. These SNPs were not significantly associated with incident death, coronary heart disease, diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease in whites (N = 8,130-9,017) or blacks (N = 2,293-2,871) (median follow up ~20 years). We identified strong genetic determinants of sRAGE that did not explain the large black-white difference in sRAGE levels or clearly influence risk of clinical outcomes, suggesting that sRAGE may not be a causal factor in development of these outcomes. 	 20981092 18507206 21316677 21622207 21771973 21906738 22146151 22682683 22588996 23236395 23396398 23894685 24094745 23947473 24155913 24159078 24303504 24246851 24681576 11108954 2646917 10075613 16728681 19013748 19275767 18926539 19448391 19366975 19524346 19890027 20567859 20522598 20634204 16862161 17224333 17554300 17876282 21298413

26083657	Genome-wide association study of acute kidney injury after coronary bypass graft surgery identifies susceptibility loci.	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious complication of cardiac surgery. Since prior studies have supported a genetic basis for postoperative AKI, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AKI following coronary bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The discovery data set consisted of 873 nonemergent CABG surgery patients with cardiopulmonary bypass (PEGASUS), while a replication data set had 380 cardiac surgical patients (CATHGEN). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were based on Illumina Human610-Quad (PEGASUS) and OMNI1-Quad (CATHGEN) BeadChips. We used linear regression with adjustment for a clinical AKI risk score to test SNP associations with the postoperative peak rise relative to preoperative serum creatinine concentration as a quantitative AKI trait. Nine SNPs meeting significance in the discovery set were detected. The rs13317787 in GRM7|LMCD1-AS1 intergenic region (3p21.6) and rs10262995 in BBS9 (7p14.3) were replicated with significance in the CATHGEN data set and exhibited significantly strong overall association following meta-analysis. Additional fine mapping using imputed SNPs across these two regions and meta-analysis found genome-wide significance at the GRM7|LMCD1-AS1 locus and a significantly strong association at BBS9. Thus, through an unbiased GWAS approach, we found two new loci associated with post-CABG AKI providing new insights into the pathogenesis of perioperative AKI.	 24391727 21246219 15153571 16159830 20177705 16862161 17331245 10616852 17715262 18948034 16380913 20338313 25018918 15754274 19608704 22064851 19406978 19523844 19443624 19252258 22713813 20472660 21931561 18287601 18382440 19414839 17572673 19859063 21742104 17283267 15339995 12608979 15276511 23904226 20383145 20616382 19184668 23716571 19118153 10940726 10910477 15297300 22186469 20383146 19638179 24445744 15312219 15563558 9454527 12044429 10344355 19430482 22955989 17921131 24119985 17701901 24886787 12023385 22797727 17846294 16106006 24176074 21911804 12618763 19119412 21270763 18379238

26087016	A genome-wide approach to children's aggressive behavior: The EAGLE consortium.	Individual differences in aggressive behavior emerge in early childhood and predict persisting behavioral problems and disorders. Studies of antisocial and severe aggression in adulthood indicate substantial underlying biology. However, little attention has been given to genome-wide approaches of aggressive behavior in children. We analyzed data from nine population-based studies and assessed aggressive behavior using well-validated parent-reported questionnaires. This is the largest sample exploring children's aggressive behavior to date (N = 18,988), with measures in two developmental stages (N = 15,668 early childhood and N = 16,311 middle childhood/early adolescence). First, we estimated the additive genetic variance of children's aggressive behavior based on genome-wide SNP information, using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). Second, genetic associations within each study were assessed using a quasi-Poisson regression approach, capturing the highly right-skewed distribution of aggressive behavior. Third, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide associations for both the total age-mixed sample and the two developmental stages. Finally, we performed a gene-based test using the summary statistics of the total sample. GCTA quantified variance tagged by common SNPs (10-54%). The meta-analysis of the total sample identified one region in chromosome 2 (2p12) at near genome-wide significance (top SNP rs11126630, P = 5.30 × 10(-8) ). The separate meta-analyses of the two developmental stages revealed suggestive evidence of association at the same locus. The gene-based analysis indicated association of variation within AVPR1A with aggressive behavior. We conclude that common variants at 2p12 show suggestive evidence for association with childhood aggression. Replication of these initial findings is needed, and further studies should clarify its biological meaning. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the context of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) over 20 genes have been identified but, aside APOE, all show small effect sizes, leaving a large part of the genetic component unexplained. Admixed populations, such as Caribbean Hispanics, can provide a valuable contribution because of their unique genetic profile and higher incidence of the disease.

We identified three newly associated regions: 17q25.1 (LINC00673, rs11655237, odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.34, P = 1.42 × 10(-14)), 7p13 (SUGCT, rs17688601, OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.92, P = 1.41 × 10(-8)) and 3q29 (TP63, rs9854771, OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85-0.93, P = 2.35 × 10(-8)). We detected significant association at 2p13.3 (ETAA1, rs1486134, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-1.19, P = 3.36 × 10(-9)), a region with previous suggestive evidence in Han Chinese. We replicated previously reported associations at 9q34.2 (ABO), 13q22.1 (KLF5), 5p15.33 (TERT and CLPTM1), 13q12.2 (PDX1), 1q32.1 (NR5A2), 7q32.3 (LINC-PINT), 16q23.1 (BCAR1) and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3).

26098866	Loss-of-function variants in ATM confer risk of gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer is a serious health problem worldwide, with particularly high prevalence in eastern Asia. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Asian populations have identified several loci that associate with gastric cancer risk. Here we report a GWAS of gastric cancer in a European population, using information on 2,500 population-based gastric cancer cases and 205,652 controls. We found a new gastric cancer association with loss-of-function mutations in ATM (gene test, P = 8.0 × 10(-12); odds ratio (OR) = 4.74). The combination of the loss-of-function variants p.Gln852*, p.Ser644* and p.Tyr103* (combined minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.3%) also associates with pancreatic and prostate cancers (OR = 3.81 and 2.18, respectively) and gives an indication of risk of breast and colorectal cancers (OR = 1.82 and 1.97, respectively). Cancers in those carrying loss-of-function ATM mutations are diagnosed at a significantly earlier age than in non-carriers. Our results confirm an association between gastric cancer in Europeans and three loci previously reported in Asians, MUC1, PRKAA1 and PSCA, refine the association signal at PRKAA1 and support a pathogenic role for the tandem repeat identified in MUC1. 	 25220842 19924550 11315092 19165921 21681742 22974093 10817650 25807286 23639638 21896770 20661439 20729852 20644199 22585167 22086963 21070776 20080505 18488030 15928302 21070779 21478889 23715323 24507775 23103227 22805490 22037551 19238635 24336170 6610488 20562413 16832357 20016592 9076520 17406355 22121212 25157153
26116289	Genetic determinants of swallowing impairments among community dwelling older population.	Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) affect a significant proportion of community dwelling older individuals, being more prevalent in age-associated neurological conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. The genetic determinants of dysphagia are still being explored and have largely been studied through candidate gene analysis approaches. The aim of the study was to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of common genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and self-reported swallowing impairments in a longitudinal cohort of community dwelling older adults.	
26105758	A genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci for variation in human ear morphology.	Here we report a genome-wide association study for non-pathological pinna morphology in over 5,000 Latin Americans. We find genome-wide significant association at seven genomic regions affecting: lobe size and attachment, folding of antihelix, helix rolling, ear protrusion and antitragus size (linear regression P values 2 × 10(-8) to 3 × 10(-14)). Four traits are associated with a functional variant in the Ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) gene, a key regulator of embryonic skin appendage development. We confirm expression of Edar in the developing mouse ear and that Edar-deficient mice have an abnormally shaped pinna. Two traits are associated with SNPs in a region overlapping the T-Box Protein 15 (TBX15) gene, a major determinant of mouse skeletal development. Strongest association in this region is observed for SNP rs17023457 located in an evolutionarily conserved binding site for the transcription factor Cartilage paired-class homeoprotein 1 (CART1), and we confirm that rs17023457 alters in vitro binding of CART1. 	 9847249 18839484 13654621 20616382 20711176 20634204 20447883 21167468 21189481 21429143 21892150 22567092 22648185 22840281 23217325 23415220 23793515 24067355 24475213 18561327 19068278 19166470 19343178 19356871 19543368 19681132 19648217 19804850 20025067 11780064 12794488 14737183 15470672 24880027 25254375 15297300 15652702 15797017 15962237 16552732 17701901 18065779 18391950 18391951 18493316 18704500 10431241
26121033	Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Hearing Threshold Shift in Subjects during First Encounter with Occupational Impulse Noise.	Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most significant occupational health issue worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with hearing threshold shift in young males undergoing their first encounter with occupational impulse noise. We report a significant association of SNP rs7598759 (p < 5 x 10(-7); p = 0.01 after permutation and correction; Odds Ratio = 12.75) in the gene coding for nucleolin, a multifunctional phosphoprotein involved in the control of senescence and protection against apoptosis. Interestingly, nucleolin has been shown to mediate the anti-apoptotic effect of HSP70, a protein found to prevent ototoxicity and whose polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to NIHL. Increase in nucleolin expression has also been associated with the prevention of apoptosis in cells undergoing oxidative stress, a well-known metabolic sequela of noise exposure. To assess the potential role of nucleolin in hearing loss, we tested down-regulation of nucleolin in cochlear sensory cells HEI-OC1 under oxidative stress conditions and report increased sensitivity to cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug with ototoxic side effects. Additional SNPs were found with suggestive association (p < 5 x 10(-4)), of which 7 SNPs were located in genes previously reported to be related to NIHL and 43 of them were observed in 36 other genes previously not reported to be associated with NIHL. Taken together, our GWAS data and in vitro studies reported herein suggest that nucleolin is a potential candidate associated with NIHL in this population.	 22547603 23941878 16823764 18974171 19145477 20714140 12138209 24662628 20050922 23821348 19643173 24183105 21085122 21519324 21320988 23128226 22982688 20026135 16255080 21493956 23132386 22433872 24472721 11252765 24497307 19523148 19815857 14592418 20933124 21875658 10036227 19671677 21782914 15345661 16415888 24414257 15188275 23060615 20885443 21468356 19906956 18790034 19880028 23447610 19816507 22922572 24614528 21118128 23716673 19183343 24652947 23739996 21923633 23246618 23296212 19757191 16239267 22147606 22617883 19925854 16446561 12811000 20553303 24442868 17701901 18776909 17699675 17009596 19684145 16429448 20512162 21173489 21980556 20074974 23361190 24397911 23207014 23628789 19646187 17567781 22575206 21960124 22885407 23924083 16213212 18813331 22240535 16299704 22712683 20812880

26207136	CDH13 and HCRTR2 May Be Associated with Hypersomnia Symptom of Bipolar Depression: A Genome-Wide Functional Enrichment Pathway Analysis.	Although bipolar disorder is highly heritable, the identification of specific genetic variations is limited because of the complex traits underlying the disorder. We performed a genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder using a subphenotype that shows hypersomnia symptom during a major depressive episode. We investigated a total of 2,191 cases, 1,434 controls, and 703,012 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the merged samples obtained from the Translational Genomics Institute and the Genetic Association Information Network. The gene emerging as the most significant by statistical analysis was rs1553441 (odds ratio=0.4093; p=1.20×10(-5); Permuted p=6.0×10(-6)). However, the 5×0(-8) threshold for statistical significance required in a genome-wide association study was not achieved. The functional enrichment pathway analysis showed significant enrichments in the adhesion, development-related, synaptic transmission-related, and cell recognition-related pathways. For further evaluation, each gene of the enriched pathways was reviewed and matched with genes that were suggested to be associated with psychiatric disorders by previous genetic studies. We found that the cadherin 13 and hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 genes may be involved in the hypersomnia symptom during a major depressive episode of bipolar disorder. 	 22813971 18024171 19801833 18354010 19566795 11249805 8878318 22626650 17590434 22710065 16973279 19581569 18952152 15836615 11305713 17761380 20876611 20516154 10775799 8878312 19033363 19009022 9491897 17099884 17466285 20800221 9822755 18657247 22952603 23657787 22064162 20235792 21738484 8801636 20798882 19166596 20887962 10737605 21818250 17485606 21811085 17701901 667233 7944874 17064432 22384149 19131956 10904433 11682267 12788878 21377495 17486107 19543373 22633396 19488044 16175504 23419545

26151496	Genetic determinants of antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis by human leukocyte antigen genotyping and genome-wide association study.	Graves' disease is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism affecting 1.0-1.6% of the population. Antithyroid drugs are the treatment cornerstone, but may cause life-threatening agranulocytosis. Here we conduct a two-stage association study on two separate subject sets (in total 42 agranulocytosis cases and 1,208 Graves' disease controls), using direct human leukocyte antigen genotyping and SNP-based genome-wide association study. We demonstrate HLA-B*38:02 (Armitage trend Pcombined=6.75 × 10(-32)) and HLA-DRB1*08:03 (Pcombined=1.83 × 10(-9)) as independent susceptibility loci. The genome-wide association study identifies the same signals. Estimated odds ratios for these two loci comparing effective allele carriers to non-carriers are 21.48 (95% confidence interval=11.13-41.48) and 6.13 (95% confidence interval=3.28-11.46), respectively. Carrying both HLA-B*38:02 and HLA-DRB1*08:03 increases odds ratio to 48.41 (Pcombined=3.32 × 10(-21), 95% confidence interval=21.66-108.22). Our results could be useful for antithyroid-induced agranulocytosis and potentially for agranulocytosis caused by other chemicals. 	 11943262 18450018 25070946 11071676 21570397 16981200 19399780 8602707 21062830 15116359 11336680 22920398 2222133 21912932 24698974 12140742 14630763 7620171 10974135 15057820 15215472 15745981 21712934 17760275 21841780 15264254 24297345 11867360 23762245 15242574 20360767 21307958 21428770 9587740 9281381 7249508 18428767 24057289 11888582 23199282 21932857 17470834 16231289 21167468 21245432 11072960 21149285 598014 18681784 10627862
26184321	Heritability and Genome-Wide Association Studies for Hair Color in a Dutch Twin Family Based Sample.	Hair color is one of the most visible and heritable traits in humans. Here, we estimated heritability by structural equation modeling (N = 20,142), and performed a genome wide association (GWA) analysis (N = 7091) and a GCTA study (N = 3340) on hair color within a large cohort of twins, their parents and siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). Self-reported hair color was analyzed as five binary phenotypes, namely "blond versus non-blond", "red versus non-red", "brown versus non-brown", "black versus non-black", and "light versus dark". The broad-sense heritability of hair color was estimated between 73% and 99% and the genetic component included non-additive genetic variance. Assortative mating for hair color was significant, except for red and black hair color. From GCTA analyses, at most 24.6% of the additive genetic variance in hair color was explained by 1000G well-imputed SNPs. Genome-wide association analysis for each hair color showed that SNPs in the MC1R region were significantly associated with red, brown and black hair, and also with light versus dark hair color. Five other known genes (HERC2, TPCN2, SLC24A4, IRF4, and KITLG) gave genome-wide significant hits for blond, brown and light versus dark hair color. We did not find and replicate any new loci for hair color. 	 16514473 18483556 17194218 22234890 17254420 23123854 16825562 17952075 23258944 24880339 12379639 7945153 14996086 20585627 17358008 22820512 16463023 1645473 12415317 14970286 12851335 18528436 18488028 18426404 23531865 21197618 23010199 18366057 23587773 24916646 623434 17701901 23074066 11454772 18348202 21167468 20381640 1094469 7641926 17943131
26174813	New suggestive genetic loci and biological pathways for attention function in adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	Attention deficit is one of the core symptoms of the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the specific genetic variants that may be associated with attention function in adult ADHD remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to identifying SNPs associated with attention function in adult ADHD and tested whether these associations were enriched for specific biological pathways. Commissions, hit-reaction time (HRT), the standard error of HRT (HRTSE), and intraindividual coefficient variability (ICV) of the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II) were assessed in 479 unmedicated adult ADHD individuals. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) was conducted for each outcome and, subsequently, gene set enrichment analyses were performed. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P < 5E-08), 27 loci showed suggestive evidence of association with the CPT outcomes (P < E-05). The most relevant associated SNP was located in the SORCS2 gene (P = 3.65E-07), previously associated with bipolar disorder (BP), Alzheimer disease (AD), and brain structure in elderly individuals. We detected other genes suggested to be involved in synaptic plasticity, cognitive function, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, and smoking behavior such as NUAK1, FGF20, NETO1, BTBD9, DLG2, TOP3B, and CHRNB4. Also, several of the pathways nominally associated with the CPT outcomes are relevant for ADHD such as the ubiquitin proteasome, neurodegenerative disorders, axon guidance, and AD amyloid secretase pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS and pathway analysis of attention function in patients with persistent ADHD. Overall, our findings reinforce the conceptualization of attention function as a potential endophenotype for studying the molecular basis of adult ADHD. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

26169577	A genome-wide association study identifies variants in KCNIP4 associated with ACE inhibitor-induced cough.	The most common side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) drugs is cough. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ACEi-induced cough among 7080 subjects of diverse ancestries in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. Cases were subjects diagnosed with ACEi-induced cough. Controls were subjects with at least 6 months of ACEi use and no cough. A GWAS (1595 cases and 5485 controls) identified associations on chromosome 4 in an intron of KCNIP4. The strongest association was at rs145489027 (minor allele frequency=0.33, odds ratio (OR)=1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.4), P=1.0 × 10(-8)). Replication for six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNIP4 was tested in a second eMERGE population (n=926) and in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside, Scotland (GoDARTS) cohort (n=4309). Replication was observed at rs7675300 (OR=1.32 (1.01-1.70), P=0.04) in eMERGE and at rs16870989 and rs1495509 (OR=1.15 (1.01-1.30), P=0.03 for both) in GoDARTS. The combined association at rs1495509 was significant (OR=1.23 (1.15-1.32), P=1.9 × 10(-9)). These results indicate that SNPs in KCNIP4 may modulate ACEi-induced cough risk.	 23304330 22723835 23394388 19583679 11699055 17194218 10835412 24786321 22125226 7619667 15363885 21735171 21052031 24987407 22064851 23743551 17572673 635089 12522467 10904024 8953504 12829703 8673930 11847232 24743543 23457522 24642470 8862965 16112838 11217909 25566314 20733501 23715323 7905161 23334152 18500243 12402502 11037314 21832968 18358317 21624954 20509871 20634204 8562296 17701901 9535416 23269371 24646999 21508311 23257181 19543373 23937567 19744011
26174136	Three missense variants of metabolic syndrome-related genes are associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin levels.	Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) encoded by SERPINA1 is an acute-phase inflammation marker, and AAT deficiency (AATD) is known as one of the common genetic disorders in European populations. However, no genetic determinants to AAT levels apart from the SERPINA gene clusters have been identified to date. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of serum AAT levels followed by a two-staged replication study recruiting a total of 9,359 Japanese community-dwelling population. Three missense variants of metabolic syndrome-related genes, namely, rs671 in ALDH2, rs1169288 in HNF1A and rs1260326 in GCKR, significantly associate with AAT levels (P≤1.5 × 10(-12)). Previous reports have shown the functional relevance of ALDH2 and HNF1A to AAT. We observe a significant interaction of rs671 and alcohol consumption on AAT levels. We confirm the association between AAT and rs2896268 in SERPINA1, which is independent of known causative variants of AATD. These findings would support various AAT functions including metabolic processes. 	 22965072 10468604 15685488 11315092 21372407 18439253 16862161 18515255 6602546 18700811 19643913 18439548 23826141 6117742 22064851 8033502 16325697 3876766 8060517 22171074 8244391 18504548 23305565 14015517 11375898 14522813 2024727 1608473 1560668 12401749 18332101 20354512 24037726 15297300 23697560 19867196 17463248 23990791 6804874 23800943 1351206 25084704 17701901 11466099 22697349 20981092 24956270 5007912 10733371 9971870 20031592 23832694 15983043
26184070	Gene-set and multivariate genome-wide association analysis of oppositional defiant behavior subtypes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a frequent psychiatric disorder seen in children and adolescents with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ODD is also a common antecedent to both affective disorders and aggressive behaviors. Although the heritability of ODD has been estimated to be around 0.60, there has been little research into the molecular genetics of ODD. The present study examined the association of irritable and defiant/vindictive dimensions and categorical subtypes of ODD (based on latent class analyses) with previously described specific polymorphisms (DRD4 exon3 VNTR, 5-HTTLPR, and seven OXTR SNPs) as well as with dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin genes and pathways in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with ADHD. In addition, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the aforementioned ODD dimensions and subtypes. Apart from adjusting the analyses for age and sex, we controlled for "parental ability to cope with disruptive behavior." None of the hypothesis-driven analyses revealed a significant association with ODD dimensions and subtypes. Inadequate parenting behavior was significantly associated with all ODD dimensions and subtypes, most strongly with defiant/vindictive behaviors. In addition, the GWAS did not result in genome-wide significant findings but bioinformatics and literature analyses revealed that the proteins encoded by 28 of the 53 top-ranked genes functionally interact in a molecular landscape centered around Beta-catenin signaling and involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of ODD and inform future genetic studies of oppositional behavior. © 2015 The Authors.

26183928	Implication of a Chromosome 15q15.2 Locus in Regulating UBR1 and Predisposing Smokers to MGMT Methylation in Lung.	O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that protects cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents; however, MGMT is silenced by promoter hypermethylation during carcinogenesis. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an enhancer in the MGMT promoter was previously identified to be highly significantly associated with risk for MGMT methylation in lung cancer and sputum from smokers. To further genetic investigations, a genome-wide association and replication study was conducted in two smoker cohorts to identify novel loci for MGMT methylation in sputum that were independent of the MGMT enhancer polymorphism. Two novel trans-acting loci (15q15.2 and 17q24.3) that were identified acted together with the enhancer SNP to empower risk prediction for MGMT methylation. We found that the predisposition to MGMT methylation arising from the 15q15.2 locus involved regulation of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component UBR1. UBR1 attenuation reduced turnover of MGMT protein and increased repair of O6-methylguanine in nitrosomethylurea-treated human bronchial epithelial cells, while also reducing MGMT promoter activity and abolishing MGMT induction. Overall, our results substantiate reduced gene transcription as a major mechanism for predisposition to MGMT methylation in the lungs of smokers, and support the importance of UBR1 in regulating MGMT homeostasis and DNA repair of alkylated DNA adducts in cells.	 8033092 1893528 24009515 21076411 20627446 21355081 21466232 22228633 22322129 22684628 22975219 23431366 8573590 8968045 9192819 10029064 15604268 16540689 17621591 18568024 18632608 18725933 19164530 19540355 19734844 19997073 20159108 20159110 20215007 20485568 24071855 24032348 24572595 24628573 24703846 24767943 10811111 12503076 12941804 15343277 3180342 1875945 23908385

26190474	Performance of genetic risk factors in prediction of trichloroethylene induced hypersensitivity syndrome.	Trichloroethylene induced hypersensitivity syndrome is dose-independent and potentially life threatening disease, which has become one of the serious occupational health issues and requires intensive treatment. To discover the genetic risk factors and evaluate the performance of risk prediction model for the disease, we conducted genomewide association study and replication study with total of 174 cases and 1761 trichloroethylene-tolerant controls. Fifty seven SNPs that exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) were screened to relate with the disease, among which two independent SNPs were identified, that is rs2857281 at MICA (odds ratio, 11.92; P meta = 1.33 × 10(-37)) and rs2523557 between HLA-B and MICA (odds ratio, 7.33; P meta = 8.79 × 10(-35)). The genetic risk score with these two SNPs explains at least 20.9% of the disease variance and up to 32.5-fold variation in inter-individual risk. Combining of two SNPs as predictors for the disease would have accuracy of 80.73%, the area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) scores was 0.82 with sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 85%, which was considered to have excellent discrimination for the disease, and could be considered for translational application for screening employees before exposure.	 19323961 16109824 19479009 10899738 19816555 23128226 10852497 17106739 21345260 15849067 3287615 11224526 21778616 18602338 23928230 20407216 24771349 7063747 2673291 23323277 23774735 19178412 19895570 18540116 14605423 20479774 18007983 17179634 11169245 23881057 24748926 17701901 21342224 19834256 23439055 9433871 17077186 10440244
26192919	Association analyses identify 38 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease and highlight shared genetic risk across populations.	Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we report the first trans-ancestry association study of IBD, with genome-wide or Immunochip genotype data from an extended cohort of 86,640 European individuals and Immunochip data from 9,846 individuals of East Asian, Indian or Iranian descent. We implicate 38 loci in IBD risk for the first time. For the majority of the IBD risk loci, the direction and magnitude of effect are consistent in European and non-European cohorts. Nevertheless, we observe genetic heterogeneity between divergent populations at several established risk loci driven by differences in allele frequency (NOD2) or effect size (TNFSF15 and ATG16L1) or a combination of these factors (IL23R and IRGM). Our results provide biological insights into the pathogenesis of IBD and demonstrate the usefulness of trans-ancestry association studies for mapping loci associated with complex diseases and understanding genetic architecture across diverse populations. 	 21699788 23266558 24710357 21526222 24837172 16862161 12111919 22384356 21267062 21374718 22764736 22138821 22500001 22125221 21999944 12499305 19692703 24244565 23128233 21249183 11254498 20383124 12486105 20507892 20686565 21267061 22843982 21304977 12958120 24390342 17435756 21983784 23583432 19557189 21829388 24509480 23547114 19915573 22187483 15052270 22736794 24740359 17701901 20126254 22479202 14997037 22001864 6733226 23850713 14515278 20876105 24068945 24013639 22914050
26194203	Genome-Wide Association Study of Down Syndrome-Associated Atrioventricular Septal Defects.	The goal of this study was to identify the contribution of common genetic variants to Down syndrome-associated atrioventricular septal defect, a severe heart abnormality. Compared with the euploid population, infants with Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, have a 2000-fold increased risk of presenting with atrioventricular septal defects. The cause of this increased risk remains elusive. Here we present data from the largest heart study conducted to date on a trisomic background by using a carefully characterized collection of individuals from extreme ends of the phenotypic spectrum. We performed a genome-wide association study using logistic regression analysis on 452 individuals with Down syndrome, consisting of 210 cases with complete atrioventricular septal defects and 242 controls with structurally normal hearts. No individual variant achieved genome-wide significance. We identified four disomic regions (1p36.3, 5p15.31, 8q22.3, and 17q22) and two trisomic regions on chromosome 21 (around PDXK and KCNJ6 genes) that merit further investigation in large replication studies. Our data show that a few common genetic variants of large effect size (odds ratio >2.0) do not account for the elevated risk of Down syndrome-associated atrioventricular septal defects. Instead, multiple variants of low-to-moderate effect sizes may contribute to this elevated risk, highlighting the complex genetic architecture of atrioventricular septal defects even in the highly susceptible Down syndrome population. 	 21653639 23040494 23319885 23243023 23410880 22976198 23297363 23705960 23727699 23665959 23708190 23708191 23783273 24217047 24594544 24702954 24800985 24362460 25036032 25515806 25807483 25341113 2521249 8222143 8021024 9651244 9843040 10430586 15749193 15611048 16862161 17208216 17519398 17538014 17701901 17903304 17955020 18263841 18344706 18303085 18657826 18826959 18955134 19571179 19597493 19961844 20718043 20634204 21555462 21550244 21987466 21442329 21728077 22194017 22407241 22552340 22550138 22523272 22912673 22904188 22939634 23020118 22902904 23193274 25572405 10990458 11352887 11707601 11854326 11972155 12084585 12632326 12584197 12845333 14534590 14703791 15234422 15342840 7253006 6824534
26198764	Genome-wide association study of schizophrenia in Ashkenazi Jews.	Schizophrenia is a common, clinically heterogeneous disorder associated with lifelong morbidity and early mortality. Several genetic variants associated with schizophrenia have been identified, but the majority of the heritability remains unknown. In this study, we report on a case-control sample of Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), a founder population that may provide additional insights into genetic etiology of schizophrenia. We performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of 592 cases and 505 controls of AJ ancestry ascertained in the US. Subsequently, we performed a meta-analysis with an Israeli AJ sample of 913 cases and 1640 controls, followed by a meta-analysis and polygenic risk scoring using summary results from Psychiatric GWAS Consortium 2 schizophrenia study. The U.S. AJ sample showed strong evidence of polygenic inheritance (pseudo-R(2) ∼9.7%) and a SNP-heritability estimate of 0.39 (P = 0.00046). We found no genome-wide significant associations in the U.S. sample or in the combined US/Israeli AJ meta-analysis of 1505 cases and 2145 controls. The strongest AJ specific associations (P-values in 10(-6) -10(-7) range) were in the 22q 11.2 deletion region and included the genes TBX1, GLN1, and COMT. Supportive evidence (meta P < 1 × 10(-4) ) was also found for several previously identified genome-wide significant findings, including the HLA region, CNTN4, IMMP2L, and GRIN2A. The meta-analysis of the U.S. sample with the PGC2 results provided initial genome-wide significant evidence for six new loci. Among the novel potential susceptibility genes is PEPD, a gene involved in proline metabolism, which is associated with a Mendelian disorder characterized by developmental delay and cognitive deficits.	
26198393	Genome-wide association study identifies variants at 16p13 associated with survival in multiple myeloma patients.	Here we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiple myeloma (MM) survival. In a meta-analysis of 306 MM patients treated at UCSF and 239 patients treated at the Mayo clinic, we find a significant association between SNPs near the gene FOPNL on chromosome 16p13 and survival (rs72773978; P=6 × 10(-10)). Patients with the minor allele are at increased risk for mortality (HR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.94-3.58) relative to patients homozygous for the major allele. We replicate the association in the IMMEnSE cohort including 772 patients, and a University of Utah cohort including 318 patients (rs72773978 P=0.044). Using publicly available data, we find that the minor allele was associated with increased expression of FOPNL and increased expression of FOPNL was associated with higher expression of centrosomal genes and with shorter survival. Polymorphisms at the FOPNL locus are associated with survival among MM patients. 	 18182586 10626152 19200528 19543373 20551181 20616382 20634204 20702402 20574050 21118971 21430775 22120009 18006703 17194218 10723588 11861292 12393520 12576322 12780789 10414909 16373658 16728703 17024118 17023574 22159523 22142827 22234687 22232737 22180457 22354002 22689647 22761710 22941192 22684628 22942257 23128226 22718349 23315928 23502783 23644492 23180869 17357068
26211971	A Functional SNP in BNC2 Is Associated with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformity. We previously conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and detected two loci associated with AIS. To identify additional loci, we extended our GWAS by increasing the number of cohorts (2,109 affected subjects and 11,140 control subjects in total) and conducting a whole-genome imputation. Through the extended GWAS and replication studies using independent Japanese and Chinese populations, we identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 9p22.2 (p = 2.46 × 10(-13); odds ratio = 1.21). The most significantly associated SNPs were in intron 3 of BNC2, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, basonuclin-2. Expression quantitative trait loci data suggested that the associated SNPs have the potential to regulate the BNC2 transcriptional activity and that the susceptibility alleles increase BNC2 expression. We identified a functional SNP, rs10738445 in BNC2, whose susceptibility allele showed both higher binding to a transcription factor, YY1 (yin and yang 1), and higher BNC2 enhancer activity than the non-susceptibility allele. BNC2 overexpression produced body curvature in developing zebrafish in a gene-dosage-dependent manner. Our results suggest that increased BNC2 expression is implicated in the etiology of AIS.	 22362628 10635522 23096252 23666238 24721834 25064007 25283277 21293892 12923522 14681366 14988505 15081112 4767654 17937395 17982410 19706529 19956727 20425822 20702402 22019779 22301463 20870008 25784220 21308753 10564832 22797724
26219847	Heritability and Genome-Wide Association Analyses of Human Gait Suggest Contribution of Common Variants.	Human gait is a complex neurological and musculoskeletal function, of which the genetic basis remains largely unknown. To determine the influence of common genetic variants on gait parameters, we studied 2,946 participants of the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort of unrelated elderly individuals. We assessed 30 gait parameters using an electronic walkway, which yielded seven independent gait domains after principal component analysis. Genotypes of participants were imputed to the 1,000 Genomes reference panel for generating genetic relationship matrices to estimate heritability of gait parameters, and for subsequent genome-wide association scans (GWASs) to identify specific variants. Gait domains with the highest age- and sex-adjusted heritability were Variability (h (2) = 61%), Rhythm (37%), and Tandem (32%). For other gait domains, heritability estimates attenuated after adjustment for height and weight. Genome-wide association scans identified a variant on 1p22.3 that was significantly associated with single support time, a variable from the Rhythm domain (rs72953990; N = 2,946; β [SE] = 0.0069 (0.0012), p = 2.30×10(-8)). This variant did not replicate in an independent sample (N = 362; p = .78). In conclusion, human gait has highly heritable components that are explained by common genetic variation, which are partly attributed to height and weight. Collaborative efforts are needed to identify robust single variant associations for the heritable parameters.	 24097064 18627552 22003128 12535728 17077203 21552263 2230833 20881960 16282563 20616382 20935630 14980558 18927448 21205966 21826061 23018028 21167468 9063277 23849591 11410174
26222057	Genome Wide Association Study for Predictors of Progression Free Survival in Patients on Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Bevacizumab and Cetuximab in First-Line Therapy of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.	Despite expanding options for systemic treatment, survival for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains limited and individual response is difficult to predict. In search of pre-treatment predictors, pharmacogenetic research has mainly used a candidate gene approach. Genome wide association (GWA) studies offer the benefit of simultaneously analyzing a large number of SNPs, in both known and still unidentified functional regions. Using a GWA approach, we searched for genetic markers affecting progression free survival (PFS) in mCRC patients treated with first-line capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (CAPOX-B), with or without cetuximab.	 15688387 17375050 17488527 17554300 17554337 17612493 17664471 17656095 17701901 21848897 18086000 18202412 17998284 18300295 18650507 11943784 12941428 14578472 15652477 18974965 18718904 19196673 19536109 20363836 20085586 20585100 21239504 21048041 22315053 22055112 23300701 23335087 23266556 23375517 22310351 24024839 25280443
26227905	A Pooling Genome-Wide Association Study Combining a Pathway Analysis for Typical Sporadic Parkinson's Disease in the Han Population of Chinese Mainland.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) are mainly conducted in European and American populations at present, and the Han populations of Chinese mainland (HPCM) almost have not been studied yet. Here, we conducted a pooling GWAS combining a pathway analysis with 862,198 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms of IlluminaHumanOmniZhongHua-8 in 250 sPD and 250 controls from HPCM precluded toxicant exposure, age, and heavy coffee drinking habit interference.

The 40 genes were shared by at least two pathways. The most possible associated pathways with sPD were axon guidance, ECM-receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, tight junction, focal adhesion, gap junction, long-term depression, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, adherens junction, endocytosis, and protein digestion and absorption. Our results indicated that these loci, pathways, and their related genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of sPD from HPCM and provided some novel evidences for further searching the genetic pathogenesis of sPD.	 18985386 19621416 1564476 21364952 24719383 23472874 23088494 19008252 17159887 18215617 22237490 19525687 22608559 22482450 12020974 12801647 19457088 19915575 17966091 15026468 22563296 18462474 19584899 17327425 15668963 17409722 17337120 22309736 20711177 9754903 12802337 12666098 25124148 21044948 21738488 10998054 21084426 20070850 21292315 17437543 21542908 16336966 19162339 18808450 21970630 22023386 24648008 22408597 1287728 15677381 21204026 22138181 19305504 21790809 21248740 19915576
26237428	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies five new susceptibility loci for cutaneous malignant melanoma.	Thirteen common susceptibility loci have been reproducibly associated with cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). We report the results of an international 2-stage meta-analysis of CMM genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This meta-analysis combines 11 GWAS (5 previously unpublished) and a further three stage 2 data sets, totaling 15,990 CMM cases and 26,409 controls. Five loci not previously associated with CMM risk reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)), as did 2 previously reported but unreplicated loci and all 13 established loci. Newly associated SNPs fall within putative melanocyte regulatory elements, and bioinformatic and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data highlight candidate genes in the associated regions, including one involved in telomere biology. 	 7741123 8664138 9034193 9097971 15837981 15761869 16029848 15935701 20517342 21451362 21637794 21653522 21983785 21983787 21926416 22064851 21706340 21993562 22426310 22143225 22523397 22723415 22561558 22820512 18852200 18792098 18668136 19170031 19151717 19543373 19578364 19578365 19715440 19854130 19770375 20509871 20602913 20570912 20647408 20580718 20584901 20634204 20629177 20944595 20981092 21058334 21304890 21116649 21084183 23537197 23990928 24210251 24267888 24343338 24686846 24686849 16436506 16862161 17145863 17236130 17572673 17627017 17701901 24495407 25231748 22955989 22955616 22941192 23001925 22709892 23048041 23535734 23455637 23540573 23715323 23548203 17952075 18483556 18462017 18488026 18488027 25077817 25407435 25954001 12045153 12111919 12592373 3802833 1869281 1763056 8168482 7741122
26237429	A coding variant in RARG confers susceptibility to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer.	Anthracyclines are used in over 50% of childhood cancer treatment protocols, but their clinical usefulness is limited by anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) manifesting as asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction and congestive heart failure in up to 57% and 16% of patients, respectively. Candidate gene studies have reported genetic associations with ACT, but these studies have in general lacked robust patient numbers, independent replication or functional validation. Thus, the individual variability in ACT susceptibility remains largely unexplained. We performed a genome-wide association study in 280 patients of European ancestry treated for childhood cancer, with independent replication in similarly treated cohorts of 96 European and 80 non-European patients. We identified a nonsynonymous variant (rs2229774, p.Ser427Leu) in RARG highly associated with ACT (P = 5.9 × 10(-8), odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 4.7 (2.7-8.3)). This variant alters RARG function, leading to derepression of the key ACT genetic determinant Top2b, and provides new insight into the pathophysiology of this severe adverse drug reaction. 	 18301416 22809260 11315092 23104132 15494319 17516870 19884340 19996459 22124095 20587042 21900104 11101737 26230641 16234524 20974500 21887680 9193351 24316577 24470002 23182048 11134212 17875725 19448608 14977278 23028599 1997853 17545624 18347383 15297300 24259388 21929509 19863340 18457324 20621839 23927520 3411343 15169927 22473161 16330681 22008047 23999848 15614783 17924348 23001242 7760889 23154571 23576480 20634204 16170171 8801176 23539596 20660845 23183705 23861158 21940749 19652663 23441093 24273552
26239289	Evidence of CNIH3 involvement in opioid dependence.	Opioid dependence, a severe addictive disorder and major societal problem, has been demonstrated to be moderately heritable. We conducted a genome-wide association study in Comorbidity and Trauma Study data comparing opioid-dependent daily injectors (N=1167) with opioid misusers who never progressed to daily injection (N=161). The strongest associations, observed for CNIH3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were confirmed in two independent samples, the Yale-Penn genetic studies of opioid, cocaine and alcohol dependence and the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment, which both contain non-dependent opioid misusers and opioid-dependent individuals. Meta-analyses found five genome-wide significant CNIH3 SNPs. The A allele of rs10799590, the most highly associated SNP, was robustly protective (P=4.30E-9; odds ratio 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.55-0.74)). Epigenetic annotation predicts that this SNP is functional in fetal brain. Neuroimaging data from the Duke Neurogenetics Study (N=312) provide evidence of this SNP's in vivo functionality; rs10799590 A allele carriers displayed significantly greater right amygdala habituation to threat-related facial expressions, a phenotype associated with resilience to psychopathology. Computational genetic analyses of physical dependence on morphine across 23 mouse strains yielded significant correlations for haplotypes in CNIH3 and functionally related genes. These convergent findings support CNIH3 involvement in the pathophysiology of opioid dependence, complementing prior studies implicating the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate system. 	 24884839 20418890 20602913 19214139 25086606 25186755 17194218 23661099 21374718 21968928 22072679 20963825 25690851 9819065 22002768 9819064 23197736 24143882 8189735 22500942 20418888 20616382 25242221 11194736 12668357 22127213 21284036 23522044 17382831 23715323 23303482 22118772 23345231 18385739 23629413 22688188 20202923 17506155 17554300 24166409 19160503 23958962 20833480 17135278 22225671 25284303 20418889 15713226 17701901 22292017 22694982 18046303 16219906 22806211 21126734 22675452 22815494 24853943
26629533	A Genome-wide Association Study Provides Evidence of Sex-specific Involvement of Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20-TLR12P) and Chr8p23.1 (HMGB1P46) With Diabetic Neuropathic Pain.	Neuropathic pain is defined as pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or a disease affecting the somatosensory system and it affects around 1 in 4 diabetic patients in the UK. The purpose of this genome-wide association study (GWAS) was to identify genetic contributors to this disorder. Cases of neuropathic pain were defined as diabetic patients with a multiple prescription history of at least one of five drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Controls were diabetic individuals who were not prescribed any of these drugs, nor amitriptyline, carbamazepine, or nortriptyline. Overall, 961 diabetic neuropathic pain cases and 3260 diabetic controls in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside (GoDARTS) cohort were identified. We found a cluster in the Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20-TLR12P) with a lowest P value of 2.74 × 10(- 7) at rs71647933 in females and a cluster in the Chr8p23.1, next to HMGB1P46 with a lowest P value of 8.02 × 10(- 7) at rs6986153 in males. Sex-specific narrow sense heritability was higher in males (30.0%) than in females (14.7%). This GWAS on diabetic neuropathic pain provides evidence for the sex-specific involvement of Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20-TLR12P) and Chr8p23.1 (HMGB1P46) with the disorder, indicating the need for further research.	 17058631 15979797 23570317 24909733 22643932 22956598 24291734 17670804 15809417 21852677 20392563 20975707 18615568 15772909 24533460 16443884 16887967 20851519 22138821 22696371 18460194 20688780 15673800 17714116 15526234 21376301 16415888 22824385 20402746 15297300 18439759 16801572 23996692 23991202 19295157 23199373 17140732 24582949 21764514 16618472 19853529 20634204 23616109 17701901 23442783 22127462 16878026 20705215 23241283 23395730 12527760 21186350 23246311 23568774 17355971 12663858 19543373 15777864 23183491 24974787 23485369 22466124
26242244	Association of chromosome 5q21.3 polymorphisms with the exploratory eye movement dysfunction in schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia patients show abnormalities in many eye movement tasks. Among them, exploratory eye movements (EEM) dysfunction seems to be specific to schizophrenia. However the mechanism of EEM disturbances in schizophrenia patients remains elusive. We investigate the relationship between EEM and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genes to identify susceptibility loci for EEM in schizophrenia. We firstly performed EEM test, then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based association study of EEM in 128 individuals with schizophrenia and 143 healthy control subjects. Comparing to healthy controls, schizophrenia patients show significant decrease in NEF (22.99 ± 3.96 vs. 26.02 ± 5.72, P <0.001), TESL (368.78 ± 123.57 vs. 603.12 ± 178.63, P <0.001), MESL (16.86 ± 5.27 vs. 24.42 ± 6.46, P <0.001), RSS (8.22 ± 1.56 vs. 10.92 ± 1.09, P <0.001), and CSS (5.06 ± 0.97 vs. 6.64 ± 0.87, P <0.001). Five SNPs of the MAN2A1, at 5q21.3, were associated with EEM abnormalities (deceased CSS) and satisfied the criteria of GWAS significance threshold. One is localized near 5'-UTR (rs17450784) and four are in intron (rs1438663, rs17162094, rs6877440 and rs10067856) of the gene. Our findings suggest that the identified loci may control the schizophrenia-related quantitative EEM trait. And the identified gene, associated with the EEM phenotype, may lead to new insights into the etiology of schizophrenia.	 18514488 18950366 22634065 21991357 24741992 18417615 22970294 22037552 1553506 19165524 23599252 19881467 16754854 19647329 17093057 20468065 23051017 20497232 10813807 10088045 24785692 2569750 11129321 10580131 11903092 22369367 21184585 1576176 3955112 11705714 12117687 15692563 21397060 15812604 14582142 2334747 11042441 9789207 22958900 11829207 9825220 21858616
26252872	Variations in the FRA10AC1 Fragile Site and 15q21 Are Associated with Cerebrospinal Fluid Aβ1-42 Level.	Proteolytic fragments of amyloid and post-translational modification of tau species in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as cerebral amyloid deposition are important biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease. We conducted genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors influencing CSF biomarker level, cerebral amyloid deposition, and disease progression. The genome-wide association study was performed via a meta-analysis of two non-overlapping discovery sample sets to identify genetic variants other than APOE ε4 predictive of the CSF biomarker level (Aβ1-42, t-Tau, p-Tau181P, t-Tau:Aβ1-42 ratio, and p-Tau181P:Aβ1-42 ratio) in patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Loci passing a genome-wide significance threshold of P < 5 x 10-8 were followed-up for replication in an independent sample set. We also performed joint meta-analysis of both discovery sample sets together with the replication sample set. In the discovery phase, we identified variants in FRA10AC1 associated with CSF Aβ1-42 level passing the genome-wide significance threshold (directly genotyped SNV rs10509663 PFE = 1.1 x 10-9, imputed SNV rs116953792 PFE = 3.5 x 10-10), rs116953792 (Pone-sided = 0.04) achieved replication. This association became stronger in the joint meta-analysis (directly genotyped SNV rs10509663 PFE = 1.7 x 10-9, imputed SNV rs116953792 PFE = 7.6 x 10-11). Additionally, we identified locus 15q21 (imputed SNV rs1503351 PFE = 4.0 x 10-8) associated with CSF Aβ1-42 level. No other variants passed the genome-wide significance threshold for other CSF biomarkers in either the discovery sample sets or joint analysis. Gene set enrichment analyses suggested that targeted genes mediated by miR-33, miR-146, and miR-193 were enriched in various GWAS analyses. This finding is particularly important because CSF biomarkers confer disease susceptibility and may be predictive of the likelihood of disease progression in Alzheimer's Disease. 	 21460841 18193044 12709467 21085570 25126727 22384356 12714109 20466885 19296504 9558143 23419831 20862329 17572673 21798052 14505582 22820512 23824488 16488378 22209051 20517342 25274109 23562540 22919472 24423585 21460840 22534009 21123754 19060911 24450891 20634204 17701901 23054683 17998437 22833209 22513993 17397805 24012743 19543373 17512092

26265699	Genetics of glucocorticoid-associated osteonecrosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Glucocorticoids are important therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and their major adverse effect is osteonecrosis. Our goal was to identify genetic and nongenetic risk factors for osteonecrosis. We performed a genome-wide association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a discovery cohort comprising 2285 children with ALL, treated on the Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 protocol (NCT00075725), adjusting for covariates. The minor allele at SNP rs10989692 (near the glutamate receptor GRIN3A locus) was associated with osteonecrosis (hazard ratio = 2.03; P = 3.59 × 10(-7)). The association was supported by 2 replication cohorts, including 361 children with ALL on St. Jude's Total XV protocol (NCT00137111) and 309 non-ALL patients from Vanderbilt University's BioVU repository treated with glucocorticoids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87 and 2.26; P = .063 and .0074, respectively). In a meta-analysis, rs10989692 was also highest ranked (P = 2.68 × 10(-8)), and the glutamate pathway was the top ranked pathway (P = 9.8 × 10(-4)). Osteonecrosis-associated glutamate receptor variants were also associated with other vascular phenotypes including cerebral ischemia (OR = 1.64; P = 2.5 × 10(-3)), and arterial embolism and thrombosis (OR = 1.88; P = 4.2 × 10(-3)). In conclusion, osteonecrosis was associated with inherited variations near glutamate receptor genes. Further understanding this association may allow interventions to decrease osteonecrosis. These trials are registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00075725 and #NCT00137111. 	 24681836 7634712 20335276 10835412 23700060 10986059 11347834 21148812 21077959 21865285 15459215 20621176 24278430 21602181 20443953 21885611 17989709 24270849 23990467 23553608 23673001 12200152 22901620 20616382 16532393 25539802 14781730 22484422 9365096 20592726 22738862 15576430 24924991 18500243 18285546 19553647 22412151 16407512 22888325 23074066 21947829 25697915 18938768 19066717 18421047 19543373 14962810
26268530	GWAS of longitudinal amyloid accumulation on 18F-florbetapir PET in Alzheimer's disease implicates microglial activation gene IL1RAP.	Brain amyloid deposition is thought to be a seminal event in Alzheimer's disease. To identify genes influencing Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, we performed a genome-wide association study of longitudinal change in brain amyloid burden measured by (18)F-florbetapir PET. A novel association with higher rates of amyloid accumulation independent from APOE (apolipoprotein E) ε4 status was identified in IL1RAP (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein; rs12053868-G; P = 1.38 × 10(-9)) and was validated by deep sequencing. IL1RAP rs12053868-G carriers were more likely to progress from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and exhibited greater longitudinal temporal cortex atrophy on MRI. In independent cohorts rs12053868-G was associated with accelerated cognitive decline and lower cortical (11)C-PBR28 PET signal, a marker of microglial activation. These results suggest a crucial role of activated microglia in limiting amyloid accumulation and nominate the IL-1/IL1RAP pathway as a potential target for modulating this process. 	 21460841 17486121 23836404 20177398 22723552 23477989 21085570 24093081 25619653 26194313 23479569 20142819 25960448 22031440 21304099 21255436 23712469 22801501 20802483 23150908 22595970 23150934 21371747 20501604 12034804 23708142 23419831 25457431 25431634 25485684 24443550 25496902 22820512 20451870 22955616 23883936 23486975 19734902 12958120 20616382 19634037 22865056 22471867 19013689 23562540 20008651 22878163 21391232 25385369 22749065 20620664 24625061 21460840 21478889 25129075 19679070 21852788 25678559 25288138 20373343 12660764 21058334 21952260 24162737 23608917 19481478 16053468 20451875 25329999 25630253 22471860 22968319 18348202 23785173 19451168 21167468 18006619 23237904 8346443 21397060 22480918 20451868 21901424 23684009 23332364 20601685 23446680 23702978 23622250 24614494

26272126	Common and rare variants associated with kidney stones and biochemical traits.	Kidney stone disease is a complex disorder with a strong genetic component. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 28.3 million sequence variants detected through whole-genome sequencing of 2,636 Icelanders that were imputed into 5,419 kidney stone cases, including 2,172 cases with a history of recurrent kidney stones, and 279,870 controls. We identify sequence variants associating with kidney stones at ALPL (rs1256328[T], odds ratio (OR)=1.21, P=5.8 × 10(-10)) and a suggestive association at CASR (rs7627468[A], OR=1.16, P=2.0 × 10(-8)).

26284813	Genome-wide association of polycystic ovary syndrome implicates alterations in gonadotropin secretion in European ancestry populations.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, highly heritable complex disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and defects in glucose homeostasis. Increased luteinizing hormone relative to follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, insulin resistance and developmental exposure to androgens are hypothesized to play a causal role in PCOS. Here we map common genetic susceptibility loci in European ancestry women for the National Institutes of Health PCOS phenotype, which confers the highest risk for metabolic morbidities, as well as reproductive hormone levels. Three loci reach genome-wide significance in the case-control meta-analysis, two novel loci mapping to chr 8p23.1 [Corrected] and chr 11p14.1, and a chr 9q22.32 locus previously found in Chinese PCOS. The same chr 11p14.1 SNP, rs11031006, in the region of the follicle-stimulating hormone B polypeptide (FSHB) gene strongly associates with PCOS diagnosis and luteinizing hormone levels. These findings implicate neuroendocrine changes in disease pathogenesis.	 23065822 23118426 23208300 10566641 10866211 11095431 11121050 12098657 15284005 770505 2885163 8701081 9745406 9830018 9843997 12509226 14711538 15024726 15687497 15713728 16219714 16862161 16963034 16940456 17572673 17701901 17943122 17760884 17785364 18006561 18499708 18559912 18852200 19200528 19369661 19812666 20233392 20616382 22739340 24676280 24534279 24974057 25006718 24990805 25029420 25673413 25574032 20718045 20708005 20719841 21167468 21151128 21234875 21269473 21262361 20979996 21458045 21753753 21926973 21998597 21908468 22125226 22153789 22180642 22138821 22547425 22876189 22885925 22791757
26291516	Genome-wide association study identifies HLA 8.1 ancestral haplotype alleles as major genetic risk factors for myositis phenotypes.	Autoimmune muscle diseases (myositis) comprise a group of complex phenotypes influenced by genetic and environmental factors. To identify genetic risk factors in patients of European ancestry, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the major myositis phenotypes in a total of 1710 cases, which included 705 adult dermatomyositis, 473 juvenile dermatomyositis, 532 polymyositis and 202 adult dermatomyositis, juvenile dermatomyositis or polymyositis patients with anti-histidyl-tRNA synthetase (anti-Jo-1) autoantibodies, and compared them with 4724 controls. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms showing strong associations (P<5×10(-8)) in GWAS were identified in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region for all myositis phenotypes together, as well as for the four clinical and autoantibody phenotypes studied separately. Imputation and regression analyses found that alleles comprising the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH8.1) defined essentially all the genetic risk in the phenotypes studied. Although the HLA DRB1*03:01 allele showed slightly stronger associations with adult and juvenile dermatomyositis, and HLA B*08:01 with polymyositis and anti-Jo-1 autoantibody-positive myositis, multiple alleles of AH8.1 were required for the full risk effects. Our findings establish that alleles of the AH8.1 comprise the primary genetic risk factors associated with the major myositis phenotypes in geographically diverse Caucasian populations.	 17804836 12499305 12849055 15022353 15136663 327194 7030765 1659647 8514867 8411528 9506566 10319267 16532393 16609350 17130525 16507114 17261794 17554300 17701901 17586554 17911430 18193213 19136655 19691932 19690132 19720533 19956098 21224460 21502224 21543121 21552272 21658295 22186711 22241776 22955022 23360883 23657481 23877355 23917628 23834318 23875801 24067379 23983088 24752371 25065005 24939571

26297903	Genetics of long-term treatment outcome in bipolar disorder.	Bipolar disorder (BD) shows one of the strongest genetic predispositions among psychiatric disorders and the identification of reliable genetic predictors of treatment response could significantly improve the prognosis of the disease. The present study investigated genetic predictors of long-term treatment-outcome in 723 patients with BD type I from the STEP-BD (Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder) genome-wide dataset. BD I patients with >6months of follow-up and without any treatment restriction (reflecting a natural setting scenario) were included. Phenotypes were the total and depressive episode rates and the occurrence of one or more (hypo)manic/mixed episodes during follow-up. Quality control of genome-wide data was performed according to standard criteria and linear/logistic regression models were used as appropriate under an additive hypothesis. Top genes were further analyzed through a pathway analysis. Genes previously involved in the susceptibility to BD (DFNB31, SORCS2, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, GRIN2A, GRM4, GRIN2B), antidepressant action (DEPTOR, CHRNA7, NRXN1), and mood stabilizer or antipsychotic action (NTRK2, CHRNA7, NRXN1) may affect long-term treatment outcome of BD. Promising findings without previous strong evidence were TRAF3IP2-AS1, NFYC, RNLS, KCNJ2, RASGRF1, NTF3 genes. Pathway analysis supported particularly the involvement of molecules mediating the positive regulation of MAPK cascade and learning/memory processes. Further studies focused on the outlined genes may be helpful to provide validated markers of BD treatment outcome. 	
26299439	Pathway-Based Genome-wide Association Studies Reveal That the Rac1 Pathway Is Associated with Plasma Adiponectin Levels.	Pathway-based analysis as an alternative and effective approach to identify disease-related genes or loci has been verified. To decipher the genetic background of plasma adiponectin levels, we performed genome wide pathway-based association studies in extremely obese individuals and normal-weight controls. The modified Gene Set Enrichment Algorithm (GSEA) was used to perform the pathway-based analyses (the GenGen Program) in 746 European American females, which were collected from our previous GWAS in extremely obese (BMI > 35 kg/m(2)) and never-overweight (BMI<25 kg/m(2)) controls. Rac1 cell motility signaling pathway was associated with plasma adiponectin after false-discovery rate (FDR) correction (empirical P < 0.001, FDR = 0.008, family-wise error rate = 0.008). Other several Rac1-centered pathways, such as cdc42racPathway (empirical P < 0.001), hsa00603 (empirical P = 0.003) were among the top associations. The RAC1 pathway association was replicated by the ICSNPathway method, yielded a FDR = 0.002. Quantitative pathway analyses yielded similar results (empirical P = 0.001) for the Rac1 pathway, although it failed to pass the multiple test correction (FDR = 0.11). We further replicated our pathway associations in the ADIPOGen Consortium data by the GSA-SNP method. Our results suggest that Rac1 and related cell motility pathways might be associated with plasma adiponectin levels and biological functions of adiponectin. 	 10982546 10918532 14988268 9395435 9347413 9356011 9915959 15784165 16199517 16269654 16339493 16801592 17283229 17701901 18776141 19148467 19165155 19596003 19527447 20011104 20018283 20501604 20887962 20876611 21552555 17966091 21622953 21700879 21829524 21911753 22010046 22479202 22904306 22449616 10598019 14557259
26301497	Genetic association analyses highlight biological pathways underlying mitral valve prolapse.	Nonsyndromic mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common degenerative cardiac valvulopathy of unknown etiology that predisposes to mitral regurgitation, heart failure and sudden death. Previous family and pathophysiological studies suggest a complex pattern of inheritance. We performed a meta-analysis of 2 genome-wide association studies in 1,412 MVP cases and 2,439 controls. We identified 6 loci, which we replicated in 1,422 cases and 6,779 controls, and provide functional evidence for candidate genes. We highlight LMCD1 (LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1), which encodes a transcription factor and for which morpholino knockdown of the ortholog in zebrafish resulted in atrioventricular valve regurgitation. A similar zebrafish phenotype was obtained with knockdown of the ortholog of TNS1, which encodes tensin 1, a focal adhesion protein involved in cytoskeleton organization. We also showed expression of tensin 1 during valve morphogenesis and describe enlarged posterior mitral leaflets in Tns1(-/-) mice. This study identifies the first risk loci for MVP and suggests new mechanisms involved in mitral valve regurgitation, the most common indication for mitral valve repair. 	 23429895 23266859 11714645 12221052 12383578 12707861 7149490 6837604 2739055 9497244 10387935 10521289 15546004 16107477 16172273 16199866 19584346 24206636 17190868 19826001 20026769 21378990 21909825 22328518 21996735 22843703 23468913
26301688	Meta-analysis of shared genetic architecture across ten pediatric autoimmune diseases.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of susceptibility genes, including shared associations across clinically distinct autoimmune diseases. We performed an inverse χ(2) meta-analysis across ten pediatric-age-of-onset autoimmune diseases (pAIDs) in a case-control study including more than 6,035 cases and 10,718 shared population-based controls. We identified 27 genome-wide significant loci associated with one or more pAIDs, mapping to in silico-replicated autoimmune-associated genes (including IL2RA) and new candidate loci with established immunoregulatory functions such as ADGRL2, TENM3, ANKRD30A, ADCY7 and CD40LG. The pAID-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were functionally enriched for deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-hypersensitivity sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites and coding variants. We also identified biologically correlated, pAID-associated candidate gene sets on the basis of immune cell expression profiling and found evidence of genetic sharing. Network and protein-interaction analyses demonstrated converging roles for the signaling pathways of type 1, 2 and 17 helper T cells (TH1, TH2 and TH17), JAK-STAT, interferon and interleukin in multiple autoimmune diseases. 	 26268243 23031829 18758464 18204098 19915574 16199517 18974171 20854658 23703215 17194218 21297633 23143596 16862161 20335276 22384356 21300061 22615847 22560090 23128226 20976797 17068223 22922229 23696745 21383967 21345260 10600329 21852963 19915572 17898773 19169254 12045153 23315928 23128233 9367155 24316577 17966091 21071392 18085728 17572673 21497890 22820512 21829371 19491325 19087329 19073967 12808457 18687881 22174698 20410506 21274314 21743469 21102463 23173617 17604288 23603763 23233247 18852200 15118671 19557189 19098027 23382691 20598278 15875058 23776345 12974897 25479423 19819109 14760812 2013375 19948434 23579070 18800157 21152010 20153395 24076602 17554300 16391555 22955989 23603761 22096230 12503609 18576341 17701901 19561590 21833088 18204446 9144474 25352552 23203871 17632545 16211091 21167468 16335914 23178822 21397060 20362271 20453842 20562413 20235204 16381832 10802651 1376102 22961000 15738055 19543373 23345460 22942788 17162361 22121212 15934099 17784955 23143594 21249183 2423876
26305897	Genome-Wide Association and Trans-ethnic Meta-Analysis for Advanced Diabetic Kidney Disease: Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND).	Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common etiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the industrialized world and accounts for much of the excess mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Approximately 45% of U.S. patients with incident end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have DKD. Independent of glycemic control, DKD aggregates in families and has higher incidence rates in African, Mexican, and American Indian ancestral groups relative to European populations. The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) contrasting 6,197 unrelated individuals with advanced DKD with healthy and diabetic individuals lacking nephropathy of European American, African American, Mexican American, or American Indian ancestry. A large-scale replication and trans-ethnic meta-analysis included 7,539 additional European American, African American and American Indian DKD cases and non-nephropathy controls. Within ethnic group meta-analysis of discovery GWAS and replication set results identified genome-wide significant evidence for association between DKD and rs12523822 on chromosome 6q25.2 in American Indians (P = 5.74x10-9). The strongest signal of association in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis was with a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs12523822 (rs955333; P = 1.31x10-8), with directionally consistent results across ethnic groups. These 6q25.2 SNPs are located between the SCAF8 and CNKSR3 genes, a region with DKD relevant changes in gene expression and an eQTL with IPCEF1, a gene co-translated with CNKSR3. Several other SNPs demonstrated suggestive evidence of association with DKD, within and across populations. These data identify a novel DKD susceptibility locus with consistent directions of effect across diverse ancestral groups and provide insight into the genetic architecture of DKD. 	 15642484 17525332 17363742 17728769 17903292 17942768 18003762 18550522 18794854 18794856 19017763 19252134 19443635 19567370 19875814 20168990 20383146 20647424 20881960 21186350 21307933 21150874 21188353 21412221 21412220 21693741 21698141 21852671 22085542 21968013 22826311 22797727 22751958 22851176 23028342 23347458 24029425 24029427 24311711 23773264 20606456 1848670 8413456 7945203 7711722 9742212 11387043 11565518 12819328 15252773 2813419

26312577	Bivariate Genome-Wide Association Study Implicates ATP6V1G1 as a Novel Pleiotropic Locus Underlying Osteoporosis and Age at Menarche.	Age at menarche (AAM) is determined by the overall duration of endocrine-tissue sex hormone exposure levels. Osteoporosis, the most common metabolic bone disease, is characterized primarily by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of low trauma fractures. Bone was an endocrine organ regulating the synthesis and secretion of sex steroid hormones. The mutual dependence between bone and gonads underscore the importance of genetic approaches to identify novel pleiotropic genetic factors coregulating BMD and AAM. In this study, we performed a bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore novel ethnic common loci and/or genes that may influence both AAM and BMD.	 16925584 17144789 21221218 17680356 16862161 18379822 22171069 9492970 22125221 12086351 19282465 24249740 21351666 22805710 1873451 24086263 20616382 19324521 22407998 12730767 15221497 10399824 11918225 21956596 24998176 22258758 23644456 12730800 10942435 23756892 22652318 25231870 17290355 16362457 20634204 12050121 12817771 24879436 11914195 15845915

26314684	Genome-wide Association Study of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the East Asian Populations.	Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic basis. To identify common genetic variations conferring the risk of ASD, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study using ASD family and healthy control samples obtained from East Asian populations. A total of 166 ASD families (n = 500) and 642 healthy controls from the Japanese population were used as the discovery cohort. Approximately 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 chips. In the replication stage, 205 Japanese ASD cases and 184 healthy controls, as well as 418 Chinese Han trios (n = 1,254), were genotyped by TaqMan platform. Case-control analysis, family based association test, and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) were then conducted to test the association. In the discovery stage, significant associations were suggested for 14 loci, including 5 known ASD candidate genes: GPC6, JARID2, YTHDC2, CNTN4, and CSMD1. In addition, significant associations were identified for several novel genes with intriguing functions, such as JPH3, PTPRD, CUX1, and RIT2. After a meta-analysis combining the Japanese replication samples, the strongest signal was found at rs16976358 (P = 6.04 × 10(-7)), which is located near the RIT2 gene. In summary, our results provide independent support to known ASD candidate genes and highlight a number of novel genes warranted to be further investigated in a larger sample set in an effort to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of ASD.	
26235824	Two Rare Mutations in the COL1A2 Gene Associate With Low Bone Mineral Density and Fractures in Iceland.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of low bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and spine utilizing sequence variants found through whole-genome sequencing of 2636 Icelanders. We found two rare missense mutations, p.Gly496Ala and p.Gly703Ser, in the COL1A2 gene that associate with measures of osteoporosis in Icelanders. Mutations in COL1A2 are known to cause the autosomal dominant disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. Both variants associate with low BMD and with osteoporotic fractures. p.Gly496Ala (frequency of 0.105%) shows the strongest association with low BMD at the spine (p = 1.8 × 10(-7) , odds ratio [OR] = 4.61 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.59, 8.18]), whereas p.Gly703Ser (frequency of 0.050%) is most strongly associated with low BMD at the hip (p = 1.9 × 10(-8) , OR = 9.34 [95% CI 4.28, 20.3]). Association with fractures was p = 2.2 × 10(-5) , OR = 3.75 (95% CI 2.03, 6.93) and p = 0.0023, OR = 4.32 (95% CI 1.69, 11.1), respectively. The carriers of these variants do not have signs of osteogenesis imperfecta other than low BMD, demonstrating that similar mutations in COL1A2 can affect skeletal phenotypes in more than one way.	
26323598	Genome-wide association study on antipsychotic-induced weight gain in the CATIE sample.	Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a common side effect with a high genetic contribution. We reanalyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) selecting a refined subset of patients most suitable for AIWG studies. The final GWAS was conducted in N=189 individuals. The top polymorphisms were analyzed in a second cohort of N=86 patients. None of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms was significant at the genome-wide threshold of 5x10(-8). We observed interesting trends for rs9346455 (P=6.49x10(-6)) upstream of OGFRL1, the intergenic variants rs7336345 (P=1.31 × 10(-5)) and rs1012650 (P=1.47 × 10(-5)), and rs1059778 (P=1.49x10(-5)) in IBA57. In the second cohort, rs9346455 showed significant association with AIWG (P=0.005). The combined meta-analysis P-value for rs9346455 was 1.09 × 10(-7). Our reanalysis of the CATIE GWAS data revealed interesting new variants associated with AIWG. As the functional relevance of these polymorphisms is yet to be determined, further studies are needed.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 1 September 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.59.	 23226055 23920449 23138311 23799528 22701605 22566560 16192744 25138234 22323289 22039372 20616382 19156168 24624910 16172203 23277265 20195266 21894153 21862448 15998156 18510647 22860242 24196945 23462291

26421299	Genetic Interactions Explain Variance in Cingulate Amyloid Burden: An AV-45 PET Genome-Wide Association and Interaction Study in the ADNI Cohort.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Using discrete disease status as the phenotype and computing statistics at the single marker level may not be able to address the underlying biological interactions that contribute to disease mechanism and may contribute to the issue of "missing heritability." We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) of an amyloid imaging phenotype, using the data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We investigated the genetic main effects and interaction effects on cingulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) load in an effort to better understand the genetic etiology of Aβ deposition that is a widely studied AD biomarker. PLINK was used in the single marker GWAS, and INTERSNP was used to perform the two-marker GWIS, focusing only on SNPs with p ≤ 0.01 for the GWAS analysis. Age, sex, and diagnosis were used as covariates in both analyses. Corrected p values using the Bonferroni method were reported. The GWAS analysis revealed significant hits within or proximal to APOE, APOC1, and TOMM40 genes, which were previously implicated in AD. The GWIS analysis yielded 8 novel SNP-SNP interaction findings that warrant replication and further investigation.	 9530504 11375494 17616482 17701901 18339640 19296504 19446537 19154537 19634037 19668339 19734902 19822868 10835412 24026422 14561895 8346443 8152607 19837719 19853650 20451875 20571217 20100581 20955934 21123754 21245183 21132329 21460840 21460841 21514248 21514249 21321396 22445811 23107432 23419831 24092460 24958194 25104557 23022416 23516589 23707588 23932184 24162737 16862161
26343869	Genome-wide association study on progression of carotid artery intima media thickness over 10 years in a Chinese cohort.	Carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT) in human is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis with high heritability. Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed in European and American populations, yet discovery efforts have been limited in Asians.	
26350878	Genome-wide association study for rotator cuff tears identifies two significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms.	The precise etiology of rotator cuff disease is unknown, but prior evidence suggests a role for genetic factors. Limited data exist identifying specific genes associated with rotator cuff tearing. The purpose of this study was to identify specific genes or genetic variants associated with rotator cuff tearing by a genome-wide association study with an independent set of rotator cuff tear cases.	
26343387	A comprehensive 1,000 Genomes-based genome-wide association meta-analysis of coronary artery disease.	Existing knowledge of genetic variants affecting risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is largely based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of common SNPs. Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 < MAF < 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.	 24316577 24507774 24604202 24941081 25390462 10559937 11315092 11701621 12000961 12111919 14699081 3802833 22820512 22876189 22885922 22885924 22955616 22955828 22941192 23128226 15834428 16209944 16554528 16675726 25487149 17018701 17237547 17352422 17554300 17634449 17878422 17980156 18499582 18974833 19103604 19481926 20032323 20126254 20485568 20502693 20579540 20509871 20601685 20881960 20935629 20935630 21082891 21167468 21239051 21378986 21378988 21378990 21593864 21374718 21407268 21829388 21909110 21966275 21909115 21901532 23209423 23202125 23382694 23345460 23616109 24013639 23921380 24097068 2176219 7697725 15721306 15851591 22129254 22184326 22300583 22426310 22319020 24213632 24209692 24262325
26348319	A genome-wide association study of antidepressant response in Koreans.	We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of response to antidepressant drugs in an ethnically homogeneous sample of Korean patients in untreated episodes of nonpsychotic unipolar depression, mostly of mature onset. Strict quality control was maintained in case selection, diagnosis, verification of adherence and outcome assessments. Analyzed cases completed 6 weeks of treatment with adequate plasma drug concentrations. The overall successful completion rate was 85.5%. Four candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on three chromosomes were identified by genome-wide search in the discovery sample of 481 patients who received one of four allowed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs (Stage 1). In a focused replication study of 230 SSRI-treated patients, two of these four SNP candidates were confirmed (Stage 2). Analysis of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 samples combined (n = 711) revealed GWAS significance (P = 1.60 × 10(-8)) for these two SNP candidates, which were in perfect linkage disequilibrium. These two significant SNPs were confirmed also in a focused cross-replication study of 159 patients treated with the non-SSRI antidepressant drug mirtazapine (Stage 3). Analysis of the Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 samples combined (n = 870) also revealed GWAS significance for these two SNPs, which was sustained after controlling for gender, age, number of previous episodes, age at onset and baseline severity (P = 3.57 × 10(-8)). For each SNP, the response rate decreased (odds ratio=0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.47) as a function of the number of minor alleles (non-response alleles). The two SNPs significantly associated with antidepressant response are rs7785360 and rs12698828 of the AUTS2 gene, located on chromosome 7 in 7q11.22. This gene has multiple known linkages to human psychological functions and neurobehavioral disorders. Rigorous replication efforts in other ethnic populations are recommended.	 16390886 9564194 6080235 19797435 16460696 21085122 24451568 23091423 21876681 16165158 22885912 3395203 22183176 22915352 24008202 18982004 18300295 22008447 19567891 16391422 24252905 20448178 23095326 17018806 19259986 16690084 6376481 23377640 19846067 9789202 17082449 15322418 12527472 16642436 24643514 18262675 7811843 22907730 19736353 22584459 22872102 16979146 20360315 7912194 17701901 19948250 18348202 19880459 16021664 18179895 22137564 22169941 2887090 21115088 12813121 12160723 18586274 14684453
26352407	Genome-Wide Association Study with Targeted and Non-targeted NMR Metabolomics Identifies 15 Novel Loci of Urinary Human Metabolic Individuality.	Genome-wide association studies with metabolic traits (mGWAS) uncovered many genetic variants that influence human metabolism. These genetically influenced metabotypes (GIMs) contribute to our metabolic individuality, our capacity to respond to environmental challenges, and our susceptibility to specific diseases. While metabolic homeostasis in blood is a well investigated topic in large mGWAS with over 150 known loci, metabolic detoxification through urinary excretion has only been addressed by few small mGWAS with only 11 associated loci so far. Here we report the largest mGWAS to date, combining targeted and non-targeted 1H NMR analysis of urine samples from 3,861 participants of the SHIP-0 cohort and 1,691 subjects of the KORA F4 cohort. We identified and replicated 22 loci with significant associations with urinary traits, 15 of which are new (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, PNMT, SLC13A3). Two-thirds of the urinary loci also have a metabolite association in blood. For all but one of the 6 loci where significant associations target the same metabolite in blood and urine, the genetic effects have the same direction in both fluids. In contrast, for the SLC5A11 locus, we found increased levels of myo-inositol in urine whereas mGWAS in blood reported decreased levels for the same genetic variant. This might indicate less effective re-absorption of myo-inositol in the kidneys of carriers. In summary, our study more than doubles the number of known loci that influence urinary phenotypes. It thus allows novel insights into the relationship between blood homeostasis and its regulation through excretion. The newly discovered loci also include variants previously linked to chronic kidney disease (CPS1, SLC6A13), pulmonary hypertension (CPS1), and ischemic stroke (XYLB). By establishing connections from gene to disease via metabolic traits our results provide novel hypotheses about molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of diseases. 	 15172003 24097068 12351146 17604727 18252821 23179721 18043717 19043545 21572414 20167617 18941301 22241472 24234437 23128226 12775515 23551880 12039040 25613900 25569235 11470804 3938801 4585091 19033659 24077912 17453936 17898773 20204374 20578160 24316577 22138821 22672667 16032513 23161693 20686565 20972438 18191109 11565448 20154341 14718356 20383145 9512943 24390342 21474802 17932225 24023812 17355966 10496672 9783918 3938803 16274478 23281178 25375201 20383146 10794676 24159190 17306760 21886157 23720494 24816436 24816252 23065485 2208646 23823483 21931564 24586340 20037589 16416399 23535967 24122314 23032255 23093944 24354303 23414815 17701901 24681537 15965474 24163127 24047826 25431330 24586186 2068113 11073718 22286219 19148276 19798445 24625756 23378610 6458298 23969696 19543373
26362759	Dense genotyping of immune-related loci in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies confirms HLA alleles as the strongest genetic risk factor and suggests different genetic background for major clinical subgroups.	The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of rare autoimmune diseases characterised by muscle weakness and extramuscular manifestations such as skin rashes and interstitial lung disease. We genotyped 2566 IIM cases of Caucasian descent using the Immunochip; a custom array covering 186 established autoimmune susceptibility loci. The cohort was predominantly comprised of patients with dermatomyositis (DM, n=879), juvenile DM (JDM, n=481), polymyositis (PM, n=931) and inclusion body myositis (n=252) collected from 14 countries through the Myositis Genetics Consortium.	 23459209 1090839 23143596 23143594 21138882 22922229 7486861 23762245 23983088 23315928 22402141 23128233 20074951 24871463 16273109 20837527 22143225 16024819 21224460 24390342 18821667 25640675 23603763 20502693 24268584 19430480 24097067 19644074 24387989 1659647 24076602 24632671 22955989 23603761 1089199 21841778 19561590 22057235 17873874 24812289 20702402 19838195 25751624 18846210 22961000 22561518 20220756
26366553	Genome-wide association analyses based on whole-genome sequencing in Sardinia provide insights into regulation of hemoglobin levels.	We report genome-wide association study results for the levels of A1, A2 and fetal hemoglobins, analyzed for the first time concurrently. Integrating high-density array genotyping and whole-genome sequencing in a large general population cohort from Sardinia, we detected 23 associations at 10 loci. Five signals are due to variants at previously undetected loci: MPHOSPH9, PLTP-PCIF1, ZFPM1 (FOG1), NFIX and CCND3. Among the signals at known loci, ten are new lead variants and four are new independent signals. Half of all variants also showed pleiotropic associations with different hemoglobins, which further corroborated some of the detected associations and identified features of coordinated hemoglobin species production. 	 22304583 24614105 20502693 21613252 22115833 21157349 24270787 24092820 15315760 23128226 26366554 25606059 22929040 22253318 24037378 19965587 24115442 18294453 11375492 23896219 6457059 9675875 22291609 21385855 12483298 22820512 24183450 18667698 22936743 20616382 21273267 20201948 21637794 1932737 20676099 15075390 19820697 19557189 24604202 21829388 18245381 18568278 11731797 22293038 16896160 19644074 21347282 17767159 17982457 23193274 21058334 16934002 22307276 20220758 25261933 25293720 24487276 22843986 20139978 21821711 25480500 23222517 21326311 19060906 21811411 17873874 24766805 15855277 14692233 20676097 23043469 22286219 18846210 10802651 21807894 22271886 19543373 24041575 24013639 10700180 20208533
26365420	The genetics of alcohol dependence: Twin and SNP-based heritability, and genome-wide association study based on AUDIT scores.	Alcohol dependence (AD) is among the most common and costly public health problems contributing to morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In this study, we investigate the genetic basis of AD in a Dutch population using data from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) and the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The presence of AD was ascertained via the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) applying cut-offs with good specificity and sensitivity in identifying those at risk for AD. Twin-based heritability of AD-AUDIT was estimated using structural equation modeling of data in 7,694 MZ and DZ twin pairs. Variance in AD-AUDIT explained by all SNPs was estimated with genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 7,842 subjects. GWAS SNP effect concordance analysis was performed between our GWAS and a recent AD GWAS using DSM-IV diagnosis. The twin-based heritability of AD-AUDIT was estimated at 60% (55-69%). GCTA showed that common SNPs jointly capture 33% (SE = 0.12, P = 0.002) of this heritability. In the GWAS, the top hits were positioned within four regions (4q31.1, 2p16.1, 6q25.1, 7p14.1) with the strongest association detected for rs55768019 (P = 7.58 × 10(-7) ). This first GWAS of AD using the AUDIT measure found results consistent with previous genetic studies using DSM diagnosis: concordance in heritability estimates and direction of SNPs effect and overlap with top hits from previous GWAS. Thus, the use of appropriate questionnaires may represent cost-effective strategies to phenotype samples in large-scale biobanks or other population-based datasets.

26379185	No Major Host Genetic Risk Factor Contributed to A(H1N1)2009 Influenza Severity.	While most patients affected by the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic experienced mild symptoms, a small fraction required hospitalization, often without concomitant factors that could explain such a severe course. We hypothesize that host genetic factors could contribute to aggravate the disease. To test this hypothesis, we compared the allele frequencies of 547,296 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between 49 severe and 107 mild confirmed influenza A cases, as well as against a general population sample of 549 individuals. When comparing severe vs. mild influenza A cases, only one SNP was close to the conventional p = 5×10-8. This SNP, rs28454025, sits in an intron of the GSK233 gene, which is involved in a neural development, but seems not to have any connections with immunological or inflammatory functions. Indirectly, a previous association reported with CD55 was replicated. Although sample sizes are low, we show that the statistical power in our design was sufficient to detect highly-penetrant, quasi-Mendelian genetic factors. Hence, and assuming that rs28454025 is likely to be a false positive, no major genetic factor was detected that could explain poor influenza A course. 	 22412995 12499305 16481321 17701901 19648217 21176216 21408207 21596021 22172537 22269998 21737555 22446628 22438897 22693232 22158997 23148654 17903303 18171280 18216264 19132087 19264973
26377243	Genome- and exome-wide association study of serum lipoprotein (a) in the Jackson Heart Study.	Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Lp(a) levels in African Americans (AAs) are much higher compared with that in European Americans. We conducted a genome- and an exome-wide association study of Lp(a) among 2895 AAs participating in the Jackson Heart Study. We observed that local ancestry at 6q25.3 was an important risk factor for Lp(a) in AAs, and that multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the well-established LPA locus were significantly associated with Lp(a) (P<5 × 10(-8)) after adjusting for the local ancestry at 6q25.3. Interestingly, before adjusting for local ancestry, we observed significant (P<5 × 10(-8)) associations for hundreds of SNPs spanning ~10 Mb region on 6q surrounding the LPA gene, whereas after adjusting for local ancestry, the region containing significantly associated SNPs got much narrower and was centered over the LPA gene (<1 Mb). We observed a single nonsynonymous SNP in APOE significantly associated with Lp(a) (P<5 × 10(-8)). A high burden of coding variants in LPA and APOE were also associated with higher Lp(a) levels. Our study provides evidence that ancestry-specific causal risk variant(s) resides in or near LPA and that most of the observed associations outside this narrower region are spurious associations. 	 8956154 22699862 16317984 19148283 16862161 9017509 23063622 15367870 16317983 19214210 15088269 8602597 23315928 22549815 10842743 19124843 21169375 17172560 8556815 21283670 9311746 1836947 8366120 16532393 7989589 2026424 15297300 19622820 20965889 7874778 8118476 1386087 21058334 20160194 21737059 17701901 20889494 8018666 11060351 7819721 20032323 19648217 12824425 8678918 16441261 8010888
26390057	Trans-ancestry genome-wide association study identifies 12 genetic loci influencing blood pressure and implicates a role for DNA methylation.	We carried out a trans-ancestry genome-wide association and replication study of blood pressure phenotypes among up to 320,251 individuals of East Asian, European and South Asian ancestry. We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 × 10(-11) to 5.0 × 10(-21)). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 × 10(-6)). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation.	 21909115 16972045 24006081 20502693 14660243 22125221 23245609 22064851 23384616 23883380 19609347 26095709 23034089 24709820 23972371 19342607 23104008 14870823 21572416 11956507 19430479 21677658 21909110 21060006 20383145 22748066 25853392 20529999 22964528 21821672 23168336 19106393 20308177 22568884 21911940 21082022 22100073 19430483 23912809 22190696 16537907 19960030 23990415 20562413 24690455 23919675 23151460 23383064 23782920 23303523
26394269	International genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new primary biliary cirrhosis risk loci and targetable pathogenic pathways.	Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a classical autoimmune liver disease for which effective immunomodulatory therapy is lacking. Here we perform meta-analyses of discovery data sets from genome-wide association studies of European subjects (n=2,764 cases and 10,475 controls) followed by validation genotyping in an independent cohort (n=3,716 cases and 4,261 controls). We discover and validate six previously unknown risk loci for PBC (Pcombined<5 × 10(-8)) and used pathway analysis to identify JAK-STAT/IL12/IL27 signalling and cytokine-cytokine pathways, for which relevant therapies exist. 	 11315092 16862161 17572673 17701901 19458352 19561590 20233392 20354512 20418889 20435672 20639879 20639880 20702402 21058334 21167468 21399635 22171328 22138821 22955617 22955828 22961000 23000144 22796894 22936693 23221638 23347352 23708191 24183450 24122041 24702953 25363779
26394188	Genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in Chinese girls.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a structural deformity of the spine affecting millions of children. As a complex disease, the genetic aetiology of AIS remains obscure. Here we report the results of a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a sample of 4,317 AIS patients and 6,016 controls. Overall, we identify three new susceptibility loci at 1p36.32 near AJAP1 (rs241215, Pcombined=2.95 × 10(-9)), 2q36.1 between PAX3 and EPHA4 (rs13398147, Pcombined=7.59 × 10(-13)) and 18q21.33 near BCL-2 (rs4940576, Pcombined=2.22 × 10(-12)). In addition, we refine a previously reported region associated with AIS at 10q24.32 (rs678741, Pcombined=9.68 × 10(-37)), which suggests LBX1AS1, encoding an antisense transcript of LBX1, might be a functional variant of AIS. This is the first GWAS investigating genetic variants associated with AIS in Chinese population, and the findings provide new insight into the multiple aetiological mechanisms of AIS. 	 19092622 17534191 17506689 16862161 2649564 22019779 17571346 17996118 23446766 10193316 22064851 25436317 21308753 17023856 18985072 10699973 17168980 20664068 21216876 9321682 1425345 15297300 23666238 17108395 23096252 25618543 6665578 22036717 10393760 22193623 21520258 21085651 25784220 16410724 24026176 13655060 22301463 19424484 20634204 14595118 10095428 12438984 17701901 23074066 21867959 18644785 22491950 11747084 20605921 24512353 23308168 22241217 24247014 4760104

26401656	Integration of Genome-Wide SNP Data and Gene-Expression Profiles Reveals Six Novel Loci and Regulatory Mechanisms for Amino Acids and Acylcarnitines in Whole Blood.	Profiling amino acids and acylcarnitines in whole blood spots is a powerful tool in the laboratory diagnosis of several inborn errors of metabolism. Emerging data suggests that altered blood levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines are also associated with common metabolic diseases in adults. Thus, the identification of common genetic determinants for blood metabolites might shed light on pathways contributing to human physiology and common diseases. We applied a targeted mass-spectrometry-based method to analyze whole blood concentrations of 96 amino acids, acylcarnitines and pathway associated metabolite ratios in a Central European cohort of 2,107 adults and performed genome-wide association (GWA) to identify genetic modifiers of metabolite concentrations. We discovered and replicated six novel loci associated with blood levels of total acylcarnitine, arginine (both on chromosome 6; rs12210538, rs17657775), propionylcarnitine (chromosome 10; rs12779637), 2-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (chromosome 21; rs1571700), stearoylcarnitine (chromosome 1; rs3811444), and aspartic acid traits (chromosome 8; rs750472). Based on an integrative analysis of expression quantitative trait loci in blood mononuclear cells and correlations between gene expressions and metabolite levels, we provide evidence for putative causative genes: SLC22A16 for total acylcarnitines, ARG1 for arginine, HLCS for 2-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine, JAM3 for stearoylcarnitine via a trans-effect at chromosome 1, and PPP1R16A for aspartic acid traits. Further, we report replication and provide additional functional evidence for ten loci that have previously been published for metabolites measured in plasma, serum or urine. In conclusion, our integrative analysis of SNP, gene-expression and metabolite data points to novel genetic factors that may be involved in the regulation of human metabolism. At several loci, we provide evidence for metabolite regulation via gene-expression and observed overlaps with GWAS loci for common diseases. These results form a strong rationale for subsequent functional and disease-related studies. 	 25707927 20525181 19369366 23144319 24097068 15716906 16862161 19007853 24320595 21572414 11901134 22216169 23319000 19356713 21798003 19729412 21559053 21272319 18202305 22628656 20154341 15461798 12241016 20383145 17660554 23639448 22156771 22916037 20354512 20860503 22359512 19503597 23281178 16632515 20383146 22863734 21829388 21886157 20031577 24740359 20592283 26019233 24816252 20056914 25521368 23823483 21931564 23646285 20037589 11337480 21738487 20111019 17886233 20139978 818729 23222517 22139419 20709048 24586186 18060068 22225612 22955828 22286219 19148276 23861667 19798445 24625756 23378610 22492648 19357637 24013639 22560213
26545630	A potential endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease: cerebrospinal fluid clusterin.	Genome-wide association studies have associated clusterin (CLU) variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of CLU on AD pathogenesis is not totally understood. We used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma CLU levels as endophenotypes for genetic studies to understand the role of CLU in AD. CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated with AD status and CSF tau/amyloid-beta ratio, and highly correlated with CSF apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels. Several loci showed almost genome-wide significant associations including LINC00917 (p = 3.98 × 10(-7)) and interleukin 6 (IL6, p = 9.94 × 10(-6), in the entire data set and in the APOE ε4- individuals p = 7.40 × 10(-8)). Gene ontology analyses suggest that CSF CLU levels may be associated with wound healing and immune response which supports previous functional studies that demonstrated an association between CLU and IL6. CLU may play a role in AD by influencing immune system changes that have been observed in AD or by disrupting healing after neurodegeneration.	 12551933 22782911 17056579 21467285 18974171 17210801 18832364 16473512 16862161 16490286 22544707 19539887 24243840 19296504 22025968 25340798 1974459 14681407 12045153 11125122 1702645 7589331 19177010 8892354 17326099 21505792 23193289 8232972 23521156 8328966 16372280 19734902 16912992 25722852 16415888 18075673 23562540 21989726 14741101 19734903 22821396 14681465 24162737 16870640 21805181 15051507 21220649 9415971 12928051 22080510 24767179 18158299 24548642 24378367 10802651 21071422 11544197 20601685 23360079

26422391	Candidate Loci are Revealed by an Initial Genome-wide Association Study of Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans.	Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a condition that oftentimes causes significant knee pain in pediatric patient populations. If left untreated, OCD significantly increases the risk of developing degenerative osteoarthritis along with its associated consequences and costs. Although a genetic component has been suggested to play a role in this disorder, few studies have been carried out in order to determine the underlying genetic etiology of this relatively common complex trait. The goal of our study was to perform an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) to uncover candidate loci associated with the pathogenesis of OCD.	
26417704	Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies five modifier loci of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis.	The identification of small molecules that target specific CFTR variants has ushered in a new era of treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), yet optimal, individualized treatment of CF will require identification and targeting of disease modifiers. Here we use genome-wide association analysis to identify genetic modifiers of CF lung disease, the primary cause of mortality. Meta-analysis of 6,365 CF patients identifies five loci that display significant association with variation in lung disease. Regions on chr3q29 (MUC4/MUC20; P=3.3 × 10(-11)), chr5p15.3 (SLC9A3; P=6.8 × 10(-12)), chr6p21.3 (HLA Class II; P=1.2 × 10(-8)) and chrXq22-q23 (AGTR2/SLC6A14; P=1.8 × 10(-9)) contain genes of high biological relevance to CF pathophysiology. The fifth locus, on chr11p12-p13 (EHF/APIP; P=1.9 × 10(-10)), was previously shown to be associated with lung disease. These results provide new insights into potential targets for modulating lung disease severity in CF. 	 21602797 21251289 9872837 25056061 21603163 23284291 25414352 11031343 22837397 15976373 24115442 19164484 18300295 25640674 16207846 20967843 21565292 22143225 23276843 25282103 18292811 18667698 24105369 23209180 17329403 9374110 21993476 10228112 22466613 18245381 1577762 22772370 24367089 23974870 17630322 22923574 23278646 21462361 20634204 24994462 17701901 25266997 17332481 23873844 24057835 1374392 22929560 24651541 24951776
26416764	Causal mechanisms and balancing selection inferred from genetic associations with polycystic ovary syndrome.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women, yet there is little consensus regarding its aetiology. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of PCOS in up to 5,184 self-reported cases of White European ancestry and 82,759 controls, with follow-up in a further ∼2,000 clinically validated cases and ∼100,000 controls. We identify six signals for PCOS at genome-wide statistical significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), in/near genes ERBB4/HER4, YAP1, THADA, FSHB, RAD50 and KRR1. Variants in/near three of the four epidermal growth factor receptor genes (ERBB2/HER2, ERBB3/HER3 and ERBB4/HER4) are associated with PCOS at or near genome-wide significance. Mendelian randomization analyses indicate causal roles in PCOS aetiology for higher BMI (P=2.5 × 10(-9)), higher insulin resistance (P=6 × 10(-4)) and lower serum sex hormone binding globulin concentrations (P=5 × 10(-4)). Furthermore, genetic susceptibility to later menopause is associated with higher PCOS risk (P=1.6 × 10(-8)) and PCOS-susceptibility alleles are associated with higher serum anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations in girls (P=8.9 × 10(-5)). This large-scale study implicates an aetiological role of the epidermal growth factor receptors, infers causal mechanisms relevant to clinical management and prevention, and suggests balancing selection mechanisms involved in PCOS risk. 	 22885925 22547425 23118426 23415221 23420000 23352610 23762215 24002403 24092832 24106282 24151290 24357391 24678841 24901400 24694833 25102153 24947364 25239303 25218548 25904635 23131671 12098657 9408743 9536211 15561799 16260720 17253562 18337605 19005469 19657112 20375205 21151128 21328294 14688154 14726596 21858135 21364581 15217995 22147920 22180642 22172593 22267201 22479202 22592687 23128226
26416757	A novel locus of resistance to severe malaria in a region of ancient balancing selection.	The high prevalence of sickle haemoglobin in Africa shows that malaria has been a major force for human evolutionary selection, but surprisingly few other polymorphisms have been proven to confer resistance to malaria in large epidemiological studies. To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.76, P value = 9.5 × 10(-11)) and is linked to polymorphisms that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees. Taken together with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O, these data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights into the host-parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome of malaria infection. 	 20864995 25805752 21383971 21664997 22057162 22307718 22532805 22513993 22722859 22820512 22895189 23128226 21283638 10588724 11103309 11356514 11861881 11932250 12690197 12949139 23091028 23104008 23269371 23413192 23717212 14681465 8009226 8535438 9469800 15772651 15815621 17087826 17554300 18003641 18653518 19279206 19543373 18642345 19666593 20084087 20502693 19465909 24316577 24776769 25203297 25261933 25470054 25954001
26424050	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for glioma.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown that common genetic variation contributes to the heritable risk of glioma. To identify new glioma susceptibility loci, we conducted a meta-analysis of four GWAS (totalling 4,147 cases and 7,435 controls), with imputation using 1000 Genomes and UK10K Project data as reference. After genotyping an additional 1,490 cases and 1,723 controls we identify new risk loci for glioblastoma (GBM) at 12q23.33 (rs3851634, near POLR3B, P=3.02 × 10(-9)) and non-GBM at 10q25.2 (rs11196067, near VTI1A, P=4.32 × 10(-8)), 11q23.2 (rs648044, near ZBTB16, P=6.26 × 10(-11)), 12q21.2 (rs12230172, P=7.53 × 10(-11)) and 15q24.2 (rs1801591, near ETFA, P=5.71 × 10(-9)). Our findings provide further insights into the genetic basis of the different glioma subtypes. 	 21531791 18798534 23571737 20858744 24119843 25693563 17895893 17194218 25314060 22941192 23558742 16862161 17977614 23398472 16490960 19356978 24037378 21807936 22064851 19578367 22837180 23550210 15965027 19636000 1882842 24842956 24670763 16032514 19578366 18579814 12177636 17572673 19684571 8387545 12029063 23399484 12958120 17618441 24908248 23143601 17529973 20354512 21653522 1430199 3053288 18076069 17401363 15557412 25105248 20435672 26368830 17636416 9770450 22243751 18715499 22955989 24487276 22036171 20418889 24227677 16228001 20981092 23281567 16131485 10356313 19543373 25208325 24013639 17102640
26426971	The Influence of Age and Sex on Genetic Associations with Adult Body Size and Shape: A Large-Scale Genome-Wide Interaction Study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 genetic variants contributing to BMI, a measure of body size, or waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), a measure of body shape. Body size and shape change as people grow older and these changes differ substantially between men and women. To systematically screen for age- and/or sex-specific effects of genetic variants on BMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed meta-analyses of 114 studies (up to 320,485 individuals of European descent) with genome-wide chip and/or Metabochip data by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium. Each study tested the association of up to ~2.8M SNPs with BMI and WHRadjBMI in four strata (men ≤50y, men >50y, women ≤50y, women >50y) and summary statistics were combined in stratum-specific meta-analyses. We then screened for variants that showed age-specific effects (G x AGE), sex-specific effects (G x SEX) or age-specific effects that differed between men and women (G x AGE x SEX). For BMI, we identified 15 loci (11 previously established for main effects, four novel) that showed significant (FDR<5%) age-specific effects, of which 11 had larger effects in younger (<50y) than in older adults (≥50y). No sex-dependent effects were identified for BMI. For WHRadjBMI, we identified 44 loci (27 previously established for main effects, 17 novel) with sex-specific effects, of which 28 showed larger effects in women than in men, five showed larger effects in men than in women, and 11 showed opposite effects between sexes. No age-dependent effects were identified for WHRadjBMI. This is the first genome-wide interaction meta-analysis to report convincing evidence of age-dependent genetic effects on BMI. In addition, we confirm the sex-specificity of genetic effects on WHRadjBMI. These results may provide further insights into the biology that underlies weight change with age or the sexually dimorphism of body shape. 	 16271645 11315092 18974171 23300277 22876189 20680015 24097064 20543033 20562875 17384015 14559384 10843999 24954895 10546691 10372664 19715440 12503980 19880856 18030323 21379325 17572673 20125193 19734545 11323317 20881960 16252236 20686565 12470915 23669352 20616382 20935630 23754948 20935629 9006309 19646654 21465548 21102463 23160366 22995226 21829388 19005195 20233392 22275760 19115520 23168566 22484627 2239790 23788671 20157318 21058334 22885924 25673412 10232643 24713655 24728292 24518929 24762786 22395454 19430483 22955989 16136080 20724581 16984520 18071080 20139978 19057666 17701901 14621324 19561590 18200600 21833088 23202124 21398525 22139419 20981092 21167468 21142536 21293137 17494056 25673413 22504420 24438232 25597830 22885922 21647602 20601685 22456663 16227121 20889312 17875489 19576300
26367794	Whole-genome sequencing identifies EN1 as a determinant of bone density and fracture.	The extent to which low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) between 1-5%) and rare (MAF ≤ 1%) variants contribute to complex traits and disease in the general population is mainly unknown. Bone mineral density (BMD) is highly heritable, a major predictor of osteoporotic fractures, and has been previously associated with common genetic variants, as well as rare, population-specific, coding variants. Here we identify novel non-coding genetic variants with large effects on BMD (ntotal = 53,236) and fracture (ntotal = 508,253) in individuals of European ancestry from the general population. Associations for BMD were derived from whole-genome sequencing (n = 2,882 from UK10K (ref. 10); a population-based genome sequencing consortium), whole-exome sequencing (n = 3,549), deep imputation of genotyped samples using a combined UK10K/1000 Genomes reference panel (n = 26,534), and de novo replication genotyping (n = 20,271). We identified a low-frequency non-coding variant near a novel locus, EN1, with an effect size fourfold larger than the mean of previously reported common variants for lumbar spine BMD (rs11692564(T), MAF = 1.6%, replication effect size = +0.20 s.d., Pmeta = 2 × 10(-14)), which was also associated with a decreased risk of fracture (odds ratio = 0.85; P = 2 × 10(-11); ncases = 98,742 and ncontrols = 409,511). Using an En1(cre/flox) mouse model, we observed that conditional loss of En1 results in low bone mass, probably as a consequence of high bone turnover. We also identified a novel low-frequency non-coding variant with large effects on BMD near WNT16 (rs148771817(T), MAF = 1.2%, replication effect size = +0.41 s.d., Pmeta = 1 × 10(-11)). In general, there was an excess of association signals arising from deleterious coding and conserved non-coding variants. These findings provide evidence that low-frequency non-coding variants have large effects on BMD and fracture, thereby providing rationale for whole-genome sequencing and improved imputation reference panels to study the genetic architecture of complex traits and disease in the general population.	 16319118 19474294 9536315 23128226 20164292 22319458 9315901 25807286 17537797 7624797 22805710 24212883 8684466 20509871 25722852 22792071 19801982 22641211 22792070 20200990 15242796 21533022 23644456 21152010 18445777 22426310 19249006 22495300 21737059 24676807 19079262 25306233 19451168 22504420 20562413 25807282 18455228

26440539	Genome-wide meta-analysis reveals common splice site acceptor variant in CHRNA4 associated with nicotine dependence.	We conducted a 1000 Genomes-imputed genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for nicotine dependence, defined by the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence in 17 074 ever smokers from five European-ancestry samples. We followed up novel variants in 7469 ever smokers from five independent European-ancestry samples. We identified genome-wide significant association in the alpha-4 nicotinic receptor subunit (CHRNA4) gene on chromosome 20q13: lowest P=8.0 × 10(-9) across all the samples for rs2273500-C (frequency=0.15; odds ratio=1.12 and 95% confidence interval=1.08-1.17 for severe vs mild dependence). rs2273500-C, a splice site acceptor variant resulting in an alternate CHRNA4 transcript predicted to be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay, was associated with decreased CHRNA4 expression in physiologically normal human brains (lowest P=7.3 × 10(-4)). Importantly, rs2273500-C was associated with increased lung cancer risk (N=28 998, odds ratio=1.06 and 95% confidence interval=1.00-1.12), likely through its effect on smoking, as rs2273500-C was no longer associated with lung cancer after adjustment for smoking. Using criteria for smoking behavior that encompass more than the single 'cigarettes per day' item, we identified a common CHRNA4 variant with important regulatory properties that contributes to nicotine dependence and smoking-related consequences.	 17768273 20418890 22006218 23298696 11768187 11315092 21683344 21991893 16820547 22832964 24948709 19165921 21445957 25985429 22384356 10835412 22309839 23752247 17254406 8717040 20718045 19628476 1604710 12875050 19819424 18067032 20529013 18385676 735910 18978787 20584212 24665060 22899653 21498873 24143882 19290018 22534784 24316576 20418888 1732720 11039572 16784338 18065163 20616382 1932883 18385738 22524403 20517342 17503330 21811115 23037950 20233392 23715323 24880342 24385388 23334152 18385739 15528443 18538025 22039074 19259974 17712039 24166409 23958962 10882784 17135278 20634204 26952864 15154117 20418889 17701901 21795541 23350800 21848658 23269371 25174004 18534558 20147036 18243582 18723036 17357068 12713636 21983786 19305408 19836008 9089846 15790597 20214461 25954001 18834313 17158188
26443449	Large-scale association analysis in Asians identifies new susceptibility loci for prostate cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ∼100 genetic loci associated with prostate cancer risk. Less than a dozen of these loci were initially identified from GWAS in two Asian populations, likely because of smaller sample sizes of these individual GWAS in Asians. Here, we conduct a large-scale meta-analysis of two GWAS from the Japanese population (1,583 cases and 3,386 controls) and the Chinese population (1,417 cases and 1,008 controls), followed by replication in three independent sample sets. We identify two independent susceptibility loci for prostate cancer at 11p15.4 (rs12791447, P=3.59 × 10(-8); PPFIBP2) and 14q23.2 (rs58262369, P=6.05 × 10(-10); ESR2). The mRNA levels of PPFIBP2 and ESR2 are differentially expressed in prostate tumours and paired normal tissues. Our study adds two new loci to the limited number of prostate cancer risk-associated variants in Asians and provides important insight into potential biological mechanisms of prostate cancer. 	 11371645 17982410 15297300 15860364 17261752 22718278 23173617 23464444 23737527 23932716 24013639 17401363 25217961 17924963 18301783 19543373 19654868 20062813 20509871 20676098 21296855 21207424 22064851 22114074 22366784 22955989 23023329 22923026 10695593 24038036 24296704 24185611 24740154 24762786 24859835 15187231

26482880	A genome-wide association study confirms PNPLA3 and identifies TM6SF2 and MBOAT7 as risk loci for alcohol-related cirrhosis.	Alcohol misuse is the leading cause of cirrhosis and the second most common indication for liver transplantation in the Western world. We performed a genome-wide association study for alcohol-related cirrhosis in individuals of European descent (712 cases and 1,426 controls) with subsequent validation in two independent European cohorts (1,148 cases and 922 controls). We identified variants in the MBOAT7 (P = 1.03 × 10(-9)) and TM6SF2 (P = 7.89 × 10(-10)) genes as new risk loci and confirmed rs738409 in PNPLA3 as an important risk locus for alcohol-related cirrhosis (P = 1.54 × 10(-48)) at a genome-wide level of significance. These three loci have a role in lipid processing, suggesting that lipid turnover is important in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related cirrhosis. 	 21151127 16862161 22179809 12111919 24917523 24268660 21254182 18705692 22841784 25050709 21735171 19581569 21863215 19931040 21254164 12085369 2059245 19951276 23557869 7018299 24735490 16440362 19946271 19189904 21637794 19483685 25060292 22296091 18772128 24946282 17632509 20034933 20202923 7475591 18820647 17554300 20634204 25964223 23511777 25251399 8986199 23712313 24978903 24670599 21399635 19543373 21423719 12756241 24531328
26482879	Multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of 21,000 cases and 95,000 controls identifies new risk loci for atopic dermatitis.	Genetic association studies have identified 21 loci associated with atopic dermatitis risk predominantly in populations of European ancestry. To identify further susceptibility loci for this common, complex skin disease, we performed a meta-analysis of >15 million genetic variants in 21,399 cases and 95,464 controls from populations of European, African, Japanese and Latino ancestry, followed by replication in 32,059 cases and 228,628 controls from 18 studies. We identified ten new risk loci, bringing the total number of known atopic dermatitis risk loci to 31 (with new secondary signals at four of these loci). Notably, the new loci include candidate genes with roles in the regulation of innate host defenses and T cell function, underscoring the important contribution of (auto)immune mechanisms to atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. 	 23817571 23582566 24074861 24632714 24830394 24854591 24388013 25006719 23886662 24141362 24316577 24390342 24880632 25574825 22243446 22955616 22955828 22941192 23042114 23128233 23143594 23104008 22748696 14997420 15482492 7751469 9579538 15710983 16542358 16550169 17660816 17660817 18006846 17967903 18385500 18337720 19349984 19426955 19501237 20032318 20714348 20860503 20930145 20944595 21030306 21666691 21814517 21833088 21618601 21804548 21762976 21907864 21962505 21980299 21991953 22036096 22125221 22197932 22075330 22149933 22426310 22409986 22410365 22753944 23610432 23406875 23727859 23749187 23817569

26488411	Genome-Wide Association Study of Peripheral Arterial Disease in a Japanese Population.	Characteristics of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are the occlusion or stenosis of multiple vessel sites caused mainly by atherosclerosis and chronic lower limb ischemia. To identify PAD susceptible loci, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 785 cases and 3,383 controls in a Japanese population using 431,666 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). After staged analyses including a total of 3,164 cases and 20,134 controls, we identified 3 novel PAD susceptibility loci at IPO5/RAP2A, EDNRA and HDAC9 with genome wide significance (combined P = 6.8 x 10-14, 5.3 x 10-9 and 8.8 x 10-8, respectively). Fine-mapping at the IPO5/RAP2A locus revealed that rs9584669 conferred risk of PAD. Luciferase assay showed that the risk allele at this locus reduced expression levels of IPO5. To our knowledge, these are the first genetic risk factors for PAD. 	 19298919 17982410 20805624 21164079 21959305 21873417 22306652 22286173 22733336 23202125 23288173 23449258 23752268 10532691 10707913 10826501 11501945 12021592 12202037 14993193 15052270 15071432 15280343 2853725 8001384 9114010 16280126 16820593 16862161 16928729 17223489 17617392 16545667 18562802 17701901 17786239 23915883 24262325 24168751 9271386 9826706 10393673 10433505 10487491 15297300 15798178 16403930 19748488
26486471	Genome-wide association studies identify genetic loci for low von Willebrand factor levels.	Low von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels are associated with bleeding symptoms and are a diagnostic criterion for von Willebrand disease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder. To date, it is unclear which genetic loci are associated with reduced VWF levels. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to identify genetic loci associated with low VWF levels. For this meta-analysis, we included 31 149 participants of European ancestry from 11 community-based studies. From all participants, VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) measurements and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scans were available. Each study conducted analyses using logistic regression of SNPs on dichotomized VWF:Ag measures (lowest 5% for blood group O and non-O) with an additive genetic model adjusted for age and sex. An inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was performed for VWF:Ag levels. A total of 97 SNPs exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10(-8) and comprised five loci on four different chromosomes: 6q24 (smallest P-value 5.8 × 10(-10)), 9q34 (2.4 × 10(-64)), 12p13 (5.3 × 10(-22)), 12q23 (1.2 × 10(-8)) and 13q13 (2.6 × 10(-8)). All loci were within or close to genes, including STXBP5 (Syntaxin Binding Protein 5) (6q24), STAB5 (stabilin-5) (12q23), ABO (9q34), VWF (12p13) and UFM1 (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) (13q13). Of these, UFM1 has not been previously associated with VWF:Ag levels. Four genes that were previously associated with VWF levels (VWF, ABO, STXBP5 and STAB2) were also associated with low VWF levels, and, in addition, we identified a new gene, UFM1, that is associated with low VWF levels. These findings point to novel mechanisms for the occurrence of low VWF levels.	 20231535 18604267 8440408 21343614 16297768 20031568 20940418 25832887 17255346 23267103 2646917 16286603 10646227 16371117 24921187 18315614 17572673 15662616 22257027 21156930 17676998 16617122 17903294 10727435 21977987 16889557 12356629 22792389 18760389 7823669 12457784 18245665 17190853 20008188 17955331 21342431 15071506 18347221 20303064 18499864 16985174 11855950 18441336 14819398

26502338	Genetic association analyses implicate aberrant regulation of innate and adaptive immunity genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a genetically complex autoimmune disease characterized by loss of immune tolerance to nuclear and cell surface antigens. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had modest sample sizes, reducing their scope and reliability. Our study comprised 7,219 cases and 15,991 controls of European ancestry, constituting a new GWAS, a meta-analysis with a published GWAS and a replication study. We have mapped 43 susceptibility loci, including ten new associations. Assisted by dense genome coverage, imputation provided evidence for missense variants underpinning associations in eight genes. Other likely causal genes were established by examining associated alleles for cis-acting eQTL effects in a range of ex vivo immune cells. We found an over-representation (n = 16) of transcription factors among SLE susceptibility genes. This finding supports the view that aberrantly regulated gene expression networks in multiple cell types in both the innate and adaptive immune response contribute to the risk of developing SLE. 	 18204098 11315092 15716906 22941192 25205108 12574333 16862161 21738483 22586164 12115187 17529978 23128226 22046141 21374718 20827270 24844982 20369022 18668569 23614478 22291604 3430520 25024389 1536669 14734616 21978998 19333953 23104008 17572673 21336280 12765974 20169177 23965942 20213807 15818688 25640675 22904263 11984006 20517342 22446964 23441136 18852200 15262106 23298838 23874208 21556132 24604202 24023392 15052270 22203994 16170323 23950893 19165918 23042117 17554300 19838193 25620976 24130510 20548291 18204446 24094745 21087477 23970121 11119293 23264341 21300701 22972472 21614020 18642345 19838195 14500783 21326321 24702955 23084292 18987646 24534757 21622776 24013639 24786080
26503763	Genome-wide association study identifies SESTD1 as a novel risk gene for lithium-responsive bipolar disorder.	Lithium is the mainstay prophylactic treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), but treatment response varies considerably across individuals. Patients who respond well to lithium treatment might represent a relatively homogeneous subtype of this genetically and phenotypically diverse disorder. Here, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify (i) specific genetic variations influencing lithium response and (ii) genetic variants associated with risk for lithium-responsive BD. Patients with BD and controls were recruited from Sweden and the United Kingdom. GWAS were performed on 2698 patients with subjectively defined (self-reported) lithium response and 1176 patients with objectively defined (clinically documented) lithium response. We next conducted GWAS comparing lithium responders with healthy controls (1639 subjective responders and 8899 controls; 323 objective responders and 6684 controls). Meta-analyses of Swedish and UK results revealed no significant associations with lithium response within the bipolar subjects. However, when comparing lithium-responsive patients with controls, two imputed markers attained genome-wide significant associations, among which one was validated in confirmatory genotyping (rs116323614, P=2.74 × 10(-8)). It is an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 2q31.2 in the gene SEC14 and spectrin domains 1 (SESTD1), which encodes a protein involved in regulation of phospholipids. Phospholipids have been strongly implicated as lithium treatment targets. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of variance for lithium-responsive BD explained by common variants ('SNP heritability') as 0.25 and 0.29 using two definitions of lithium response. Our results revealed a genetic variant in SESTD1 associated with risk for lithium-responsive BD, suggesting that the understanding of BD etiology could be furthered by focusing on this subtype of BD.	 6253491 19087329 23974872 22384356 19448189 22384280 25661398 24806176 12858178 16025419 23128226 21926972 23212060 10826655 15927087 22457348 23212456 24238631 16787706 19915572 23070075 24369049 24210625 11869775 2553271 21961650 16469785 8016062 23472710 2670240 11099736 8707997 24705630 9165384 8217062 19691823 16538178 11018218 16176433 12720476 7150264 17442400 21037240 18189280 19426162 19571808 19018715 19010359 15836800 21047205 3024627 23663951 10789877 11734659 20712826 12845409 15728426 25532077 10071717 17701901 19018930 20667171 22384149 21492946 12680900 21167468 14668438 21361856 19026269 12015604 16449479 12416605 17486107 23663953 20164195
26503584	Identification of four new susceptibility loci for testicular germ cell tumour.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk loci for testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT), revealing a polygenic model of disease susceptibility strongly influenced by common variation. To identify additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with TGCT, we conducted a multistage GWAS with a combined data set of >25,000 individuals (6,059 cases and 19,094 controls). We identified new risk loci for TGCT at 3q23 (rs11705932, TFDP2, P=1.5 × 10(-9)), 11q14.1 (rs7107174, GAB2, P=9.7 × 10(-11)), 16p13.13 (rs4561483, GSPT1, P=1.6 × 10(-8)) and 16q24.2 (rs55637647, ZFPM1, P=3.4 × 10(-9)). We additionally present detailed functional analysis of these loci, identifying a statistically significant relationship between rs4561483 risk genotype and increased GSPT1 expression in TGCT patient samples. These findings provide additional support for a polygenic model of TGCT risk and further insight into the biological basis of disease development. 	 23607741 17895893 24369860 16110032 25598472 24607859 2511002 19963113 25029990 12213678 21779441 22871571 25281660 15987717 12865429 23666239 22064851 19903067 22138821 19483681 22432056 23535722 22820512 16306258 18231617 19969558 23535730 24943593 20543847 23535732 15749075 15208620 20517342 26349679 21551455 19557077 23535731 20435672 21357174 11150246 19483682 17031378 23395239 11337480 18715499 25609015 23666240 11230178 24120139 21623831 25877299 8703054 12239108 9413462 23535729 16873377 11984562 25208325 19424636 16224025
26516778	Drug-Gene Interactions of Antihypertensive Medications and Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease: A Pharmacogenomics Study from the CHARGE Consortium.	Hypertension is a major risk factor for a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke. In the US, over 65 million people have high blood pressure and a large proportion of these individuals are prescribed antihypertensive medications. Although large long-term clinical trials conducted in the last several decades have identified a number of effective antihypertensive treatments that reduce the risk of future clinical complications, responses to therapy and protection from cardiovascular events vary among individuals.	 21444836 20066004 22566498 23087401 23202125 23690342 23753411 24192120 23400010 24612202 11926892 12479764 15199039 8686689 9366618 9750244 10201655 21156931 21052022 11315092 10366179 10463718 15967849 17676998 19089453 19389317 19491196 20031568 20616382 21058334 21909115
26519441	Genetic Influences on Plasma Homocysteine Levels in African Americans and Yoruba Nigerians.	Plasma homocysteine, a metabolite involved in key cellular methylation processes seems to be implicated in cognitive functions and cardiovascular health with its high levels representing a potential modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. A better understanding of the genetic factors regulating homocysteine levels, particularly in non-white populations, may help in risk stratification analyses of existing clinical trials and may point to novel targets for homocysteine-lowering therapy. To identify genetic influences on plasma homocysteine levels in individuals with African ancestry, we performed a targeted gene and pathway-based analysis using a priori biological information and then to identify new association performed a genome-wide association study. All analyses used combined data from the African American and Yoruba cohorts from the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project. Targeted analyses demonstrated significant associations of homocysteine and variants within the CBS (Cystathionine beta-Synthase) gene. We identified a novel genome-wide significant association of the AD risk gene CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) with plasma homocysteine levels in both cohorts. Minor allele (T) carriers of identified CD2AP variant (rs6940729) exhibited decreased homocysteine level. Pathway enrichment analysis identified several interesting pathways including the GABA receptor activation pathway. This is noteworthy given the known antagonistic effect of homocysteine on GABA receptors. These findings identify several new targets warranting further investigation in relation to the role of homocysteine in neurodegeneration. 	 20885792 21460841 12918012 25201007 23836404 23647314 26194313 16043881 20046406 17850795 18252751 15184599 24973918 25147783 20501604 12083806 23419831 21524430 10995836 23157378 10341291 16274669 25664013 22886392 19453410 18843658 20154341 17645628 22159054 17284751 9741631 19308943 12559036 23571809 23226438 15297300 17636160 20659431 21460840 15975077 22589738 24816252 22648509 16275737 12217865 20843952 12689599 25887956 24162737 11844848 23608917 15362248 24067533 17576866 25444607 17701901 23824729 9159176 18406095 7542590 21512418 18348202 26182429 23251661 19157246 16583434 15882553 23894628 9844033 8602585 12672817 14584018 22691495 21784352 23899991 22480918 11333847 24565289 17030070 19303062 12477704 23571587
26632684	Genome-wide Meta-analysis on the Sense of Smell Among US Older Adults.	Olfactory dysfunction is common among older adults and affects their safety, nutrition, quality of life, and mortality. More importantly, the decreased sense of smell is an early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease. However, the genetic determinants for the sense of smell have been poorly investigated. We here performed the first genome-wide meta-analysis on the sense of smell among 6252 US older adults of European descent from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, and the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). Genome-wide association study analysis was performed first by individual cohorts and then meta-analyzed using fixed-effect models with inverse variance weights. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide statistical significance, we identified 13 loci with suggestive evidence for an association with the sense of smell (Pmeta < 1 × 10). Of these, 2 SNPs at chromosome 17q21.31 (rs199443 in NSF, P = 3.02 × 10; and rs2732614 in KIAA1267-LRRC37A, P = 6.65 × 10) exhibited cis effects on the expression of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, 17q21.31) in 447 frontal-cortex samples obtained postmortem and profiled by RNA-seq (P < 1 × 10). Gene-based and pathway-enrichment analyses further implicated MAPT in regulating the sense of smell in older adults. Similar results were obtained after excluding participants who reported a physician-diagnosed PD or use of PD medications. In conclusion, we provide preliminary evidence that the MAPT locus may play a role in regulating the sense of smell in older adults and therefore offer a potential genetic link between poor sense of smell and major neurodegenerative diseases.	 12425708 17239830 20173747 23022896 20485568 25064009 19214830 2646917 8614203 23948901 14507342 18619712 17961138 18067173 18245794 24570664 20616382 15053964 16103727 26301688 16991138 21553300 20598278 20233392 24514572 12730696 19686220 23845000 15804503 22955989 17701901 22471860 15293269 11642433 20010835 18612115 17342154 12498954 20923931 21639645 20220756 2021470
26414677	Large-scale genomic analyses link reproductive aging to hypothalamic signaling, breast cancer susceptibility and BRCA1-mediated DNA repair.	Menopause timing has a substantial impact on infertility and risk of disease, including breast cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We report a dual strategy in ∼70,000 women to identify common and low-frequency protein-coding variation associated with age at natural menopause (ANM). We identified 44 regions with common variants, including two regions harboring additional rare missense alleles of large effect. We found enrichment of signals in or near genes involved in delayed puberty, highlighting the first molecular links between the onset and end of reproductive lifespan. Pathway analyses identified major association with DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including the first common coding variant in BRCA1 associated with any complex trait. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal effect of later ANM on breast cancer risk (∼6% increase in risk per year; P = 3 × 10(-14)), likely mediated by prolonged sex hormone exposure rather than DDR mechanisms. 	 21909115 24119843 18664458 23221638 19471299 25480036 20714348 23128226 12707859 23650335 25056061 25316443 19631481 24670763 24127939 21993624 25428361 24357391 22820512 22267201 20616382 20935630 20126254 23535732 23973388 23453885 15164064 26414676 15297300 10334989 19557189 17213823 23084519 25437880 23408054 26414678 22194613 18614256 25231870 23263488 25165823 24108124 24974252 12099629 17701901 22920291 21406551 24885574 24084921 21167468 24973796 18443323 18166824 19996028 25519381 23535729 22494951 18172190 24081944
26434682	Genetic variants in PLCB4/PLCB1 as susceptibility loci for coronary artery aneurysm formation in Kawasaki disease in Han Chinese in Taiwan.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute, inflammatory, and self-limited vasculitis affecting infants and young children. Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) formation is the major complication of KD and the leading cause of acquired cardiovascular disease among children. To identify susceptible loci that might predispose patients with KD to CAA formation, a genome-wide association screen was performed in a Taiwanese KD cohort. Patients with both KD and CAA had longer fever duration and delayed intravenous immunoglobulin treatment time. After adjusting for these factors, 100 susceptibility loci were identified. Four genes were identified from a single cluster of 35 using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Knowledge Base. Silencing KCNQ5, PLCB1, PLCB4, and PLCL1 inhibited the effect of lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial cell inflammation with varying degrees of proinflammatory cytokine expression. PLCB1 showed the most significant inhibition. Endothelial cell inflammation was also inhibited by using a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs6140791 was identified between PLCB4 and PLCB1. Plasma PLC levels were higher in patients with KD and CC+CG rs6140791genotypes, and these genotypes were more prevalent in patients with KD who also had CAA. Our results suggest that polymorphism of the PLCB4/B1 genes might be involved in the CAA pathogenesis of KD. 	 23677057 15486121 16282773 15900570 22446961 11270190 23522327 17413867 3045562 18084290 20171262 18621420 15574639 24278430 21815799 14715193 22645426 20618519 1860206 23998245 22446962 23089395 25192965 24069052 1447658 21160486 15302199 1432415 25045363 21148417 8822996 21326860 19132087 22012123 20626023 25039043 12442017 22081228 23647775 15611368 18976687 1709446 19180512 2113446 16344617 19710093 21221998 2480498 23454411 9490656 15164145 3491174 24268062 9128808 18062909
26525574	Dense genotyping of immune-related loci identifies HLA variants associated with increased risk of collagenous colitis.	Collagenous colitis (CC) is a major cause of chronic non-bloody diarrhoea, particularly in the elderly female population. The aetiology of CC is unknown, and still poor is the understanding of its pathogenesis. This possibly involves dysregulated inflammation and immune-mediated reactions in genetically predisposed individuals, but the contribution of genetic factors to CC is underinvestigated. We systematically tested immune-related genes known to impact the risk of several autoimmune diseases for their potential CC-predisposing role.	
26528553	Genome-Wide Association Studies of the Human Gut Microbiota.	The bacterial composition of the human fecal microbiome is influenced by many lifestyle factors, notably diet. It is less clear, however, what role host genetics plays in dictating the composition of bacteria living in the gut. In this study, we examined the association of ~200K host genotypes with the relative abundance of fecal bacterial taxa in a founder population, the Hutterites, during two seasons (n = 91 summer, n = 93 winter, n = 57 individuals collected in both). These individuals live and eat communally, minimizing variation due to environmental exposures, including diet, which could potentially mask small genetic effects. Using a GWAS approach that takes into account the relatedness between subjects, we identified at least 8 bacterial taxa whose abundances were associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the host genome in each season (at genome-wide FDR of 20%). For example, we identified an association between a taxon known to affect obesity (genus Akkermansia) and a variant near PLD1, a gene previously associated with body mass index. Moreover, we replicate a previously reported association from a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study of fecal microbiome abundance in mice (genus Lactococcus, rs3747113, P = 3.13 x 10-7). Finally, based on the significance distribution of the associated microbiome QTLs in our study with respect to chromatin accessibility profiles, we identified tissues in which host genetic variation may be acting to influence bacterial abundance in the gut. 	 25417156 23977141 23932459 20566857 9245781 24736369 20937875 10702282 9720761 15505215 20562875 10630441 22286170 20722058 20679230 17640961 23692866 17183312 19865183 11990498 17189447 23831042 15877898 19124843 23044767 16188921 18725973 19430479 25203169 17012356 12883005 22955983 17265126 22422004 21219177 20376150 23768550 17631127 1592209 334036 18160481 22699611 23804561 18401439 25424715 23671105 20110278 10079528 18033837 18403759 23401498 19478349 25587358 24618913 21701570 17554300 16849736 19783480 22781100 18776909 12119664 2181501 16432374 19801464 20360734 15133062 19396169 14766966 22955828 19740713 19805227 20181275 16954244 18936492 22706312 19043404
26545240	Genetic Determinants of Pelvic Organ Prolapse among African American and Hispanic Women in the Women's Health Initiative.	Current evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology to pelvic organ prolapse (POP), including genetic predisposition. We conducted a genome-wide association study of POP in African American (AA) and Hispanic (HP) women from the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Therapy study. Cases were defined as any POP (grades 1-3) or moderate/severe POP (grades 2-3), while controls had grade 0 POP. We performed race-specific multiple logistic regression analyses between SNPs imputed to 1000 genomes in relation to POP (grade 0 vs 1-3; grade 0 vs 2-3) adjusting for age at diagnosis, body mass index, parity, and genetic ancestry. There were 1274 controls and 1427 cases of any POP and 317 cases of moderate/severe POP. Although none of the analyses reached genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8), we noted variants in several loci that met p<10-6. In race-specific analysis of grade 0 vs 2-3, intronic SNPs in the CPE gene (rs28573326, OR:2.14; 95% CI 1.62-2.83; p = 1.0x10-7) were associated with POP in AAs, and SNPs in the gene AL132709.5 (rs1950626, OR:2.96; 95% CI 1.96-4.48, p = 2.6x10-7) were associated with POP in HPs. Inverse variance fixed-effect meta-analysis of the race-specific results showed suggestive signals for SNPs in the DPP6 gene (rs11243354, OR:1.36; p = 4.2x10-7) in the grade 0 vs 1-3 analyses and for SNPs around PGBD5 (rs740494, OR:2.17; p = 8.6x10-7) and SHC3 (rs2209875, OR:0.60; p = 9.3x10-7) in the grade 0 vs 2-3 analyses. While we did not identify genome-wide significant findings, we document several SNPs reaching suggestive statistical significance. Further interrogation of POP in larger minority samples is warranted. 	 24807341 19935029 17540813 14575944 17400845 24721264 17138771 22384356 18350241 9492970 22890278 22125221 22038928 22064851 10192487 19444361 9207799 22138821 25557205 17572673 19104363 21565292 14575939 20144500 11462236 18084291 22342894 22985128 22105264 18799443 18987618 11490245 23406875 18057069 22914468 23715323 7663508 17021862 23200709 23190018 21826085 12066091 20223449 20686608 17701901 18776909 25974730 19543373 23933894
26542096	Meta-analysis identifies seven susceptibility loci involved in the atopic march.	Eczema often precedes the development of asthma in a disease course called the 'atopic march'. To unravel the genes underlying this characteristic pattern of allergic disease, we conduct a multi-stage genome-wide association study on infantile eczema followed by childhood asthma in 12 populations including 2,428 cases and 17,034 controls. Here we report two novel loci specific for the combined eczema plus asthma phenotype, which are associated with allergic disease for the first time; rs9357733 located in EFHC1 on chromosome 6p12.3 (OR 1.27; P=2.1 × 10(-8)) and rs993226 between TMTC2 and SLC6A15 on chromosome 12q21.3 (OR 1.58; P=5.3 × 10(-9)). Additional susceptibility loci identified at genome-wide significance are FLG (1q21.3), IL4/KIF3A (5q31.1), AP5B1/OVOL1 (11q13.1), C11orf30/LRRC32 (11q13.5) and IKZF3 (17q21). We show that predominantly eczema loci increase the risk for the atopic march. Our findings suggest that eczema may play an important role in the development of asthma after eczema. 	 22409988 22955616 22839963 22475622 23095804 23445315 16839746 17030239 24117677 24251558 24332221 24670764 24722477 24560412 24388013 24764305 25176965 25282559 25282563 25282564 25335105 25318072 25348401 25693563 25433406 17052480 17159113 17417636 17611496 17194218 17628647 17655920 17634063 17845409 17692428 18325573 18505993 18974171 19029000 19147686 19349984 19543373 19839980 19817751 19793062 20460624 23486430 23817569 24023709 24037378 23845860 24316577 10877330 15052270 15258581 9541491 15670853 16550169 20372189 20670812 20674819 20616382 20860503 20673980 21058334 21521612 21429916 21458851 22036096 22197932

26553974	Polymorphisms of large effect explain the majority of the host genetic contribution to variation of HIV-1 virus load.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of HIV-1-infected populations have been underpowered to detect common variants with moderate impact on disease outcome and have not assessed the phenotypic variance explained by genome-wide additive effects. By combining the majority of available genome-wide genotyping data in HIV-infected populations, we tested for association between ∼8 million variants and viral load (HIV RNA copies per milliliter of plasma) in 6,315 individuals of European ancestry. The strongest signal of association was observed in the HLA class I region that was fully explained by independent effects mapping to five variable amino acid positions in the peptide binding grooves of the HLA-B and HLA-A proteins. We observed a second genome-wide significant association signal in the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (CCR) gene cluster on chromosome 3. Conditional analysis showed that this signal could not be fully attributed to the known protective CCR5Δ32 allele and the risk P1 haplotype, suggesting further causal variants in this region. Heritability analysis demonstrated that common human genetic variation-mostly in the HLA and CCR5 regions-explains 25% of the variability in viral load. This study suggests that analyses in non-European populations and of variant classes not assessed by GWAS should be priorities for the field going forward. 	 24653038 9836644 24939907 25439723 19107206 19115949 19543373 19754311 20041166 20064070 20205591 20562875 20811451 10073943 10518566 15602133 16862161 17701901 17641165 25038359 21058334 21051598 21167468 20517342 21502085 21811574 22138821 22820512 22718199 23269371 23559252 23762245 23935489 24171102 10694578 12499305 7887550 8791590 9252328 9742978 18852200
26561523	A meta-analysis of 120 246 individuals identifies 18 new loci for fibrinogen concentration.	Genome-wide association studies have previously identified 23 genetic loci associated with circulating fibrinogen concentration. These studies used HapMap imputation and did not examine the X-chromosome. 1000 Genomes imputation provides better coverage of uncommon variants, and includes indels. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis of 34 studies imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel and including ∼120 000 participants of European ancestry (95 806 participants with data on the X-chromosome). Approximately 10.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 1.2 million indels were examined. We identified 41 genome-wide significant fibrinogen loci; of which, 18 were newly identified. There were no genome-wide significant signals on the X-chromosome. The lead variants of five significant loci were indels. We further identified six additional independent signals, including three rare variants, at two previously characterized loci: FGB and IRF1. Together the 41 loci explain 3% of the variance in plasma fibrinogen concentration. 	 23034020 16219884 23643377 23701042 23969696 24013639 23908464 23953347 23897841 24316577 24385918 24510500 24396070 24509480 25256095 25551457 25557604 25814643 26105150 18605954 18070814 26386597 19543373 19715440 20031568 20031576 10688828 10747348 11019970 11197396 10048763 16415888 17502367 20031577 20126254 20160724 20388777 20509871 20616382 20601685 21075354 21058334 21104887 21059949 21167468 20978265 21267061 22037947 22064851 22426310 22593463 22293688 22955616 15795540 15728204 23128226
26566055	Genome-wide association study identifies candidate loci associated with postoperative fentanyl requirements after laparoscopic-assisted colectomy.	Opioids are widely used as effective analgesics, but opioid sensitivity is well known to vary widely among individuals and the underlying genetic factors are not fully understood, thus hampering efficient pain treatment. We explored the genetic factors that contribute to individual differences in opioid sensitivity by performing a genome-wide association study.	
26531332	Genome-wide association study with the risk of schizophrenia in a Korean population.	Schizophrenia is regarded as a multifactorial and polygenic brain disorder that is attributed to different combinations of genetic and environmental risk factors. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia have identified numerous risk factors, but the replication results remain controversial and ambiguous. To identify schizophrenia susceptibility loci in the Korean population, we performed a GWAS using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad V1.0 Microarray. We genotyped 1,140,419 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 350 Korea schizophrenia patients and 700 control subjects, and approximately 620,001 autosomal SNPs were passed our quality control. In the case-control analysis, the rs9607195 A>G on intergenic area 250 kb away from the ISX gene and the rs12738007 A>G on the intron of the MECR gene were the most strongly associated SNPs with the risk of schizophrenia (P = 6.2 × 10(-8) , OR = 0.50 and P = 3.7 × 10(-7) , OR = 2.39, respectively). In subsequent fine-mapping analysis, 6 SNPs of MECR were genotyped with 310 schizophrenia patients and 604 control subjects. The association of the MECR rs12738007, a top ranked-SNP in GWAS, was replicated (P = 1.5 × 10(-2) , OR = 1.53 in fine mapping analysis, P = 1.5 × 10(-6) , OR = 1.90 in combined analysis). The identification of putative schizophrenia susceptibility loci could provide new insights into genetic factors related with schizophrenia and clues for the development of diagnosis strategies.	
26569114	Genome-Wide Association Study of Staphylococcus aureus Carriage in a Community-Based Sample of Mexican-Americans in Starr County, Texas.	Staphylococcus aureus is the number one cause of hospital-acquired infections. Understanding host pathogen interactions is paramount to the development of more effective treatment and prevention strategies. Therefore, whole exome sequence and chip-based genotype data were used to conduct rare variant and genome-wide association analyses in a Mexican-American cohort from Starr County, Texas to identify genes and variants associated with S. aureus nasal carriage. Unlike most studies of S. aureus that are based on hospitalized populations, this study used a representative community sample. Two nasal swabs were collected from participants (n = 858) 11-17 days apart between October 2009 and December 2013, screened for the presence of S. aureus, and then classified as either persistent, intermittent, or non-carriers. The chip-based and exome sequence-based single variant association analyses identified 1 genome-wide significant region (KAT2B) for intermittent and 11 regions suggestively associated with persistent or intermittent S. aureus carriage. We also report top findings from gene-based burden analyses of rare functional variation. Notably, we observed marked differences between signals associated with persistent and intermittent carriage. In single variant analyses of persistent carriage, 7 of 9 genes in suggestively associated regions and all 5 top gene-based findings are associated with cell growth or tight junction integrity or are structural constituents of the cytoskeleton, suggesting that variation in genes associated with persistent carriage impact cellular integrity and morphology. 	 19696144 24913064 1169157 23760207 24124411 20818381 22384255 20962590 17194218 23836555 1987042 23619097 20849532 12946328 22996348 18974303 24331461 18464913 23204181 20947786 24036537 16406780 15296513 15576197 19419332 24847357 25585593 15681147 25282101 10543402 21909648 15286728 24820650 18710924 11687441 23772378 22764253 16730966 21393420 19411183 25492858 24332264 7826020 15539529 22138821 17507668 11336673 24771430 23862583 22384213 17572673 15473844 21739576 24837662 23193289 22820512 16001361 14672952 25071153 18422436 19996091 21480479 17498209 24503127 22022564 15472812 25202691 22305687 24823311 23727036 20797700 11313261 24051374 23829686 19805818 24297913 20517342 16757563 21700766 9341175 20677941 16941349 22110782 24677629 12692541 24944246 24524581 25755718 11734766 24509480 24511099 15837108 18178860 25554785 23276707 15107545 1648725 23664528 16697230 9724633 12427098 22818855 22543584 23662806 15716063 10360626 8185146 394667 24612512 23643813 21047774 24412224 25075227 24767728 9288076 21647700 20479083 20634204 24424098 20453838 22915611 24244486 25087226 17701901 25709888 12765336 21833088 11136954 18794290 15855238 23251661 10488166 25434806 16546567 12654860 8756719 21306635 22749353 21127056 22262894 17913546 10586157 23221186 24251807 7844335 15325835 21998436 8253532 12145715 21386985 24464226 16034473 19392622 25333703 9709046 17846124 24376456 21249183
26582766	Genetic Susceptibility to Lipid Levels and Lipid Change Over Time and Risk of Incident Hyperlipidemia in Chinese Populations.

26580837	A genome-wide association study on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Taiwanese Han population.	Identification of mutations in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a genome-wide association study can reveal possible biomarkers of such a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. It was observed that significant single nucleotide polymorphisms vary when the tested population changes from one ethnic group to another. To identify new loci associated with ALS susceptibility in the Taiwanese Han population, we performed a genome-wide association study on 94 patients with sporadic ALS and 376 matched controls. We uncovered two new susceptibility loci at 13q14.3 (rs2785946) and 11q25 (rs11224052). In addition, we analyzed the functions of all the associated genes among 54 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms using Gene Ontology annotations, and the results showed several statistically significant neural- and muscle-related Gene Ontology terms and the associated diseases.	
26584805	A genome-wide association study of n-3 and n-6 plasma fatty acids in a Singaporean Chinese population.	Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a major impact on human health. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic loci that are associated with plasma levels of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in primarily subjects of European ancestry. However, the relevance of these findings has not been evaluated extensively in other ethnic groups. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate for genetic loci associated with n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and to validate the role of recently identified index loci using data from a Singaporean Chinese population. Using a GWAS approach, we evaluated associations with plasma concentrations of three n-3 PUFAs [alphalinolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid], four n-6 PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), gammalinolenic acid, dihomogammalinolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid], and estimates of delta-5 desaturase and delta-6 desaturase activities among the participants (N = 1361) of the Singaporean Chinese Health Study. Our results reveal robust genome-wide associations (p value <5 × 10(-8)) with ALA, all four n-6 PUFAs, and delta-6 desaturase activity at the FADS1/FADS2 locus. We further replicated the associations between common index variants at the NTAN1/PDXDC1 locus and n-6 PUFAs LA and DGLA, and between the JMJD1C locus and n-6 PUFA LA (p value between 0.0490 and 9.88 × 10(-4)). These associations were independent of dietary intake of PUFAs. In aggregate, we show that genetic loci that influence plasma concentrations of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs are shared across different ethnic groups. 	 23726366 16862161 25124495 18712989 11759279 11948270 20227258 17572673 22286219 20686565 23794360 24823311 18936223 21829377 19712485 19820697 16825676 23844046 21544081 20634204 17398308 17921425 20562440 9155216 11566644 19148276 25161044 20427696 14685227 18179892 20081858 19357637 10817922
26586795	Common genetic variation and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis: a genome-wide analysis.	Genome-wide association studies have identified several germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. Common germline genetic variation may also be related to CRC survival. We used a discovery-based approach to identify SNPs related to survival outcomes after CRC diagnosis. Genome-wide genotyping arrays were conducted for 3494 individuals with invasive CRC enrolled in six prospective cohort studies (median study-specific follow-up = 4.2-8.1 years). In pooled analyses, we used Cox regression to assess SNP-specific associations with CRC-specific and overall survival, with additional analyses stratified by stage at diagnosis. Top findings were followed-up in independent studies. A P value threshold of P < 5×10(-8) in analyses combining discovery and follow-up studies was required for genome-wide significance. Among individuals with distant-metastatic CRC, several SNPs at 6p12.1, nearest the ELOVL5 gene, were statistically significantly associated with poorer survival, with the strongest associations noted for rs209489 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8, P = 7.6×10(-10) and HR = 1.8, P = 3.7×10(-9) for CRC-specific and overall survival, respectively). No SNPs were statistically significantly associated with survival among all cases combined or in cases without distant-metastases. SNPs in 6p12.1/ELOVL5 were associated with survival outcomes in individuals with distant-metastatic CRC, and merit further follow-up for functional significance. Findings from this genome-wide association study highlight the potential importance of genetic variation in CRC prognosis and provide clues to genomic regions of potential interest. 	 22873481 21641636 23266556 23803379 24703531 24449368 22133576 19671906 19690179 20628028 19696144 20972440 21058334 20978172 21200035 21129217 8988044 9065374 9492970 21655089 18838740 21402474 21910156 21919605 21679251 21761138 10699974 11189683 11189684 11189691 11315092 12015775 14575944 14693663 15365072 15467030 248266 6901582 2664509 1678444 8929264 22580541 16434594 16550164 17290389 17492639 18054576 18372905 19011631 23263487
26870257	Nine susceptibility loci for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma identified by a pilot two-stage genome-wide association study.	Previous studies have indicated that complex interactions among viral, environmental and genetic factors lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To identify susceptibility alleles for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, the present study conducted a pilot two-phase genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 660 Han Chinese individuals. In phase 1, a total of 500,447 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 50 HCC cases and 50 controls using Affymetrix GeneChip 500k Array Set. In phase 2, 1,152 SNPs were selected from phase 1 and genotyped in 282 cases and 278 controls using the Illumina GoldenGate platform. The prior probability of HCC in control subjects was assigned at 0.01, and false-positive report probability (FPRP) was utilized to evaluate the statistical significance.

26604143	Genome-wide association analysis identifies three new susceptibility loci for childhood body mass index.	A large number of genetic loci are associated with adult body mass index. However, the genetics of childhood body mass index are largely unknown. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of childhood body mass index, using sex- and age-adjusted standard deviation scores. We included 35 668 children from 20 studies in the discovery phase and 11 873 children from 13 studies in the replication phase. In total, 15 loci reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5 × 10(-8)) in the joint discovery and replication analysis, of which 12 are previously identified loci in or close to ADCY3, GNPDA2, TMEM18, SEC16B, FAIM2, FTO, TFAP2B, TNNI3K, MC4R, GPR61, LMX1B and OLFM4 associated with adult body mass index or childhood obesity. We identified three novel loci: rs13253111 near ELP3, rs8092503 near RAB27B and rs13387838 near ADAM23. Per additional risk allele, body mass index increased 0.04 Standard Deviation Score (SDS) [Standard Error (SE) 0.007], 0.05 SDS (SE 0.008) and 0.14 SDS (SE 0.025), for rs13253111, rs8092503 and rs13387838, respectively. A genetic risk score combining all 15 SNPs showed that each additional average risk allele was associated with a 0.073 SDS (SE 0.011, P-value = 3.12 × 10(-10)) increase in childhood body mass index in a population of 1955 children. This risk score explained 2% of the variance in childhood body mass index. This study highlights the shared genetic background between childhood and adult body mass index and adds three novel loci. These loci likely represent age-related differences in strength of the associations with body mass index. 	 22645519 18846049 20147714 25044758 18996918 22941192 20888820 25642630 25581432 25953783 12937090 21379325 18057335 11956164 9519560 20616382 20935630 20935629 17384662 20054296 24518671 19752881 23563607 22484627 19185337 24880830 20421936 25673412 25108383 24348519 23251661 22405860 21429053 20702402 25673413 25597830 18663371 20562874 14697522 21971119 15451418 23345460 24013639

26626624	Genome-wide Association Analysis of Psoriatic Arthritis and Cutaneous Psoriasis Reveals Differences in Their Genetic Architecture.	Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) is a common inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease. Up to 30% of people with PsV eventually develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory musculoskeletal condition. To discern differences in genetic risk factors for PsA and cutaneous-only psoriasis (PsC), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,430 PsA case subjects and 1,417 unaffected control subjects. Meta-analysis of this study with three other GWASs and two targeted genotyping studies, encompassing a total of 9,293 PsV case subjects, 3,061 PsA case subjects, 3,110 PsC case subjects, and 13,670 unaffected control subjects of European descent, detected 10 regions associated with PsA and 11 with PsC at genome-wide (GW) significance. Several of these association signals (IFNLR1, IFIH1, NFKBIA for PsA; TNFRSF9, LCE3C/B, TRAF3IP2, IL23A, NFKBIA for PsC) have not previously achieved GW significance. After replication, we also identified a PsV-associated SNP near CDKAL1 (rs4712528, odds ratio [OR] = 1.16, p = 8.4 × 10(-11)). Among identified psoriasis risk variants, three were more strongly associated with PsC than PsA (rs12189871 near HLA-C, p = 5.0 × 10(-19); rs4908742 near TNFRSF9, p = 0.00020; rs10888503 near LCE3A, p = 0.0014), and two were more strongly associated with PsA than PsC (rs12044149 near IL23R, p = 0.00018; rs9321623 near TNFAIP3, p = 0.00022). The PsA-specific variants were independent of previously identified psoriasis variants near IL23R and TNFAIP3. We also found multiple independent susceptibility variants in the IL12B, NOS2, and IFIH1 regions. These results provide insights into the pathogenetic similarities and differences between PsC and PsA.	 25006012 8349859 11830425 25693563 20153665 21107349 24470327 23917628 22482804 20953186 25939698 19587699 23128226 17388919 19554022 6179364 21374718 23574549 20089530 25948071 12499305 22064851 3866077 20953189 19169254 19289445 23925466 15539411 19169255 20953187 19439430 24316577 20331852 21435436 24790463 20436464 23104008 25087609 20953188 17530646 18364390 22820512 12029063 8304761 21242233 22127698 25854761 22125590 17236132 25182136 4747538 20643763 25923216 21613309 19741010 23252691 10323458 21905258 17166285 25903422 24566688 4715537 15757963 11731797 18802076 20953190 17958839 22532629 25651891 21058334 14681465 24076602 21349879 20034760 18923449 21900282 24185760 22955989 24487276 21494239 25723451 21208785 17701901 24441097 22814393 19169253 22170493 26413181 18423522 23401011 21400479 22006066 17728335 20601685 18524791 3735281 23916976 18369459 23143594
26621817	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies common susceptibility polymorphisms for colorectal and endometrial cancer near SH2B3 and TSHZ1.	High-risk mutations in several genes predispose to both colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC). We therefore hypothesised that some lower-risk genetic variants might also predispose to both CRC and EC. Using CRC and EC genome-wide association series, totalling 13,265 cancer cases and 40,245 controls, we found that the protective allele [G] at one previously-identified CRC polymorphism, rs2736100 near TERT, was associated with EC risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, P = 0.000167); this polymorphism influences the risk of several other cancers. A further CRC polymorphism near TERC also showed evidence of association with EC (OR = 0.92; P = 0.03). Overall, however, there was no good evidence that the set of CRC polymorphisms was associated with EC risk, and neither of two previously-reported EC polymorphisms was associated with CRC risk. A combined analysis revealed one genome-wide significant polymorphism, rs3184504, on chromosome 12q24 (OR = 1.10, P = 7.23 × 10(-9)) with shared effects on CRC and EC risk. This polymorphism, a missense variant in the gene SH2B3, is also associated with haematological and autoimmune disorders, suggesting that it influences cancer risk through the immune response. Another polymorphism, rs12970291 near gene TSHZ1, was associated with both CRC and EC (OR = 1.26, P = 4.82 × 10(-8)), with the alleles showing opposite effects on the risks of the two cancers.	 23955597 24768677 25487306 10072435 17131337 20101243 16885385 22384356 21655089 25194673 23128226 17982118 21499250 19578367 18978787 15236168 7475662 25378557 18311140 22037553 17350979 22634755 11385474 17572673 23263490 23535722 22077970 18602922 18978790 21909110 19578363 20509871 23535730 20543847 20354512 23535732 17401363 23528559 19430480 25393678 19659756 17554300 20972440 14973285 24487276 22588877 23535734 24163127 18372905 20453842 1648480 23535729 9618505 9002677 4843792 11413533 22810696 24262325 22878375 21743467
26631737	Genome-wide Association Studies Identify Genetic Loci Associated With Albuminuria in Diabetes.	Elevated concentrations of albumin in the urine, albuminuria, are a hallmark of diabetic kidney disease and are associated with an increased risk for end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events. To gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying albuminuria, we conducted meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies and independent replication in up to 5,825 individuals of European ancestry with diabetes and up to 46,061 without diabetes, followed by functional studies. Known associations of variants in CUBN, encoding cubilin, with the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were confirmed in the overall sample (P = 2.4 × 10(-10)). Gene-by-diabetes interactions were detected and confirmed for variants in HS6ST1 and near RAB38/CTSC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms at these loci demonstrated a genetic effect on UACR in individuals with but not without diabetes. The change in the average UACR per minor allele was 21% for HS6ST1 (P = 6.3 × 10(-7)) and 13% for RAB38/CTSC (P = 5.8 × 10(-7)). Experiments using streptozotocin-induced diabetic Rab38 knockout and control rats showed higher urinary albumin concentrations and reduced amounts of megalin and cubilin at the proximal tubule cell surface in Rab38 knockout versus control rats. Relative expression of RAB38 was higher in tubuli of patients with diabetic kidney disease compared with control subjects. The loci identified here confirm known pathways and highlight novel pathways influencing albuminuria.	 25257325 25431330 10550421 10581027 10644753 11315092 12815097 12958120 15112169 7643540 9535912 15585850 15610229 15758045 15843158 18451988 19603039 19859073 20081858 20338960 20616382 20858683 21355061 21289598 21307840 21289597 21600934 21752957 21980298 22155946 22885922 23103723 23291471 23362314 23195032 23247405 24013639 24206460 24316577 24098934

26704534	Genome-wide association study of 25(OH) Vitamin D concentrations in Punjabi Sikhs: Results of the Asian Indian diabetic heart study.	Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in multiple disease conditions and accumulating evidence supports that the variation in serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, including deficiency, is under strong genetic control. However, the underlying genetic mechanism associated with vitamin 25(OH)D concentrations is poorly understood. We earlier reported a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity in a Punjabi Sikh diabetic cohort as part of the Asian Indian diabetic heart study (AIDHS). Here we have performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of serum 25(OH)D on 3538 individuals from this Punjabi Sikh population. Our discovery GWAS comprised of 1387 subjects followed by validation of 24 putative SNPs (P<10(-4)) using an independent replication sample (n=2151) from the same population by direct genotyping. A novel locus at chromosome 20p11.21 represented by rs2207173 with minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.29, [β=-0.13, p=4.47×10(-9)] between FOXA2 and SSTR4 was identified to be associated with 25(OH)D levels. Another suggestive association signal at rs11586313 (MAF 0.54) [β=0.90; p=1.36×10(-6)] was found within the regulatory region of the IVL gene on chromosome 1q21.3. Additionally, our study replicated 3 of 5 known GWAS genes associated with 25(OH)D concentrations including GC (p=0.007) and CYP2R1 (p=0.019) reported in Europeans and the DAB1 (p=0.003), reported in Hispanics. Identification of novel association signals in biologically plausible regions with 25(OH)D metabolism will provide new molecular insights on genetic drivers of vitamin D status and its implications in health disparities. 	 22071212 14555267 15314688 20003690 505004 15563441 21558052 18400738 24878043 19675199 21110115 20809279 2839537 23828045 20736230 17236760 20600896 15959514 16549493 22426800 14693921 20418485 21557308 19846176 12445200 9435436 24795349 14726171 3766454 18797817 20655470 18598350 6196178 24622671 11204437 19615888 23300278 20655471 24199029 20541252 14699589 22361322 20601302 19934400
26675016	A Genome-Wide Association Study Uncovers a Genetic Locus Associated with Thoracic-to-Hip Ratio in Koreans.	The thoracic-to-hip circumference ratio (THR) is an anthropometric marker recently described as a predictor of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by confirmatory analyses to identify genetic markers associated with THR. A total of 7,240 Korean subjects (4,988 for the discovery stage and 2,252 for the confirmatory analyses) were recruited for this study, and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the initial 4,988 individuals was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP array 5.0. Linear regression analysis was then performed to adjust for the effects of age, sex, and current diabetes medication status on the THR of the study subjects. In the initial discovery stage, there was a statistically nominal association between minor alleles of SNP markers on chromosomes 4, 8, 10, and 12, and THR changes (p < 5.0 × 10-6). The subsequent confirmatory analyses of these markers, however, only detected a significant association between two SNPs in the HECTD4 gene and decreased THRs. Notably, this association was detected in male (rs11066280: p = 1.14 × 10-2; rs2074356: p = 1.10 × 10-2), but not in female subjects. Meanwhile, the combined results from the two analyses (initial and confirmatory) indicated that minor alleles of these two intronic variants exhibited a significant genome-wide association with decreased THR in the male subjects (n = 3,155; rs11066280: effect size = -0.008624, p = 6.19 × 10-9; rs2074356: effect size = -0.008762, p = 1.89 × 10-8). Furthermore, minor alleles of these two SNPs exhibited protective effects on patients' risks for developing type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, we have identified two genetic variations in HECTD4 that are associated with THR, particularly in men. 	 24981077 22006218 12716671 16235980 9447951 3802833 11707536 21572416 22158537 25706874 11311100 2389754 15297300 9075814 21679732 20634204 24598265 18551112 28664047 11434789 19396169 11556298

26691988	A large genome-wide association study of age-related macular degeneration highlights contributions of rare and common variants.	Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, with limited therapeutic options. Here we report on a study of >12 million variants, including 163,714 directly genotyped, mostly rare, protein-altering variants. Analyzing 16,144 patients and 17,832 controls, we identify 52 independently associated common and rare variants (P < 5 × 10(-8)) distributed across 34 loci. Although wet and dry AMD subtypes exhibit predominantly shared genetics, we identify the first genetic association signal specific to wet AMD, near MMP9 (difference P value = 4.1 × 10(-10)). Very rare coding variants (frequency <0.1%) in CFH, CFI and TIMP3 suggest causal roles for these genes, as does a splice variant in SLC16A8. Our results support the hypothesis that rare coding variants can pinpoint causal genes within known genetic loci and illustrate that applying the approach systematically to detect new loci requires extremely large sample sizes. 	 17943122 18111349 18000842 18524945 19264985 19684571 19763151 20130649 20189972 20385819 20383146 24336208 24443550 24507775 24350677 20471002 20657596 20935630 20926424 21167468 21234875 21376301 21374718 21498613 21909106 21983784 22019782 22251874 22138821 22176800 22532805 22427542 22566555 22513993 22604720 22604722 22820512 22955616 22983955 22843982 23128226 23104008 23644456 23685748 23788246 24036949 24036950 24036952 24203711 24243840 24259432 24285300 24235017 24439028 24584071 24757147 24728293 25104651 24773320 25487149 25673412 25673413 10592173 10802651 11125122 23506875 23455636 23539594 11297486 11315092 11594943 14968411 6272276 7920634 9295268 15297300 15803201 16286620 17724228

26685716	Genome-wide association study reveals two loci for serum magnesium concentrations in European-American children.	Magnesium ions are essential to the basic metabolic processes in the human body. Previous genetic studies indicate that serum magnesium levels are highly heritable, and a few genetic loci have been reported involving regulation of serum magnesium in adults. In this study, we examined if additional loci influence serum magnesium levels in children. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,267 European-American children genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 or Quad610 arrays, sharing over 500,000 markers, as the discovery cohort and 257 European-American children genotyped on the Illumina Human OmniExpress arrays as the replication cohort. After genotype imputation, the strongest associations uncovered were with imputed SNPs residing within the FGFR2 (rs1219515, P = 1.1 × 10(-5)) and PAPSS2 (rs1969821, P = 7.2 × 10(-6)) loci in the discovery cohort, both of which were robustly replicated in our independent patient cohort (rs1219515, P = 3.5 × 10(-3); rs1969821, P = 1.2 × 10(-2)). The associations at the FGFR2 locus were also weakly replicated in a dataset from a previous GWAS of serum magnesium in European adults. Our results indicate that FGFR2 and PAPSS2 may play an important role in the regulation of magnesium homeostasis in children of European-American ancestry. 	 7719344 16862161 9771708 9385368 20700443 10788809 12193151 2184830 17572673 22791835 20616382 19828898 26322160 12716056 20634204 17701901 23269371 23263863 24402002 21167468 11004227 19968914 25886283 22518291 19543373
26686553	A genome-wide association study identifies four novel susceptibility loci underlying inguinal hernia.	Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed operations in the world, yet little is known about the genetic mechanisms that predispose individuals to develop inguinal hernias. We perform a genome-wide association analysis of surgically confirmed inguinal hernias in 72,805 subjects (5,295 cases and 67,510 controls) and confirm top associations in an independent cohort of 92,444 subjects with self-reported hernia repair surgeries (9,701 cases and 82,743 controls). We identify four novel inguinal hernia susceptibility loci in the regions of EFEMP1, WT1, EBF2 and ADAMTS6. Moreover, we observe expression of all four genes in mouse connective tissue and network analyses show an important role for two of these genes (EFEMP1 and WT1) in connective tissue maintenance/homoeostasis. Our findings provide insight into the aetiology of hernia development and highlight genetic pathways for studies of hernia development and its treatment. 	 17872905 21309044 24929828 18520236 21858135 23870221 23291589 24080855 15708288 22384356 20585627 21267615 10694077 20714348 370588 15123717 17853480 19095216 20236620 21839736 26092718 22138821 15293113 21820838 22509285 11822701 26092716 18546601 9225924 15373769 23423330 17263984 21675849 12165855 22820512 22271804 14654707 19951893 24875419 23535732 11872152 23388353 1566949 16912181 24309999 22306650 25338720 17924348 22955989 24295890 25270082 21571867 14533902 24814748 17701901 18391952 23925543 16820942 21236619 18203154 20981092 17374852 7914310 8921464 23727862 17324935 2154334

27897004	IDENTIFYING GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH VARIABILITY IN METABOLIC HEALTH AND BLOOD COUNT LABORATORY VALUES: DIVING INTO THE QUANTITATIVE TRAITS BY LEVERAGING LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM AN EHR.	A wide range of patient health data is recorded in Electronic Health Records (EHR). This data includes diagnosis, surgical procedures, clinical laboratory measurements, and medication information. Together this information reflects the patient's medical history. Many studies have efficiently used this data from the EHR to find associations that are clinically relevant, either by utilizing International Classification of Diseases, version 9 (ICD-9) codes or laboratory measurements, or by designing phenotype algorithms to extract case and control status with accuracy from the EHR. Here we developed a strategy to utilize longitudinal quantitative trait data from the EHR at Geisinger Health System focusing on outpatient metabolic and complete blood panel data as a starting point. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) as well as Complete Blood Counts (CBC) are parts of routine care and provide a comprehensive picture from high level screening of patients' overall health and disease. We randomly split our data into two datasets to allow for discovery and replication. We first conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with median values of 25 different clinical laboratory measurements to identify variants from Human Omni Express Exome beadchip data that are associated with these measurements. We identified 687 variants that associated and replicated with the tested clinical measurements at p<5×10-08. Since longitudinal data from the EHR provides a record of a patient's medical history, we utilized this information to further investigate the ICD-9 codes that might be associated with differences in variability of the measurements in the longitudinal dataset. We identified low and high variance patients by looking at changes within their individual longitudinal EHR laboratory results for each of the 25 clinical lab values (thus creating 50 groups - a high variance and a low variance for each lab variable). We then performed a PheWAS analysis with ICD-9 diagnosis codes, separately in the high variance group and the low variance group for each lab variable. We found 717 PheWAS associations that replicated at a p-value less than 0.001. Next, we evaluated the results of this study by comparing the association results between the high and low variance groups. For example, we found 39 SNPs (in multiple genes) associated with ICD-9 250.01 (Type-I diabetes) in patients with high variance of plasma glucose levels, but not in patients with low variance in plasma glucose levels. Another example is the association of 4 SNPs in UMOD with chronic kidney disease in patients with high variance for aspartate aminotransferase (discovery p-value: 8.71×10-09 and replication p-value: 2.03×10-06). In general, we see a pattern of many more statistically significant associations from patients with high variance in the quantitative lab variables, in comparison with the low variance group across all of the 25 laboratory measurements. This study is one of the first of its kind to utilize quantitative trait variance from longitudinal laboratory data to find associations among genetic variants and clinical phenotypes obtained from an EHR, integrating laboratory values and diagnosis codes to understand the genetic complexities of common diseases.	
26732429	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies multiple lung cancer susceptibility loci in never-smoking Asian women.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer in Asian never-smoking women have previously identified six susceptibility loci associated with lung cancer risk. To further discover new susceptibility loci, we imputed data from four GWAS of Asian non-smoking female lung cancer (6877 cases and 6277 controls) using the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1 Release 3) data as the reference and genotyped additional samples (5878 cases and 7046 controls) for possible replication. In our meta-analysis, three new loci achieved genome-wide significance, marked by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7741164 at 6p21.1 (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.17; P = 5.8 × 10(-13)), rs72658409 at 9p21.3 (per-allele OR = 0.77; P = 1.41 × 10(-10)) and rs11610143 at 12q13.13 (per-allele OR = 0.89; P = 4.96 × 10(-9)). These findings identified new genetic susceptibility alleles for lung cancer in never-smoking women in Asia and merit follow-up to understand their biological underpinnings.	 22138821 22064851 22797724 22955989 22899653 23103227 22886559 23263486 23535729 23770605 23996088 24403052 25239644 25338720 12072543 12209611 12802286 12970751 14704198 15184900 9760194 17060358 18788891 19478016 19571179 19578364 19578366 19578367 19836008 20453838 20512145 20676098 20871597 21058334 20846923 21152010 21558279 21642993 21725308 21983787 22586632

26733130	Sequence variants in the PTCH1 gene associate with spine bone mineral density and osteoporotic fractures.	Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measure of osteoporosis and is useful in evaluating the risk of fracture. In a genome-wide association study of BMD among 20,100 Icelanders, with follow-up in 10,091 subjects of European and East-Asian descent, we found a new BMD locus that harbours the PTCH1 gene, represented by rs28377268 (freq. 11.4-22.6%) that associates with reduced spine BMD (P=1.0 × 10(-11), β=-0.09). We also identified a new spine BMD signal in RSPO3, rs577721086 (freq. 6.8%), that associates with increased spine BMD (P=6.6 × 10(-10), β=0.14). Importantly, both variants associate with osteoporotic fractures and affect expression of the PTCH1 and RSPO3 genes that is in line with their influence on BMD and known biological function of these genes. Additional new BMD signals were also found at the AXIN1 and SOST loci and a new lead SNP at the EN1 locus. 	 17568781 17323110 18455228 18477451 18477452 23389618 22707064 23482648 23644456 24097068 24532711 24430505 25313900 25282103 25807286 26367794 26235824 18445777 19028354 9240735 13655060 15654335 15940371 16007331 17012270 19079262 19165921 19249006 19801982 20016592 19766747 20096396 20548944 20644199 20634204 20981099 21526222 21533022 22189423 22064851 22504420 22690667 22955616 11315092 17144789 17109061 18344981
26741287	Genome-wide association study of antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine antigens.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of antibody responses directed to three Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens (MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP) previously associated with different patterns of protection against malaria infection in Senegalese children. A total of 174 950 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) responses directed to MSP1 and to GLURP and with IgG3 responses to MSP2 FC27 and to MSP2 3D7. We first performed a single-trait analysis with each antibody response and then a multiple-trait analysis in which we analyzed simultaneously the three immune responses associated with the control of clinical malaria episodes. Suggestive associations (P<1 × 10(-4)) were observed for 25 SNPs in MSP1 antibody response analysis or in multiple-trait analysis. According to the strength of their observed associations and their functional role, the following genes are of particular interest: RASGRP3 (2p22.3, P=7.6 × 10(-6)), RIMS1 (6q13, P=2.0 × 10(-5)), MVB12B (9q33.3, P=8.9 × 10(-5)) and GNPTAB (12q23.2, P=7.4 × 10(-5)). Future studies will be required to replicate these findings in other African populations. This work will contribute to the elucidation of the host genetic factors underlying variable immune responses to P. falciparum. 	 21160409 23745572 20370319 22238582 25601403 19465909 22310894 22542470 16009966 20516000 22198390 22567092 17381244 22895189 23935200 22268665 20657648 16679042 19680538 20385827 22143225 20400458 9574796 12925516 24431533 19910682 1928564 21187399 25521226 11387043 24594077 11704810 10869334 16465621 19859562 17696947 24185611 9870865 24531419 20060278 11731797 26314886 21764829 9545414 16859949 17430550 16935861 9735937 22496357 22658931 10722143 10782012 21549219 9683598 21949811 25887595 18983245 17510307 13880318 16301621 15853923 22753485 22902788 17349871 22761960 20084087 18431485

26752265	Genome-wide association analysis identifies TXNRD2, ATXN2 and FOXC1 as susceptibility loci for primary open-angle glaucoma.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed meta-analysis on genome-wide association study (GWAS) results from eight independent studies from the United States (3,853 cases and 33,480 controls) and investigated the most significantly associated SNPs in two Australian studies (1,252 cases and 2,592 controls), three European studies (875 cases and 4,107 controls) and a Singaporean Chinese study (1,037 cases and 2,543 controls). A meta-analysis of the top SNPs identified three new associated loci: rs35934224[T] in TXNRD2 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, P = 4.05 × 10(-11)) encoding a mitochondrial protein required for redox homeostasis; rs7137828[T] in ATXN2 (OR = 1.17, P = 8.73 × 10(-10)); and rs2745572[A] upstream of FOXC1 (OR = 1.17, P = 1.76 × 10(-10)). Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we show TXNRD2 and ATXN2 expression in retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve head. These results identify new pathways underlying POAG susceptibility and suggest new targets for preventative therapies. 	 20616382 20702402 20835238 21060863 20970107 20881294 21526222 21528004 21532571 21779181 22103894 22064851 22222511 22570617 22570627 22820512 22955989 22941192 23069478 23756893 24003086 24316576 24002674 24556684 24670762 24656865 24825645 24875647 24894543 25098532 25173105 25173106 25173107 24974815 25352121 25436857 25338720 25700176 25803835 25954001 20395239 11158794 11755836 12045153 12499305 16488940 16862161 17113580 19543373 19933162 20126492 20233392 20399928 20689021
26752167	A Genome-wide study of blood pressure in African Americans accounting for gene-smoking interaction.	Cigarette smoking has been shown to be a health hazard. In addition to being considered a negative lifestyle behavior, studies have shown that cigarette smoking has been linked to genetic underpinnings of hypertension. Because African Americans have the highest incidence and prevalence of hypertension, we examined the joint effect of genetics and cigarette smoking on health among this understudied population. The sample included African Americans from the genome wide association studies of HyperGEN (N = 1083, discovery sample) and GENOA (N = 1427, replication sample), both part of the FBPP. Results suggested that 2 SNPs located on chromosomes 14 (NEDD8; rs11158609; raw p = 9.80 × 10(-9), genomic control-adjusted p = 2.09 × 10(-7)) and 17 (TTYH2; rs8078051; raw p = 6.28 × 10(-8), genomic control-adjusted p = 9.65 × 10(-7)) were associated with SBP including the genetic interaction with cigarette smoking. These two SNPs were not associated with SBP in a main genetic effect only model. This study advances knowledge in the area of main and joint effects of genetics and cigarette smoking on hypertension among African Americans and offers a model to the reader for assessing these risks. More research is required to determine how these genes play a role in expression of hypertension.	 20591971 19430479 19430483 20847044 21052022 21316600 21338875 21347282 21386085 10964005 10982861 11315092 11525833 11597145 11799070 12379876 12522688 12574083 12759363 14690597 15010458 15242646 15939539 16053990 16152135 16219661 16923450 17283440 17660949 17981502 18260827 18759277 19008710 18974171 19247474 19581569 19635985 20003179 19896728 20402968 20418890 20603103 21253885 20212493 21445957 21378095 22001757 22302110 22581228 22836579 22760307 21859746 23368731 23353631 23972371 23812770 24446284 25520374

A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs185386680, showed the strongest association with ATD-induced agranulocytosis in GWAS (odds ratio (OR) = 36.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.8-103.7; P = 1.3 × 10(-24)) and replication (OR = 37; 95% CI = 3.7-367.4; P = 9.6 × 10(-7)). HLA-B*38:02:01 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs185386680. High-resolution HLA typing confirmed that HLA-B*38:02:01 was associated with carbimazole (CMZ)/methimazole (MMI)-induced agranulocytosis (OR = 265.5; 95% CI = 27.9-2528.0; P = 2.5 × 10(-14)), but not associated with propylthiouracil (PTU). The positive and negative predictive values of HLA-B*38:02:01 in predicting CMZ/MMI-induced agranulocytosis were 0.07 and 0.999. Approximately 211 cases need to be screened to prevent one case. Screening for the risk allele will be useful in preventing agranulocytosis in populations in which the frequency of the risk allele is high.	
26754954	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of anxiety disorders.	Anxiety disorders (ADs), namely generalized AD, panic disorder and phobias, are common, etiologically complex conditions with a partially genetic basis. Despite differing on diagnostic definitions based on clinical presentation, ADs likely represent various expressions of an underlying common diathesis of abnormal regulation of basic threat-response systems. We conducted genome-wide association analyses in nine samples of European ancestry from seven large, independent studies. To identify genetic variants contributing to genetic susceptibility shared across interview-generated DSM-based ADs, we applied two phenotypic approaches: (1) comparisons between categorical AD cases and supernormal controls, and (2) quantitative phenotypic factor scores (FS) derived from a multivariate analysis combining information across the clinical phenotypes. We used logistic and linear regression, respectively, to analyze the association between these phenotypes and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Meta-analysis for each phenotype combined results across the nine samples for over 18 000 unrelated individuals. Each meta-analysis identified a different genome-wide significant region, with the following markers showing the strongest association: for case-control contrasts, rs1709393 located in an uncharacterized non-coding RNA locus on chromosomal band 3q12.3 (P=1.65 × 10(-8)); for FS, rs1067327 within CAMKMT encoding the calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase on chromosomal band 2p21 (P=2.86 × 10(-9)). Independent replication and further exploration of these findings are needed to more fully understand the role of these variants in risk and expression of ADs.	 18763692 21733222 22889921 15699295 17254420 25642630 20368705 24821223 19885930 20516154 22820512 25132410 19859063 21217833 22614290 23564355 20048750 22869035 11578982 25544106 12883005 12963675 20616382 14550627 12537867 20567237 23453885 19957279 25390645 24246330 17974937 23149450 6544237 15918338 21058334 24278274 23726511 18781961 17955331 20595427 16718280 21167468 20975703 22243964 21397060 16913837 19292899 24080187 25431468 19918758
26763881	Genome-wide association study of serum lipids confirms previously reported associations as well as new associations of common SNPs within PCSK7 gene with triglyceride.	Previous reports including genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have described associations of serum lipids with genomic variations. In the present study, we examined the association of ∼2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 3041 Japanese healthy volunteers obtained from the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database with serum lipids. We confirmed the previously reported associations of 14 SNPs in 5 regions for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 23 SNPs in 12 regions for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 16 SNPs in 6 regions for triglyceride and 5 SNPs in 1 region for phospholipid. Furthermore, we identified 16 possible novel candidate genes associated with LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides, where SNPs had P-values of <1 × 10(-5). Further replication analyses of these genes with Korean data revealed significant associations of SNPs located within the PCSK7 gene and triglyceride (Pmeta=7.98 × 10(-9) and 1.91 × 10(-8) for rs508487 and rs236911, respectively). These associations remained significant even by the conditional analysis adjusting for three neighboring variations associated with triglyceride. Our present data suggest that PCSK7 as well as PCSK9 may be associated with lipids, especially triglyceride, and may serve as a candidate for a new drug target to treat lipid abnormality syndromes. 	 18193044 8622945 24097068 25005712 22418572 25855068 16862161 18193043 12730697 4366052 21912425 17012247 25707395 24507774 21084752 21149283 14727156 22286219 20686565 19936222 7962532 14727179 18262040 25055868 21829377 25096692 19060911 22623978 24236482 16934002 17701901 19060906 21909109 19798445 19802338 24101515
26767831	A genome-wide association study of pulmonary tuberculosis in Morocco.	Although epidemiological evidence suggests a human genetic basis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) susceptibility, the identification of specific genes and alleles influencing PTB risk has proven to be difficult. Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified only three novel loci with modest effect sizes in sub-Saharan African and Russian populations. We performed a GWA study of 550,352 autosomal SNPs in a family-based discovery Moroccan sample (on the full population and on the subset with PTB diagnosis at <25 years), which identified 143 SNPs with p < 1 × 10(-4). The replication study in an independent case/control sample identified four SNPs displaying a p < 0.01 implicating the same risk allele. In the combined sample including 556 PTB subjects and 650 controls these four SNPs showed suggestive association (2 × 10(-6) < p < 4 × 10(-5)): rs358793 and rs17590261 were intergenic, while rs6786408 and rs916943 were located in introns of FOXP1 and AGMO, respectively. Both genes are involved in the function of macrophages, which are the site of latency and reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most significant finding (p = 2 × 10(-6)) was obtained for the AGMO SNP in an early (<25 years) age-at-onset subset, confirming the importance of considering age-at-onset to decipher the genetic basis of PTB. Although only suggestive, these findings highlight several avenues for future research in the human genetics of PTB.	 16103355 20725040 16801399 22825450 23743196 25044438 23415668 25774636 11313775 19938975 9486992 25143445 18799727 11349068 24610875 8032047 8490962 25083600 22233810 24821915 25703555 22239941 22018224 20950788 19901083 16365144 22291100 21533230 23456169 20206579 11861613 23516984 22790178 20509871 17701901 25307123 24057671 22306650 24717627 22551897 20694014

26763874	Genome-wide association study reveals sex-specific selection signals against autosomal nucleotide variants.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to examine genetic associations of common autosomal nucleotide variants with sex in a Korean population with 4183 males and 4659 females. Nine genetic association signals were identified in four intragenic and five intergenic regions (P<5 × 10(-8)). Further analysis with an independent data set confirmed two intragenic association signals in the genes encoding protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 12B (PPP1R12B, intron 12, rs1819043) and dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 11 (DNAH11, intron 61, rs10255013), which are directly involved in the reproductive system. This study revealed autosomal genetic variants associated with sex ratio by GWAS for the first time. This implies that genetic variants in proximity to the association signals may influence sex-specific selection and contribute to sex ratio variation. Further studies are required to reveal the mechanisms underlying sex-specific selection. 	 9674985 11978342 17589781 22843499 15105404 21892150 6614009 16203237 23480133 6056273 19435018 15075390 15297300 9006564 14688172 16267090 21127458 3071849 20129397 19606528 21167468 3319883 19396169 25640449 22184204 25701395

Studies of Caucasian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to identify genetic biomarkers of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response have used response at a single time point as the phenotype with which single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations have been tested. The findings have been inconsistent across studies. Among Japanese patients, only a few SNPs have been investigated.

26780889	Meta-analysis of lipid-traits in Hispanics identifies novel loci, population-specific effects, and tissue-specific enrichment of eQTLs.	We performed genome-wide meta-analysis of lipid traits on three samples of Mexican and Mexican American ancestry comprising 4,383 individuals, and followed up significant and highly suggestive associations in three additional Hispanic samples comprising 7,876 individuals. Genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near CELSR2, ZNF259/APOA5, KANK2/DOCK6 and NCAN/MAU2 for total cholesterol, LPL, ABCA1, ZNF259/APOA5, LIPC and CETP for HDL cholesterol, CELSR2, APOB and NCAN/MAU2 for LDL cholesterol, and GCKR, TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5 and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides. Linkage disequilibrium and conditional analyses indicate that signals observed at ABCA1 and LIPC for HDL cholesterol and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides are independent of previously reported lead SNP associations. Analyses of lead SNPs from the European Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) dataset in our Hispanic samples show remarkable concordance of direction of effects as well as strong correlation in effect sizes. A meta-analysis of the European GLGC and our Hispanic datasets identified five novel regions reaching genome-wide significance: two for total cholesterol (FN1 and SAMM50), two for HDL cholesterol (LOC100996634 and COPB1) and one for LDL cholesterol (LINC00324/CTC1/PFAS). The top meta-analysis signals were found to be enriched for SNPs associated with gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion, suggesting an enrichment of tissue-specific function in lipid-associated loci. 	 4337382 15941488 23726366 24097068 17194218 22719876 22319020 23063622 23505323 20585729 20501604 22138821 24352519 24068893 17572673 20686565 22820512 21901158 23755062 25307299 12397006 12883005 17845730 21637794 20517342 20686566 21573907 24509480 22958899 21738485 24897026 21647700 20634204 18776909 21397060 24886709 22958900 19933162 17903299
26785701	Genome-wide association studies in East Asians identify new loci for waist-hip ratio and waist circumference.	Sixty genetic loci associated with abdominal obesity, measured by waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR), have been previously identified, primarily from studies conducted in European-ancestry populations. We conducted a meta-analysis of associations of abdominal obesity with approximately 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 53,052 (for WC) and 48,312 (for WHR) individuals of Asian descent, and replicated 33 selected SNPs among 3,762 to 17,110 additional individuals. We identified four novel loci near the EFEMP1, ADAMTSL3 , CNPY2, and GNAS genes that were associated with WC after adjustment for body mass index (BMI); two loci near the NID2 and HLA-DRB5 genes associated with WHR after adjustment for BMI, and three loci near the CEP120, TSC22D2, and SLC22A2 genes associated with WC without adjustment for BMI. Functional enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, GNRH signaling, and/or CDK5 signaling pathways for those newly-identified loci. Our study provides additional insight on genetic contribution to abdominal obesity. 	 21909109 21757498 22344219 22479202 22955989 23563607 23754948 23966867 24861553 25640676 25673412 11315092 12164465 7799918 17110092 17875489 17903300 17872905 18454146 19396169 19557161 20220758 19557197 25673413 20881960 20935629 20935630 21270382 21386085 20966902 21572416 21971053
26831199	Genetic associations at 53 loci highlight cell types and biological pathways relevant for kidney function.	Reduced glomerular filtration rate defines chronic kidney disease and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), combining data across 133,413 individuals with replication in up to 42,166 individuals. We identify 24 new and confirm 29 previously identified loci. Of these 53 loci, 19 associate with eGFR among individuals with diabetes. Using bioinformatics, we show that identified genes at eGFR loci are enriched for expression in kidney tissues and in pathways relevant for kidney development and transmembrane transporter activity, kidney structure, and regulation of glucose metabolism. Chromatin state mapping and DNase I hypersensitivity analyses across adult tissues demonstrate preferential mapping of associated variants to regulatory regions in kidney but not extra-renal tissues. These findings suggest that genetic determinants of eGFR are mediated largely through direct effects within the kidney and highlight important cell types and biological pathways. 	 21909115 11315092 11979335 23013600 20445134 20068286 22125221 14597658 21931561 22962313 24316577 24185693 14970063 22155946 18295055 23013602 22955616 20383145 11782049 20616382 16415888 21378990 18798982 19584346 24206460 19557189 23406875 20383146 24073334 16316385 20222955 2252919 24098934 23263488 19430482 17701901 22479191 22797727 23727165 21980298 22955828 25597830 14685227 23724904 20081858

26908625	Genome-wide association and Mendelian randomization study of NT-proBNP in patients with acute coronary syndrome.	N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a strong predictor of mortality in coronary artery disease and is widely employed as a prognostic biomarker. However, a causal relationship between NT-proBNP and clinical endpoints has not been established. We have performed a genome-wide association and Mendelian randomization study of NT-proBNP. We used a discovery set of 3740 patients from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, which enrolled 18 624 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A further set of 5492 patients, from the same trial, was used for replication. Genetic variants at two novel loci (SLC39A8 and POC1B/GALNT4) were associated with NT-proBNP levels and replicated together with the previously known NPPB locus. The most significant SNP (rs198389, pooled P = 1.07 × 10(-15)) in NPPB interrupts an E-box consensus motif in the gene promoter. The association in SLC39A8 is driven by a deleterious variant (rs13107325, pooled P = 5.99 × 10(-10)), whereas the most significant SNP in POC1B/GALNT4 (rs11105306, pooled P = 1.02 × 10(-16)) is intronic. The SLC39A8 SNP was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) death (HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08-1.79, P = 0.0095), but the other loci were not associated with clinical endpoints. We have identified two novel loci to be associated with NT-proBNP in patients with ACS. Only the SLC39A8 variant, but not the NPPB variant, was associated with a clinical endpoint. Due to pleotropic effects of SLC39A8, these results do not suggest that NT-proBNP levels have a direct effect on mortality in ACS patients.

However, no genetic markers of treatment response have been reproducibly identified.	 11333064 23840348 17696023 19448189 24806176 11531653 22566560 24369049 21961650 23071447 22820512 21926972 20616382 16176433 10665622 17442400 24534415 24806175 21047205 19875103 25338720 14702242 569523 20888048 20453537 17485606 17701901 23269371 25553497 12416605 23663953
27179730	Genetic loci associated with ideal cardiovascular health: A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.	Multiple genetic loci are associated with clinical cardiovascular (CV) disease and individual CV risk factors. Individuals with ideal levels of all major CV risk factors have very low risk for CV disease morbidity or mortality. Ideal levels of risk factors can be attained by lifestyle modifications; however, little is known about gene variants associated with ideal CV health. Our objective was to carry out a genome-wide association study on the trait.	 23874508 23202125 25023634 10591383 12324284 12351457 12397006 14609782 15210882 1208363 3204420 2646917 16287773 15883242 9770560 16344375 16461820 17293199 17658951 18974171 19161620 19752328 20031568 20081858 20089546 20686565 20616382 20498921 20838585 21123754 21386085 21492767 21740922 21909108 21909115 22144573 22286219 22399527 22832961 22941192 23117780 24097068

26815016	Identification of IRX1 as a Risk Locus for Rheumatoid Factor Positivity in Rheumatoid Arthritis in a Genome-Wide Association Study.	Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a well-established diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, ∼20% of RA patients are negative for this anti-IgG antibody. To date, only variation at the HLA-DRB1 gene has been associated with the presence of RF. This study was undertaken to identify additional genetic variants associated with RF positivity.	
26821981	Genome-wide association analysis to predict optimal antipsychotic dosage in schizophrenia: a pilot study.	In recent years, several studies have investigated genetic polymorphisms of antipsychotic drug-metabolizing enzymes and receptors. However, most studies focused on drug response and very few have investigated the genetic influence on antipsychotic dosage. The aim of the present study is to test the association between antipsychotic dosages at genome-wide level. The current dosage of antipsychotic medications was collected from 79 schizophrenia patients. The dosage was standardized using three different methods: chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZe), defined daily dose (DDD), and percentage of maximum dose (PM %). The patients were then genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 BeadChip Kit. All markers were screened for significance using linear regression, and the p values were visualized using a Manhattan plot. The genome-wide analysis showed that the top Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with dosage variation were rs981975 on chromosome 14 for CPZe, rs4470690 on chromosome 4 for PM %, and rs79323383 on chromosome 8 for DDD. However, no genome-wide significantly associated SNPs were identified. In this pilot sample, we found promising trends for pharmacodynamic targets associated with antipsychotic dosage. Therefore, studies combining large prescription databases may identify genetic predictors to adjust the dose of antipsychotic medication. 	 21254948 3046553 24881126 9502547 17551351 21476873 21107309 20634204 17701901 19700006 20360319 19721433 24751813
26818947	Genome-wide association studies in the Japanese population identify seven novel loci for type 2 diabetes.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 80 susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but most of its heritability still remains to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for T2D in the Japanese population. Combined data from discovery and subsequent validation analyses (23,399 T2D cases and 31,722 controls) identify 7 new loci with genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), rs1116357 near CCDC85A, rs147538848 in FAM60A, rs1575972 near DMRTA1, rs9309245 near ASB3, rs67156297 near ATP8B2, rs7107784 near MIR4686 and rs67839313 near INAFM2. Of these, the association of 4 loci with T2D is replicated in multi-ethnic populations other than Japanese (up to 65,936 T2Ds and 158,030 controls, P<0.007). These results indicate that expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility loci to complex traits not only for ethnicity-specific loci but also for common loci across different ethnicities. 	 9722981 16381955 17463246 17463248 24509480 23615486 25043022 25082160 14663300 11063279 12221286 17463249 17632545 18462017 18464933 18694957 18817904 18711367 18711366 19366350 12490297 15052270 1310538 8843732 9686693 19470990 19254779 19557189 19531736 20081858 20581827 20616382 20634204 20818381 12901952 20981092 20821187 21058334 20858683 21142536 21249183 21874001 21778616 21947380 22180088 21948793 22075990 22158537 22446960 22581228 22456796 22820512 22885922 22885924 22865885 22941192 23160641 23300278 23840313 23679989 23775312 23945395 24390345 24390342 24464100
26829030	Identification of Susceptibility Loci for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	We report a genome-wide association study of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma conducted among non-Hispanic white members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system. The study includes a genome-wide screen of 61,457 members (6,891 cases and 54,566 controls) genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiom European array and a replication phase involving an independent set of 6,410 additional members (810 cases and 5,600 controls). Combined analysis of screening and replication phases identified 10 loci containing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P-values < 5 × 10(-8). Six loci contain genes in the pigmentation pathway; SNPs at these loci appear to modulate squamous cell carcinoma risk independently of the pigmentation phenotypes. Another locus contains HLA class II genes studied in relation to elevated squamous cell carcinoma risk following immunosuppression. SNPs at the remaining three loci include an intronic SNP in FOXP1 at locus 3p13, an intergenic SNP at 3q28 near TP63, and an intergenic SNP at 9p22 near BNC2. These findings provide insights into the genetic factors accounting for inherited squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility.	 23737760 21270109 20602913 18252222 7868372 11315092 22904134 11179997 22234890 23548203 18067632 20585627 16891417 21221757 17952075 22464347 25963972 18488026 18563784 10631149 18849993 25319428 19340012 21926416 21700618 26092718 25274579 21521370 26092716 19208107 21922536 23393597 16505357 1875968 20078223 18483556 20546537 21983787 19578363 25705849 19710684 11254446 20517342 21106904 24179397 7581459 18172690 17999355 23052946 12778064 22628150 25631878 19578364 24267888 16847698 11511307 18683857 21927029 18488027 15081112 24916375 19384953 18348202 21637289 12637924 21565264 21906913 23504663 17460731 20601102 19995372 21903159 25285922 22711192 19242514 25954001 24926819
26824906	No Evidence of a Common DNA Variant Profile Specific to World Class Endurance Athletes.	There are strong genetic components to cardiorespiratory fitness and its response to exercise training. It would be useful to understand the differences in the genomic profile of highly trained endurance athletes of world class caliber and sedentary controls. An international consortium (GAMES) was established in order to compare elite endurance athletes and ethnicity-matched controls in a case-control study design. Genome-wide association studies were undertaken on two cohorts of elite endurance athletes and controls (GENATHLETE and Japanese endurance runners), from which a panel of 45 promising markers was identified. These markers were tested for replication in seven additional cohorts of endurance athletes and controls: from Australia, Ethiopia, Japan, Kenya, Poland, Russia and Spain. The study is based on a total of 1520 endurance athletes (835 who took part in endurance events in World Championships and/or Olympic Games) and 2760 controls. We hypothesized that world-class athletes are likely to be characterized by an even higher concentration of endurance performance alleles and we performed separate analyses on this subsample. The meta-analysis of all available studies revealed one statistically significant marker (rs558129 at GALNTL6 locus, p = 0.0002), even after correcting for multiple testing. As shown by the low heterogeneity index (I2 = 0), all eight cohorts showed the same direction of association with rs558129, even though p-values varied across the individual studies. In summary, this study did not identify a panel of genomic variants common to these elite endurance athlete groups. Since GAMES was underpowered to identify alleles with small effect sizes, some of the suggestive leads identified should be explored in expanded comparisons of world-class endurance athletes and sedentary controls and in tightly controlled exercise training studies. Such studies have the potential to illuminate the biology not only of world class endurance performance but also of compromised cardiac functions and cardiometabolic diseases. 	 23632745 22876189 22288660 23287839 10797114 11039642 11299267 12879365 14523311 7166301 6542620 3698155 3784881 9346161 9502354 10411243 10484570 13704140 15789306 16358397 17701901 17903304 17998016 17921336 18179392 18067521 19123262 18984674 19666693 19384345 20133430 18718976 20634204 20977886 20798657 21183627 20459474 21696594 20551160 22174390 22170014 23990238
26822151	Genome-wide association study and targeted metabolomics identifies sex-specific association of CPS1 with coronary artery disease.	Metabolites derived from dietary choline and L-carnitine, such as trimethylamine N-oxide and betaine, have recently been identified as novel risk factors for atherosclerosis in mice and humans. We sought to identify genetic factors associated with plasma betaine levels and determine their effect on risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified two significantly associated loci on chromosomes 2q34 and 5q14.1. The lead variant on 2q24 (rs715) localizes to carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1), which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the first committed reaction and rate-limiting step in the urea cycle. Rs715 is also significantly associated with decreased levels of urea cycle metabolites and increased plasma glycine levels. Notably, rs715 yield a strikingly significant and protective association with decreased risk of CAD in only women. These results suggest that glycine metabolism and/or the urea cycle represent potentially novel sex-specific mechanisms for the development of atherosclerosis. 	 25378658 24097068 22075249 24704102 18941301 24675659 26343387 25569235 16197300 2742825 23614584 22503289 23620142 5471650 22982463 2318203 23615880 19477356 18462017 17086380 24004504 15922018 20154341 24296534 21293878 14718356 21378990 21637794 25600868 20383146 24651765 21886157 20031577 24816252 23823483 22236003 21475195 20037589 23312283 22006096 21852955 17701901 23824729 21602305 20031578 23563705 24047826 23770128 20346934 18349088 24625756 24497336 23378610 23969696
26833098	Genome-wide meta-analysis uncovers novel loci influencing circulating leptin levels.	Leptin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone, the circulating levels of which correlate closely with overall adiposity. Although rare mutations in the leptin (LEP) gene are well known to cause leptin deficiency and severe obesity, no common loci regulating circulating leptin levels have been uncovered. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating leptin levels from 32,161 individuals and followed up loci reaching P<10(-6) in 19,979 additional individuals. We identify five loci robustly associated (P<5 × 10(-8)) with leptin levels in/near LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL1 and FTO. Although the association of the FTO obesity locus with leptin levels is abolished by adjustment for BMI, associations of the four other loci are independent of adiposity. The GCKR locus was found associated with multiple metabolic traits in previous GWAS and the CCNL1 locus with birth weight. Knockdown experiments in mouse adipose tissue explants show convincing evidence for adipogenin, a regulator of adipocyte differentiation, as the novel causal gene in the SLC32A1 locus influencing leptin levels. Our findings provide novel insights into the regulation of leptin production by adipose tissue and open new avenues for examining the influence of variation in leptin levels on adiposity and metabolic health. 	 23751306 24097068 24140113 24247219 24062248 25597830 17229951 17122089 25673412 25673413 25693563 25642630 26422229 26427354 19473179 20081857 10546697 10671751 10744755 10792559 11110887 11118025 11281277 11689931 11846609 12006634 12385894 12393845 14512015 14749734 15059968 8532024 8621027 8717038 9018247 9202122 9491866 9500540 9537324 9539186 9543149 9604868 9200375 9824809 10100090 10486419 15567149 16132694 16246733 17093294 17825558 19079261 19151714 19252258 19041299 19557189 20167575 20421936 21037323 21135875 20733583 22038520 21660081 22326952 22485140 22581228 22885922 23202124 23563607 23563609

26833246	New loci for body fat percentage reveal link between adiposity and cardiometabolic disease risk.	To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of adiposity and its links to cardiometabolic disease risk, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of body fat percentage (BF%) in up to 100,716 individuals. Twelve loci reached genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), of which eight were previously associated with increased overall adiposity (BMI, BF%) and four (in or near COBLL1/GRB14, IGF2BP1, PLA2G6, CRTC1) were novel associations with BF%. Seven loci showed a larger effect on BF% than on BMI, suggestive of a primary association with adiposity, while five loci showed larger effects on BMI than on BF%, suggesting association with both fat and lean mass. In particular, the loci more strongly associated with BF% showed distinct cross-phenotype association signatures with a range of cardiometabolic traits revealing new insights in the link between adiposity and disease risk. 	 23202124 22869155 23563607 23563609 23630454 23482648 19079261 19151714 19557161 19557197 19578365 19734900 20074523 20195514 20346437 20421936 20686565 20410440 20935629 20935630 21300955 21478494 21418511 21706003 21829388 21998597 21983787 22001757 21719444 22301924 23643381 23568441 23583978 23449627 24097068 23207651 24439368 24762786 24686848 25231870 25282103 25597830 25673412 25673413 25642630 26343387 11264213 12421703 14749734 15121863 15059968 8289804 16098827 17434869 17999358 17982457 17658951 18454146 18454148 18758446 19079260 22344219 22344221 22383892 22479202 22589738 22484627 22885922 22885924 23001569
26830138	Family-based association analyses of imputed genotypes reveal genome-wide significant association of Alzheimer's disease with OSBPL6, PTPRG, and PDCL3.	The genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and heterogeneous. Over 200 highly penetrant pathogenic variants in the genes APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 cause a subset of early-onset familial AD. On the other hand, susceptibility to late-onset forms of AD (LOAD) is indisputably associated to the ɛ4 allele in the gene APOE, and more recently to variants in more than two-dozen additional genes identified in the large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses reports. Taken together however, although the heritability in AD is estimated to be as high as 80%, a large proportion of the underlying genetic factors still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a systematic family-based genome-wide association and meta-analysis on close to 15 million imputed variants from three large collections of AD families (~3500 subjects from 1070 families). Using a multivariate phenotype combining affection status and onset age, meta-analysis of the association results revealed three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that achieved genome-wide significance for association with AD risk: rs7609954 in the gene PTPRG (P-value=3.98 × 10	 19234470 14740322 15371430 21734406 19001172 18976728 16461860 9008509 22951892 8131123 17183645 12925516 20616382 19808789 23830809 23792958 8282104 18358323 24162737 6236805 23263488 23273601 16895437 17701901 20506136 18768484 15937480 21629274 11055368 19956679 22584455 19543373
26835600	GWAS of 89,283 individuals identifies genetic variants associated with self-reporting of being a morning person.	Circadian rhythms are a nearly universal feature of living organisms and affect almost every biological process. Our innate preference for mornings or evenings is determined by the phase of our circadian rhythms. We conduct a genome-wide association analysis of self-reported morningness, followed by analyses of biological pathways and related phenotypes. We identify 15 significantly associated loci, including seven near established circadian genes (rs12736689 near RGS16, P=7.0 × 10(-18); rs9479402 near VIP, P=3.9 × 10(-11); rs55694368 near PER2, P=2.6 × 10(-9); rs35833281 near HCRTR2, P=3.7 × 10(-9); rs11545787 near RASD1, P=1.4 × 10(-8); rs11121022 near PER3, P=2.0 × 10(-8); rs9565309 near FBXL3, P=3.5 × 10(-8). Circadian and phototransduction pathways are enriched in our results. Morningness is associated with insomnia and other sleep phenotypes; and is associated with body mass index and depression but we did not find evidence for a causal relationship in our Mendelian randomization analysis. Our findings reinforce current understanding of circadian biology and will guide future studies. 	 16199517 18680211 1027738 15187983 20585627 12841365 15700718 20714348 2765864 20813862 22064851 22578422 15477554 21779176 18988626 11232563 22509285 24329967 8673138 17561599 26176920 8097023 22820512 9325388 10646169 18797707 17462724 23001124 23483886 18510650 20935630 19198609 18032652 20950623 18079175 10458611 11463135 20075295 18784791 17346965 21610730 23001122 11086993 15052270 21285061 9493522 25201053 17924348 17463252 19779148 12110170 16167529 20981092 21167468 15339652 21056629 25673413 20148688 25469926 1673032
27333618	Genetic risk variants for membranous nephropathy: extension of and association with other chronic kidney disease aetiologies.	Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 300 000 genotyped variants identified MN-associated loci at HLA-DQA1 and PLA2R1.	 1980918 2576474 23364522 16862161 21997394 22138821 23431073 6439290 21612488 24262501 19571279 17572673 17997607 21323541 26343387 18179884 24715030 20517342 25349203 21968148 18252895 24892704 21399633 17701901 8501164 25271006 19543373 21862458 26132169 23813219 25394321 21612489
26861389	A Common Variant in the SETD7 Gene Predicts Serum Lycopene Concentrations.	Dietary intake and higher serum concentrations of lycopene have been associated with lower incidence of prostate cancer and other chronic diseases. Identifying determinants of serum lycopene concentrations may thus have important public health implications. Prior studies have suggested that serum lycopene concentrations are under partial genetic control. The goal of this research was to identify genetic predictors of serum lycopene concentrations using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach among a sample of 441 Old Order Amish adults that consumed a controlled diet. Linear regression models were utilized to evaluate associations between genetic variants and serum concentrations of lycopene. Variant rs7680948 on chromosome 4, located in the intron region of the SETD7 gene, was significantly associated with serum lycopene concentrations (p = 3.41 × 10(-9)). Our findings also provided nominal support for the association previously noted between SCARB1 and serum lycopene concentrations, although with a different SNP (rs11057841) in the region. This study identified a novel locus associated with serum lycopene concentrations and our results raise a number of intriguing possibilities regarding the nature of the relationship between SETD7 and lycopene, both of which have been independently associated with prostate cancer. Further investigation into this relationship might help provide greater mechanistic understanding of these associations. 	 12549764 22051423 16380590 21335507 8895059 21800039 18156403 24489447 23631493 20959290 19706858 24463248 12424325 21543537 21059979 21194693 15277161 17507623 20683458 20634673 23857058 26561629 12374981 18029479 24200674 16563224 23053559 22690215 19185284 20491642 22071840 25644336 17349800 18776909 16046733 8131277 18440328 17570925 18662427 18759275 23970935 22819555 22003152 24744306 21163596 22810988 19074352
26853712	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for craniofacial microsomia.	Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is a rare congenital anomaly that involves immature derivatives from the first and second pharyngeal arches. The genetic pathogenesis of CFM is still unclear. Here we interrogate 0.9 million genetic variants in 939 CFM cases and 2,012 controls from China. After genotyping of an additional 443 cases and 1,669 controls, we identify 8 significantly associated loci with the most significant SNP rs13089920 (logistic regression P=2.15 × 10(-120)) and 5 suggestive loci. The above 13 associated loci, harboured by candidates of ROBO1, GATA3, GBX2, FGF3, NRP2, EDNRB, SHROOM3, SEMA7A, PLCD3, KLF12 and EPAS1, are found to be enriched for genes involved in neural crest cell (NCC) development and vasculogenesis. We then perform whole-genome sequencing on 21 samples from the case cohort, and identify several novel loss-of-function mutations within the associated loci. Our results provide new insights into genetic background of craniofacial microsomia. 	 16530748 19293168 19944404 16172976 15192019 19384856 17194218 23144817 10869041 19004859 18435799 22689303 12202775 11846609 22064851 15996652 12768695 21959131 18199583 24983964 22517427 22823337 20949601 22106030 20080505 19112455 20616382 16415888 20354512 23633936 19557189 12223404 23180593 21478889 18383510 18356247 25108383 7550312 16951138 20634204 17891721 21737059 17701901 19561590 11406607 23269371 21167468 19131956 16804892 20702402 21200224 25597830 19543373 20815034 25171888
26908601	Genome-wide association analysis of self-reported events in 6135 individuals and 252 827 controls identifies 8 loci associated with thrombosis.	Thrombotic diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. To add insights into the genetic regulation of thrombotic disease, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 6135 self-reported blood clots events and 252 827 controls of European ancestry belonging to the 23andMe cohort of research participants. Eight loci exceeded genome-wide significance. Among the genome-wide significant results, our study replicated previously known venous thromboembolism (VTE) loci near the F5, FGA-FGG, F11, F2, PROCR and ABO genes, and the more recently discovered locus near SLC44A2 In addition, our study reports for the first time a genome-wide significant association between rs114209171, located upstream of the F8 structural gene, and thrombosis risk. Analyses of expression profiles and expression quantitative trait loci across different tissues suggested SLC44A2, ILF3 and AP1M2 as the three most plausible candidate genes for the chromosome 19 locus, our only genome-wide significant thrombosis-related locus that does not harbor likely coagulation-related genes. In addition, we present data showing that this locus also acts as a novel risk factor for stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD). In conclusion, our study reveals novel common genetic risk factors for VTE, stroke and CAD and provides evidence that self-reported data on blood clots used in a GWAS yield results that are comparable with those obtained using clinically diagnosed VTE. This observation opens up the potential for larger meta-analyses, which will enable elucidation of the genetics of thrombotic diseases, and serves as an example for the genetic study of other diseases.	 10486333 21527750 20231535 8560412 20418276 20562444 10823257 26343387 21378990 25625112 9492970 25064009 19782933 25436857 20585627 16270631 21163921 21270443 20686565 22835628 25282103 20080505 25853659 17367492 9545414 23657481 18349091 11380428 7823669 24388013 23041239 21868574 23817569 20981092 1506812 21378988 25772935 19278955 12560220
26859814	Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in a large population-based twin-family sample are predicted by clinically based polygenic scores and by genome-wide SNPs.	Variation in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) has a heritable basis, with genetic association studies starting to yield the first suggestive findings. We contribute to insights into the genetic basis of OCS by performing an extensive series of genetic analyses in a homogeneous, population-based sample from the Netherlands. First, phenotypic and genetic longitudinal correlations over a 6-year period were estimated by modeling OCS data from twins and siblings. Second, polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 6931 subjects with genotype and OCS data were calculated based on meta-analysis results from IOCDF-GC, to investigate their predictive value. Third, the contribution of measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the heritability was estimated using random-effects modeling. Last, we performed an exploratory genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OCS, testing for SNP- and for gene-based associations. Stability in OCS (test-retest correlation 0.63) was mainly explained by genetic stability. The PRS based on clinical samples predicted OCS in our population-based twin-family sample. SNP-based heritability was estimated at 14%. GWAS revealed one SNP (rs8100480), located within the MEF2BNB gene, associated with OCS (P=2.56 × 10(-8)). Additional gene-based testing resulted in four significantly associated genes, which are located in the same chromosomal region on chromosome 19p13.11: MEF2BNB, RFXANK, MEF2BNB-MEF2B and MEF2B. Thus, common genetic variants explained a significant proportion of OCS trait variation. Genes significantly associated with OCS are expressed in the brain and involved in development and control of immune system functions (RFXANK) and regulation of gene expression of muscle-specific genes (MEF2BNB). MEF2BNB also showed a suggestive association with OCD in an independent case-control study, suggesting a role for this gene in the development of OCS. 	 23756893 22889921 17254420 18755814 23258944 20823085 25066062 24821223 22665263 23795679 24204291 23531865 10494449 20623920 22311210 23737753 9464208 22024245 23298648 18188688 25422463 21353194 24695403 24916646 19861150 21833088 21167468 21397060 19571811 22497794 18262706 25518746
26856250	The GRM7 gene, early response to risperidone, and schizophrenia: a genome-wide association study and a confirmatory pharmacogenetic analysis.	The search for biomarkers of response to antipsychotic medications is hindered by difficulties inherent in the topic or related to persistent methodological difficulties, such as high rates of anticipated discontinuation and consequent distortions in the imputation of missing data. Because early response to antipsychotics represents a sufficiently reliable index of the subsequent treatment response in patients with schizophrenia, we undertook a real-world, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the aim of identifying genetic predictors of response to risperidone after 2 weeks in 86 patients with schizophrenia. Limited to the associations reaching significance in the GWAS, confirmatory analysis relative to risperidone response over 9 months was also designed involving 97 patients (European only) enroled in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) genetic substudy. The GWAS revealed a significant association (false discovery rate 0.02) of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2133450 inside the GRM7 gene with Emsley's positive domain derived from the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Patients with the rs2133450 CC genotype presented poorer improvement in the positive domain over 2 weeks, with odds ratios of 12.68 (95% CI, 3.51-45.76) and 6.95 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.37-20.37) compared with patients with the AA and AC genotypes, respectively. Compared with A homozygotes, rs2133450 C homozygotes enroled in the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis showed less improvement in Emsley's positive, excited and depression domains, positive and general PANSS subtypes, and total PANSS after 9 months of treatment with risperidone. The original GWAS and the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis support the proposal that the rs2133450 may have translational relevance as a predictor of response to risperidone.	 16173147 18329248 18180760 15729081 21162693 14594760 21306626 18704095 23421963 19015230 20060416 19351574 15037866 23606027 24862257 20925971 18347602 15000267 21489754 24877683 19890258 18156640 20473064 24813414 22507686 17549063 16079372 20357133 6467925 24429222 22995933 19156168 20967226 19638256 11407439 16172203 20961479 23327578 20227681 21862035 19889950 17287825 18534761 21952670 6152720 18423985 15953491 15289815 17924348 19897823 22955989 20060871 22565785 23810019 10862524 22903391 12648735 21168920 23661632 17388703 15863796 18619473 22054119 21638329 19721433 22187727 21292923 16056390 3616518 14662555 19469725 17234379

26879886	A common variant association study reveals novel susceptibility loci for low HDL-cholesterol levels in ethnic Arabs.	The genetic susceptibility to acquiring low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LHDLC) levels is not completely elucidated yet. In this study, we performed a common variant association study for harboring this trait in ethnic Arabs. We employed the Affymetrix high-density Axiom Genome-Wide ASI Array (Asian population) providing a coverage of 598,000 single nucleotide variations (SNPs) to genotype 5495 individuals in a two-phase study involving discovery and validation sets of experiments. The rs1800775 [1.31 (1.22-1.42); p = 3.41E-12] in the CETP gene and rs359027 [1.26 (1.16-1.36); p = 2.55E-08] in the LMCD1 gene were significantly associated with LHDLC levels. Furthermore, rs3104435 [1.26 (1.15-1.38); p = 1.19E-06] at the MATN1 locus, rs9835344 [1.16 (1.08-1.26); p = 8.75E-06] in the CNTN6 gene, rs1559997 [1.3 (1.14-1.47); p = 9.48E-06] in the SDS gene and rs1670273 [1.2 (1.1-1.31); p = 4.81E-06] in the DMN/SYNM gene exhibited suggestive association with the disorder. Seven other variants including rs1147169 in the PLCL1 gene, rs10248618 in the DNAH11, rs476155 in the GLIS3, rs7024300 in the ABCA1, intergenic rs10836699, rs11603691 in P2RX3 and rs750134 in CORO1C gene exhibited borderline protective properties. Validation and joint meta-analysis resulted in rs1800775, rs3104435 and rs359027 retaining their predisposing properties, while rs10836699 and rs11603691 showed protective properties. Our data show several predisposing variants across the genome for LHDLC levels in ethnic Arabs.	
26888256	Novel genetic predictors of venous thromboembolism risk in African Americans.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common life-threatening cardiovascular condition in the United States, with African Americans (AAs) having a 30% to 60% higher incidence compared with other ethnicities. The mechanisms underlying population differences in the risk of VTE are poorly understood. We conducted the first genome-wide association study in AAs, comprising 578 subjects, followed by replication of highly significant findings in an independent cohort of 159 AA subjects. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between genetic variants and VTE risk. Through bioinformatics analysis of the top signals, we identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in whole blood and investigated the messenger RNA expression differences in VTE cases and controls. We identified and replicated single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 20 (rs2144940, rs2567617, and rs1998081) that increased risk of VTE by 2.3-fold (P< 6 × 10(-7)). These risk variants were found in higher frequency among populations of African descent (>20%) compared with other ethnic groups (<10%). We demonstrate that SNPs on chromosome 20 are cis-eQTLs for thrombomodulin (THBD), and the expression of THBD is lower among VTE cases compared with controls (P= 9.87 × 10(-6)). We have identified novel polymorphisms associated with increased risk of VTE in AAs. These polymorphisms are predominantly found among populations of African descent and are associated with THBD gene expression. Our findings provide new molecular insight into a mechanism regulating VTE susceptibility and identify common genetic variants that increase the risk of VTE in AAs, a population disproportionately affected by this disease.	 22036808 15099278 22384356 18086925 10835412 21737128 21602798 22536799 12859034 22138821 23650146 22820512 14631557 20616382 12871543 2819876 20517342 23755828 23715323 14597978 23080367 19303496 11038326 21980494 21797965 20634204 24801400 22672568 17701901 9851733 21167468 20331949 2827310 25772935 19278955 15104651 21555707 24018621 15842356 19573896

26902266	Genome wide association study of uric acid in Indian population and interaction of identified variants with Type 2 diabetes.	Abnormal level of Serum Uric Acid (SUA) is an important marker and risk factor for complex diseases including Type 2 Diabetes. Since genetic determinant of uric acid in Indians is totally unexplored, we tried to identify common variants associated with SUA in Indians using Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Association of five known variants in SLC2A9 and SLC22A11 genes with SUA level in 4,834 normoglycemics (1,109 in discovery and 3,725 in validation phase) was revealed with different effect size in Indians compared to other major ethnic population of the world. Combined analysis of 1,077 T2DM subjects (772 in discovery and 305 in validation phase) and normoglycemics revealed additional GWAS signal in ABCG2 gene. Differences in effect sizes of ABCG2 and SLC2A9 gene variants were observed between normoglycemics and T2DM patients. We identified two novel variants near long non-coding RNA genes AL356739.1 and AC064865.1 with nearly genome wide significance level. Meta-analysis and in silico replication in 11,745 individuals from AUSTWIN consortium improved association for rs12206002 in AL356739.1 gene to sub-genome wide association level. Our results extends association of SLC2A9, SLC22A11 and ABCG2 genes with SUA level in Indians and enrich the assemblages of evidence for SUA level and T2DM interrelationship. 	 24798721 23418557 20926419 18487473 16293642 21793335 15807535 11807788 23132661 17978310 25268603 12225847 12897447 23785457 20616382 23209189 3343917 23205164 19503597 17977935 18834626 21943158 23263486 21838680 22157498 21584282 20139978 17701901 18327257 23173177 21849023 22797727 12522834 21167468 24513273 18759275 20884846 20015291 24858040 21294900 20053405
26915486	Genetic analysis of advanced glycation end products in the DHS MIND study.	Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a diverse group of molecules produced by the non-enzymatic addition of glucose to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. AGE levels have been associated with hyperglycemia and diabetic complications, especially in animal models, but less clearly in human studies. We measured total serum AGEs using an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) in 506 subjects from 246 families in the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS)/DHS MIND Study (n=399 type 2 diabetes (T2D)-affected). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several candidate genes, including known AGE receptors, were tested for their influence on circulating AGE levels. The genetic analysis was expanded to include an exploratory genome-wide association study (GWAS) and exome chip analysis of AGEs (≈440,000 SNPs). AGEs were found to be highly heritable (h(2)=0.628, p=8.96 × 10(-10)). While no SNPs from candidate genes were significantly associated after Bonferroni correction, rs1035798 in the gene AGER was the most significantly associated (p=0.007). Additionally, rs7198427, in MT1A, showed a nominally significant p-value (p=0.0099). No SNPs from the GWAS or exome studies were identified after correction for multiple comparisons; however, rs17054480 in the PALLD2 gene on chromosome 4 showed the strongest association (p=7.77 × 10(-7)). Five SNPs at two loci (ISCA2/NPC2 and FBXO33) had p-values of less than 2.0 × 10(-5) and three additional SNPs (rs716326 in MACROD2, and rs6795197 and rs6765857 in ZBTB38) showed a nominal association with p-values of less than 1.0 × 10(-5).These findings provide a foundation for further investigation into the genetic component of circulating AGEs.	 24363972 24349550 18182449 23252485 19466753 23721855 11571306 25347204 9186590 24684796 26226616 26296895 17044846 17224333 18460048 12941787 21409311 24634591 25379135 21270199 21455759 24624331 15800289 23780945 8674899 25786107 23642732 11598191 12222959 23378723 24848072 12039445 25149676

26910538	Six Novel Loci Associated with Circulating VEGF Levels Identified by a Meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic and neurotrophic factor, secreted by endothelial cells, known to impact various physiological and disease processes from cancer to cardiovascular disease and to be pharmacologically modifiable. We sought to identify novel loci associated with circulating VEGF levels through a genome-wide association meta-analysis combining data from European-ancestry individuals and using a dense variant map from 1000 genomes imputation panel. Six discovery cohorts including 13,312 samples were analyzed, followed by in-silico and de-novo replication studies including an additional 2,800 individuals. A total of 10 genome-wide significant variants were identified at 7 loci. Four were novel loci (5q14.3, 10q21.3, 16q24.2 and 18q22.3) and the leading variants at these loci were rs114694170 (MEF2C, P = 6.79 x 10(-13)), rs74506613 (JMJD1C, P = 1.17 x 10(-19)), rs4782371 (ZFPM1, P = 1.59 x 10(-9)) and rs2639990 (ZADH2, P = 1.72 x 10(-8)), respectively. We also identified two new independent variants (rs34528081, VEGFA, P = 1.52 x 10(-18); rs7043199, VLDLR-AS1, P = 5.12 x 10(-14)) at the 3 previously identified loci and strengthened the evidence for the four previously identified SNPs (rs6921438, LOC100132354, P = 7.39 x 10(-1467); rs1740073, C6orf223, P = 2.34 x 10(-17); rs6993770, ZFPM2, P = 2.44 x 10(-60); rs2375981, KCNV2, P = 1.48 x 10(-100)). These variants collectively explained up to 52% of the VEGF phenotypic variance. We explored biological links between genes in the associated loci using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis that emphasized their roles in embryonic development and function. Gene set enrichment analysis identified the ERK5 pathway as enriched in genes containing VEGF associated variants. eQTL analysis showed, in three of the identified regions, variants acting as both cis and trans eQTLs for multiple genes. Most of these genes, as well as some of those in the associated loci, were involved in platelet biogenesis and functionality, suggesting the importance of this process in regulation of VEGF levels. This work also provided new insights into the involvement of genes implicated in various angiogenesis related pathologies in determining circulating VEGF levels. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the identified genes affect circulating VEGF levels could be important in the development of novel VEGF-related therapies for such diseases.	 17471570 20032260 21347390 10732896 10926948 12450612 19223316 21757650 22829776 12759245 20648472 25934838 2564731 15258583 7776974 24240613 20714348 22001757 11240667 19073947 10635317 19054372 11978667 22064851 11381259 11118484 11590545 16954806 15003169 19996864 16376520 11176459 17289863 19724058 10070308 20526338 22155946 15304244 20056267 12736564 12483298 20156703 9815613 21060863 17587256 12221099 20616382 9640345 12161364 20935630 15732116 16140937 21356384 11146397 15210553 22197219 11834138 11985729 18682813 15941972 19471318 25673412 15144851 10063933 12131083 21874228 19394248 12874294 17636397 8083342 18450586 18929676 22936694 17701901 15201957 23495172 8643658 1967954 23222517 14657160 23566234 9691082 22139419 21364699 15879308 25648963 19349383 19305408 11437990 1744577 22423221 17479287 20876458 17227476 11592367 12845639 20945384 11705867 10700180 18320069
26912274	Novel loci and pathways significantly associated with longevity.	Only two genome-wide significant loci associated with longevity have been identified so far, probably because of insufficient sample sizes of centenarians, whose genomes may harbor genetic variants associated with health and longevity. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Han Chinese with a sample size 2.7 times the largest previously published GWAS on centenarians. We identified 11 independent loci associated with longevity replicated in Southern-Northern regions of China, including two novel loci (rs2069837-IL6; rs2440012-ANKRD20A9P) with genome-wide significance and the rest with suggestive significance (P < 3.65 × 10(-5)). Eight independent SNPs overlapped across Han Chinese, European and U.S. populations, and APOE and 5q33.3 were replicated as longevity loci. Integrated analysis indicates four pathways (starch, sucrose and xenobiotic metabolism; immune response and inflammation; MAPK; calcium signaling) highly associated with longevity (P ≤ 0.006) in Han Chinese. The association with longevity of three of these four pathways (MAPK; immunity; calcium signaling) is supported by findings in other human cohorts. Our novel finding on the association of starch, sucrose and xenobiotic metabolism pathway with longevity is consistent with the previous results from Drosophilia. This study suggests protective mechanisms including immunity and nutrient metabolism and their interactions with environmental stress play key roles in human longevity.	 14388528 20304771 19944404 11315092 10592173 12359738 21459368 20562875 20884733 16463022 23643377 25199915 24016068 17096597 23020224 24443653 11875555 23064818 15241482 22383865 25589721 22792057 24991952 22892531 25173107 24895270 25814633 17572673 22234866 25629410 24293645 15574588 24739375 15571545 20616382 22279548 22865056 18760393 18728386 15204261 2070900 19424828 20435672 24688116 23715323 22219514 15608231 8058160 24162737 11500818 24076602 22955989 19793722 24977462 17701901 21726414 23300278 23118175 10466675 22171328 10802651 18208327 26202100 12321975 20220756 22641614 12637131 18711139
26911590	Genome-wide association study using family-based cohorts identifies the WLS and CCDC170/ESR1 loci as associated with bone mineral density.	Osteoporosis is a common and debilitating bone disease that is characterised by a low bone mineral density (BMD), a highly heritable trait. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be very successful in identifying common genetic variants associated with BMD adjusted for age, gender and weight, however a large portion of the genetic variance for this trait remains unexplained. There is evidence to suggest significant genetic correlation between body size traits and BMD. It has also recently been suggested that unintended bias can be introduced as a result of adjusting a phenotype for a correlated trait. We performed a GWAS meta-analysis in two populations (total n = 6,696) using BMD data adjusted for only age and gender, in an attempt to identify genetic variants associated with BMD including those that may have potential pleiotropic effects on BMD and body size traits.	 22820512 23074152 23188710 23572186 24013639 25518859 25743335 25954001 25555470 26249818 12478480 12499305 3624485 2816496 1991810 8427042 8090165 7976495 8889855 9060409 9443799 15965027 15711779 16025191 16642434 16862161 17198494 17254428 17903296 18271028 10558910 18455228 18499081 18604206 18505767 19427924 19714249 19841454 19801982 19654370 19841259 20509871 20634204 21167468 21303848 22132199 22064851 21927923 22138821 26367794 26139635 10501797 10893672 11070086 24100690 24056717 24183453 24316577 24487584 24249740 24676807 24430505 24950379 24878039 25640676 22504420 22685416 22706312 22784633

26921259	Smokescreen: a targeted genotyping array for addiction research.	Addictive disorders are a class of chronic, relapsing mental disorders that are responsible for increased risk of mental and medical disorders and represent the largest, potentially modifiable cause of death. Tobacco dependence is associated with increased risk of disease and premature death. While tobacco control efforts and therapeutic interventions have made good progress in reducing smoking prevalence, challenges remain in optimizing their effectiveness based on patient characteristics, including genetic variation. In order to maximize collaborative efforts to advance addiction research, we have developed a genotyping array called Smokescreen. This custom array builds upon previous work in the analyses of human genetic variation, the genetics of addiction, drug metabolism, and response to therapy, with an emphasis on smoking and nicotine addiction.	 24995866 25056061 25072098 25424661 25588294 25642630 26010901 25895022 25869805 26220977 26323059 26440539 26227182 19000709 19381300 19279561 19436041 10802651 10899369 11259349 11768187 12745498 14578134 15229465 1932883 8627511 8937855 18227835 15527659 15734728 16611469 16765148 17112802 17135278 17158188 17924348 17984400 23343064 23362009 23535721 23756893 23979933 24260284 24033696 18385739 18519826 18617085 18565990 18388868 18593715 19180564 19819424 20336063 20418888 20418890 20379614 20829747 20955924 20584212 21167468 21597399 21565264 21690317 22071589 21903159 22025545 22048466 22640768 22451501 22832964 22648373 22524403 23128226 23249876 22641181
26926045	A genome-wide association scan in admixed Latin Americans identifies loci influencing facial and scalp hair features.	We report a genome-wide association scan in over 6,000 Latin Americans for features of scalp hair (shape, colour, greying, balding) and facial hair (beard thickness, monobrow, eyebrow thickness). We found 18 signals of association reaching genome-wide significance (P values 5 × 10(-8) to 3 × 10(-119)), including 10 novel associations. These include novel loci for scalp hair shape and balding, and the first reported loci for hair greying, monobrow, eyebrow and beard thickness. A newly identified locus influencing hair shape includes a Q30R substitution in the Protease Serine S1 family member 53 (PRSS53). We demonstrate that this enzyme is highly expressed in the hair follicle, especially the inner root sheath, and that the Q30R substitution affects enzyme processing and secretion. The genome regions associated with hair features are enriched for signals of selection, consistent with proposals regarding the evolution of human hair. 	 16061697 17919196 26549772 18627299 12111919 20585627 22341974 19803779 23128226 23415221 22693459 23363384 23028347 17728936 25254375 20201958 12923059 26184321 16769906 17351018 18065779 26105758 19681132 23793515 14675213 22820512 24361971 20616382 25722852 17151017 20517342 20056855 26414620 15297300 24743097 16566820 19896111 23992282 23587773 20128222 24267888 23415220 19543368 22509524 22716034 20634204 24565867 19956599 17701901 24894987 21167468 19648217 12853460 23217325 25416281 21307874 18704500 24780931 26410165 18561327 12000732 20127975

26962152	Genome-wide association study of biologically informed periodontal complex traits offers novel insights into the genetic basis of periodontal disease.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronic periodontitis (CP) defined by clinical criteria alone have had modest success to-date. Here, we refine the CP phenotype by supplementing clinical data with biological intermediates of microbial burden (levels of eight periodontal pathogens) and local inflammatory response (gingival crevicular fluid IL-1β) and derive periodontal complex traits (PCTs) via principal component analysis. PCTs were carried forward to GWAS (∼2.5 million markers) to identify PCT-associated loci among 975 European American adult participants of the Dental ARIC study. We sought to validate these findings for CP in the larger ARIC cohort (n = 821 participants with severe CP, 2031-moderate CP, 1914-healthy/mild disease) and an independent German sample including 717 aggressive periodontitis cases and 4210 controls. We identified six PCTs with distinct microbial community/IL-1β structures, although with overlapping clinical presentations. PCT1 was characterized by a uniformly high pathogen load, whereas PCT3 and PCT5 were dominated by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. We detected genome-wide significant signals for PCT1 (CLEC19A, TRA, GGTA2P, TM9SF2, IFI16, RBMS3), PCT4 (HPVC1) and PCT5 (SLC15A4, PKP2, SNRPN). Overall, the highlighted loci included genes associated with immune response and epithelial barrier function. With the exception of associations of BEGAIN with severe and UBE3D with moderate CP, no other loci were associated with CP in ARIC or aggressive periodontitis in the German sample. Although not associated with current clinically determined periodontal disease taxonomies, upon replication and mechanistic validation these candidate loci may highlight dysbiotic microbial community structures and altered inflammatory/immune responses underlying biological sub-types of CP.	 21935407 22736161 2072240 12657001 11128917 11314883 26487758 23574465 23028347 12593599 22675498 22935673 17209786 24024966 17608611 20447254 22483801 21565393 12177636 22699663 23874453 18398418 18052705 21115973 25466412 20354512 15003802 11701471 7891246 22493171 20233392 9133249 22445837 24738590 18086168 25056994 25713100 25211076 25139407 9495612 23134607 24599074 20634204 19961380 18062113 23303375 23639181 20714348 24005976 23459936 11525433 24347629 12027256 1316876 25256105 15295942
26956414	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies discovers multiple loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoid malignancy with strong heritability. To further understand the genetic susceptibility for CLL and identify common loci associated with risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies (GWAS) composed of 3,100 cases and 7,667 controls with follow-up replication in 1,958 cases and 5,530 controls. Here we report three new loci at 3p24.1 (rs9880772, EOMES, P=2.55 × 10(-11)), 6p25.2 (rs73718779, SERPINB6, P=1.97 × 10(-8)) and 3q28 (rs9815073, LPP, P=3.62 × 10(-8)), as well as a new independent SNP at the known 2q13 locus (rs9308731, BCL2L11, P=1.00 × 10(-11)) in the combined analysis. We find suggestive evidence (P<5 × 10(-7)) for two additional new loci at 4q24 (rs10028805, BANK1, P=7.19 × 10(-8)) and 3p22.2 (rs1274963, CSRNP1, P=2.12 × 10(-7)). Pathway analyses of new and known CLL loci consistently show a strong role for apoptosis, providing further evidence for the importance of this biological pathway in CLL susceptibility. 	 17389762 9182691 18204447 18311140 18758461 19084594 19286886 19543373 19557189 20062064 20410501 20576703 20562874 20639881 20981092 20699439 21076068 24145035 11526492 11731797 11984562 14605368 7540117 8929361 10068683 16546095 21131588 21441907 21833088 21329961 22064851 21900951 22700719 23326522 23335087 23703215 23770605 23817569 23782616 24013639 23811543 24149102 24292274 24390342 24879116 25279986 25363670 17873877
26965164	A genome-wide association study of congenital cardiovascular left-sided lesions shows association with a locus on chromosome 20.	Congenital heart defects involving left-sided lesions (LSLs) are relatively common birth defects with substantial morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have suggested a high heritability with a complex genetic architecture, such that only a few LSL loci have been identified. We performed a genome-wide case-control association study to address the role of common variants using a discovery cohort of 778 cases and 2756 controls. We identified a genome-wide significant association mapping to a 200 kb region on chromosome 20q11 [P= 1.72 × 10	 25205790 22638570 22860792 22384356 21962505 16728655 23128226 23610203 23812182 24720490 22752967 12351577 26283027 15690347 23297363 22138821 22969434 17203300 19142209 17729292 23843102 22349727 21345845 25329697 23708191 15342840 24364902 23239837 11404818 24975483 20616382 25722852 21376301 16025100 16007587 7421947 20951801 17936159 19597048 23529168 22851541 18593716 19922871 22939634 17210844 20154144 19644074 20207625 16936225 22422726 12084585 25138779 22955989 10630755 23766104 20634204 19298921 17701901 15390319 21167468 21290564 11470464 20702402 24487584 20562413 22192720 23708190 20926424 25215500 9090774 19543373 24944314 22451605
26955885	Genome-wide association analysis identifies novel loci for chronotype in 100,420 individuals from the UK Biobank.	Our sleep timing preference, or chronotype, is a manifestation of our internal biological clock. Variation in chronotype has been linked to sleep disorders, cognitive and physical performance, and chronic disease. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported chronotype within the UK Biobank cohort (n=100,420). We identify 12 new genetic loci that implicate known components of the circadian clock machinery and point to previously unstudied genetic variants and candidate genes that might modulate core circadian rhythms or light-sensing pathways. Pathway analyses highlight central nervous and ocular systems and fear-response-related processes. Genetic correlation analysis suggests chronotype shares underlying genetic pathways with schizophrenia, educational attainment and possibly BMI. Further, Mendelian randomization suggests that evening chronotype relates to higher educational attainment. These results not only expand our knowledge of the circadian system in humans but also expose the influence of circadian characteristics over human health and life-history variables such as educational attainment. 	 19765810 12826923 22194182 23583112 23703215 26029154 14964706 23628386 23899602 17851696 12841365 23128226 2267475 17218255 26286716 25056061 25642630 15951747 23688114 22064851 10470086 21779176 25386229 22936566 21993624 25135376 19447353 25923181 17572673 23636092 18041481 18797707 19940241 16393707 20517342 26835600 26414676 10458611 24553384 17936039 18038153 20598278 23004349 25642633 9857121 26414678 12015613 23336058 23722424 25831477 23624323 10973318 23757187 17903308 22640616 21167468 18802415 23281716 26423011 25673413 25597830 18076282 25363779 14685227 25492836 12689998
26959369	Benzene Uptake and Glutathione S-transferase T1 Status as Determinants of S-Phenylmercapturic Acid in Cigarette Smokers in the Multiethnic Cohort.	Research from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) demonstrated that, for the same quantity of cigarette smoking, African Americans and Native Hawaiians have a higher lung cancer risk than Whites, while Latinos and Japanese Americans are less susceptible. We collected urine samples from 2,239 cigarette smokers from five different ethnic groups in the MEC and analyzed each sample for S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), a specific biomarker of benzene uptake. African Americans had significantly higher (geometric mean [SE] 3.69 [0.2], p<0.005) SPMA/ml urine than Whites (2.67 [0.13]) while Japanese Americans had significantly lower levels than Whites (1.65 [0.07], p<0.005). SPMA levels in Native Hawaiians and Latinos were not significantly different from those of Whites. We also conducted a genome-wide association study in search of genetic risk factors related to benzene exposure. The glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) deletion explained between 14.2-31.6% (p = 5.4x10-157) and the GSTM1 deletion explained between 0.2%-2.4% of the variance (p = 1.1x10-9) of SPMA levels in these populations. Ethnic differences in levels of SPMA remained strong even after controlling for the effects of these two deletions. These results demonstrate the powerful effect of GSTT1 status on SPMA levels in urine and show that uptake of benzene in African American, White, and Japanese American cigarette smokers is consistent with their lung cancer risk in the MEC. While benzene is not generally considered a cause of lung cancer, its metabolite SPMA could be a biomarker for other volatile lung carcinogens in cigarette smoke. 	 20106900 24281202 21436064 11315092 21323604 19838921 22539395 21300142 12748714 14698566 10413421 14660781 12191893 22138821 18559562 20036650 11700268 1306091 8988725 23934173 19317515 8225730 20100551 19009306 18848868 25293881 20395011 15533900 9625726 24913818 26053186 7287220 11451816 17885617 25542827 25233931 7767992 15935803 18375736 25205215 12082012 11979440 22166497 15591089 9118882 26554337 22014025 20408564 21167468 23837805 22173199 19543373 16436765 10695593

26974007	Analysis of five chronic inflammatory diseases identifies 27 new associations and highlights disease-specific patterns at shared loci.	We simultaneously investigated the genetic landscape of ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis to investigate pleiotropy and the relationship between these clinically related diseases. Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.	 20339032 24718290 25693563 19474294 21297633 16862161 23917628 25939698 24670764 22560090 23128226 17704786 17943122 18606306 25027329 25439723 23752797 25581432 23128233 16498453 19424496 20507892 23603668 25399562 18840781 22843982 25722852 21376301 11809275 20354512 23749187 22446964 24959948 23603763 15591511 21829388 26192919 25559196 25684965 17701901 12789169 26140449 22057235 20212095 22936936 12824425 20453842 20562413 24728037 25597830 21441907 21071422 23143594

27001270	Genetic association and stress mediated down-regulation in trabecular meshwork implicates MPP7 as a novel candidate gene in primary open angle glaucoma.	Glaucoma is the largest cause of irreversible blindness affecting more than 60 million people globally. The disease is defined as a gradual loss of peripheral vision due to death of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC). The RGC death is largely influenced by the rate of aqueous humor production by ciliary processes and its passage through the trabecular meshwork (TM) in the anterior part of the eye. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common subtype, is a genetically complex disease. Multiple genes and many loci have been reported to be involved in POAG but taken together they explain less than 10 % of the patients from a genetic perspective warranting more studies in different world populations. The purpose of this study was to perform genome-wide search for common variants associated with POAG in an east-Indian population.	 1867550 19279691 17332497 19846772 22171069 24038936 18172103 10545602 17242882 22258158 16488940 25173105 23951440 25173107 17960117 18284312 15994659 25389776 17237226 20616382 17589689 21203405 22128243 21498811 12523884 412691 19625503 21058334 24055863 23940637 8695555 20634204 17701901 16520334 24875940 15579465
27005778	Genome-wide study for circulating metabolites identifies 62 loci and reveals novel systemic effects of LPA.	Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci linked with complex diseases, for which the molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. Comprehensive molecular profiling of circulating metabolites captures highly heritable traits, which can help to uncover metabolic pathophysiology underlying established disease variants. We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records. Our findings strengthen the argument for safe LPA-targeted intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk. 	 19474294 25691689 25078778 26210642 21378990 19684899 24316577 19198611 16582909 22286219 20686565 24243886 9362407 25961943 10431659 23715323 24816252 25569235 23032255 19509380 20509871 22899561 21886157 22368281 22331829 22426310 20981092 22327610 22492648 25954001 25064373
27015805	Human longevity is influenced by many genetic variants: evidence from 75,000 UK Biobank participants.	Variation in human lifespan is 20 to 30% heritable in twins but few genetic variants have been identified. We undertook a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using age at death of parents of middle-aged UK Biobank participants of European decent (n=75,244 with father's and/or mother's data, excluding early deaths). Genetic risk scores for 19 phenotypes (n=777 proven variants) were also tested. In GWAS, a nicotine receptor locus(CHRNA3, previously associated with increased smoking and lung cancer) was associated with fathers' survival. Less common variants requiring further confirmation were also identified. Offspring of longer lived parents had more protective alleles for coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's disease. In candidate analyses, variants in the TOMM40/APOE locus were associated with longevity, but FOXO variants were not. Associations between extreme longevity (mother >=98 years, fathers >=95 years, n=1,339) and disease alleles were similar, with an additional association with HDL cholesterol (p=5.7x10-3). These results support a multiple protective factors model influencing lifespan and longevity (top 1% survival) in humans, with prominent roles for cardiovascular-related pathways. Several of these genetically influenced risks, including blood pressure and tobacco exposure, are potentially modifiable. 	 20634204 20921414 20512403 18311140 17701901 17459456 17434289 17365875 16602826 16463022 9097728 8786073 474565 11982670 11503162 26677855 26523775 25855712 25882670 25664523 25642633 24732145 25199915 21098774 21191145 21418511 21612516 21740922 22279548 22533364 23401516 23051975 23535734 23746838 23685624 24097068 24718290 24688116 25417146

27022141	Original Research: A case-control genome-wide association study identifies genetic modifiers of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders that have in common a mutation in the sixth codon of the β-globin (HBB) gene on chromosome 11. However, people with the same genetic mutation display a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is an important genetic modifier of SCD complications leading to milder symptoms and improved long-term survival. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a case-control experimental design in 244 African Americans with SCD to discover genetic factors associated with HbF expression. The case group consisted of subjects with HbF≥8.6% (133 samples) and control group subjects with HbF≤£3.1% (111 samples). Our GWAS results replicated SNPs previously identified in an erythroid-specific enhancer region located in the second intron of the BCL11A gene associated with HbF expression. In addition, we identified SNPs in the SPARC, GJC1, EFTUD2 and JAZF1 genes as novel candidates associated with HbF levels. To gain insights into mechanisms of globin gene regulation in the HBB locus, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses were conducted. We observed strong LD in the low HbF group in contrast to a loss of LD and greater number of haplotypes in the high HbF group. A search of known HBB locus regulatory elements identified SNPs 5' of δ-globin located in an HbF silencing region. In particular, SNP rs4910736 created a binding site for a known transcription repressor GFi1 which is a candidate protein for further investigation. Another HbF-associated SNP, rs2855122 in the cAMP response element upstream of Gγ-globin, was analyzed for functional relevance. Studies performed with siRNA-mediated CREB binding protein (CBP) knockdown in primary erythroid cells demonstrated γ-globin activation and HbF induction, supporting a repressor role for CBP. This study identifies possible molecular determinants of HbF production.	 7508688 24614105 2432426 23576758 24667352 2001460 9074425 19861239 17918249 18691915 3432268 10592257 17943122 12605547 25084696 2419279 17625608 21539536 24223142 15730849 2435339 19148297 24115442 9029641 23406172 2441778 21308769 19056937 21078662 18667698 22936743 22305528 7519102 20861919 22641398 21998251 20195270 20018918 20676099 3456593 22139998 15297300 18245381 16861354 7966354 16896160 24800817 17767159 15205260 7517214 1724976 21497119 3440386 10721987 8528252 17592125 26393293 26619147 15040424 12384857 7993409 18829352 23328127 17701901 21879898 25069958 18372903 15385956 20395365 24585758 22010104 20676097 26447191 20492708 25372704 24598056 25703683 1710777
27020472	Meta-analysis of gene-environment-wide association scans accounting for education level identifies additional loci for refractive error.	Myopia is the most common human eye disorder and it results from complex genetic and environmental causes. The rapidly increasing prevalence of myopia poses a major public health challenge. Here, the CREAM consortium performs a joint meta-analysis to test single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) main effects and SNP × education interaction effects on refractive error in 40,036 adults from 25 studies of European ancestry and 10,315 adults from 9 studies of Asian ancestry. In European ancestry individuals, we identify six novel loci (FAM150B-ACP1, LINC00340, FBN1, DIS3L-MAP2K1, ARID2-SNAT1 and SLC14A2) associated with refractive error. In Asian populations, three genome-wide significant loci AREG, GABRR1 and PDE10A also exhibit strong interactions with education (P<8.5 × 10(-5)), whereas the interactions are less evident in Europeans. The discovery of these loci represents an important advance in understanding how gene and environment interactions contribute to the heterogeneity of myopia. 	 20616382 20630598 20851442 21181894 21293137 22581228 22820512 22836762 22955616 22941192 23284291 23938127 24142238 24014484 24637483 25211393 25954003 10937558 11081523 11211020 11315092 11594942 11683525 11818374 12045153 12454029 12628451 12939312 15078666 15326098 8436895 8541880 9303304 23468642 22507742 23474145 23500522 23722424 23644222 23946634 24086484 23672971 22064851 22018046 22559900 22491403 21155761 20212493 21527992 21589913 21436268 23322575 23110994 23186635 23396134 9566019 15456762 15611866 15829855 15987797 16079001 16101943 16723438 17210850 17365815 17384015 19506196 19543373 20576703
27021288	Genome-wide analyses of aggressiveness in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.	Aggressiveness is a behavioral trait that has the potential to be harmful to individuals and society. With an estimated heritability of about 40%, genetics is important in its development. We performed an exploratory genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of childhood aggressiveness in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to gain insight into the underlying biological processes associated with this trait. Our primary sample consisted of 1,060 adult ADHD patients (aADHD). To further explore the genetic architecture of childhood aggressiveness, we performed enrichment analyses of suggestive genome-wide associations observed in aADHD among GWA signals of dimensions of oppositionality (defiant/vindictive and irritable dimensions) in childhood ADHD (cADHD). No single polymorphism reached genome-wide significance (P < 5.00E-08). The strongest signal in aADHD was observed at rs10826548, within a long noncoding RNA gene (beta = -1.66, standard error (SE) = 0.34, P = 1.07E-06), closely followed by rs35974940 in the neurotrimin gene (beta = 3.23, SE = 0.67, P = 1.26E-06). The top GWA SNPs observed in aADHD showed significant enrichment of signals from both the defiant/vindictive dimension (Fisher's P-value = 2.28E-06) and the irritable dimension in cADHD (Fisher's P-value = 0.0061). In sum, our results identify a number of biologically interesting markers possibly underlying childhood aggressiveness and provide targets for further genetic exploration of aggressiveness across psychiatric disorders. © 2016 The Authors.

27206850	Genome-Wide Association Study of Bladder Cancer in a Chinese Cohort Reveals a New Susceptibility Locus at 5q12.3.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of bladder cancer have identified a number of susceptibility loci in European populations but have yet to uncover the genetic determinants underlying bladder cancer incidence among other ethnicities. Therefore, we performed the first GWAS in a Chinese cohort comprising 3,406 cases of bladder cancer and 4,645 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus for bladder cancer at 5q12.3, located in the intron of CWC27 (rs2042329), that was significantly associated with disease risk (OR = 1.40; P = 4.61 × 10(-11)). However, rs2042329 was not associated with bladder cancer risk in patients of European descent. The rs2042329 risk allele was also related to significantly increased expression levels of CWC27 mRNA and protein in bladder cancer tissues from Chinese patients. Additional functional analyses suggested that CWC27 played an oncogenic role in bladder cancer by inducing cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. In conclusion, the identification of a risk-associated locus at 5q12.3 provides new insights into the inherited susceptibility to bladder cancer in Chinese populations and may help to identify high-risk individuals.

27023175	Genome-wide association study of lifetime cannabis use based on a large meta-analytic sample of 32 330 subjects from the International Cannabis Consortium.	Cannabis is the most widely produced and consumed illicit psychoactive substance worldwide. Occasional cannabis use can progress to frequent use, abuse and dependence with all known adverse physical, psychological and social consequences. Individual differences in cannabis initiation are heritable (40-48%). The International Cannabis Consortium was established with the aim to identify genetic risk variants of cannabis use. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data of 13 cohorts (N=32 330) and four replication samples (N=5627). In addition, we performed a gene-based test of association, estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and explored the genetic correlation between lifetime cannabis use and cigarette use using LD score regression. No individual SNPs reached genome-wide significance. Nonetheless, gene-based tests identified four genes significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use: NCAM1, CADM2, SCOC and KCNT2. Previous studies reported associations of NCAM1 with cigarette smoking and other substance use, and those of CADM2 with body mass index, processing speed and autism disorders, which are phenotypes previously reported to be associated with cannabis use. Furthermore, we showed that, combined across the genome, all common SNPs explained 13-20% (P<0.001) of the liability of lifetime cannabis use. Finally, there was a strong genetic correlation (rg=0.83; P=1.85 × 10(-8)) between lifetime cannabis use and lifetime cigarette smoking implying that the SNP effect sizes of the two traits are highly correlated. This is the largest meta-analysis of cannabis GWA studies to date, revealing important new insights into the genetic pathways of lifetime cannabis use. Future functional studies should explore the impact of the identified genes on the biological mechanisms of cannabis use.	 20047801 25987507 15236825 20936991 18705688 17761687 23128226 24650814 19413562 25273375 24146854 10789303 25642630 15893102 21618601 21996756 21168125 19662925 19937978 24143882 18519825 20418888 18434921 19717242 18519829 26295084 10829325 20616382 20935630 25287883 22823124 16402286 18606503 21507154 26414676 17169504 26103030 21668797 23303482 17081504 9843121 25285897 19812666 23958962 17135278 24904437 12915661 15370155 18727688 20418889 17701901 25869804 14760737 22177896 19207351 21167468 18828801 21397060 26308966 24739678 17085484 22958900 25162899 20402985 19032539 22777127 19335651

27029810	Variants near CHRNA3/5 and APOE have age- and sex-related effects on human lifespan.	Lifespan is a trait of enormous personal interest. Research into the biological basis of human lifespan, however, is hampered by the long time to death. Using a novel approach of regressing (272,081) parental lifespans beyond age 40 years on participant genotype in a new large data set (UK Biobank), we here show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan. The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE ɛ4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan (P=4.2 × 10(-15), effect -1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent; sex difference, P=0.011), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affecting paternal lifespan (P=4.8 × 10(-11), effect -0.86 years per allele; sex difference P=0.075). Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.3-3.7 years shorter lives. 	 22384356 16511556 8786073 25199915 10408179 25056061 24623176 20849521 8136829 23022100 25282103 26423011 24497847 12198535 18385738 9665378 22837378 24688116 20336132 19300482 24816252 18385739 19060911 24586121 17878422 9778168 23207651 21418511 24518929 25072098 25826379 17701901 23269371 18414406 8346443 21740922

So far, more than 170 loci have been associated with circulating lipid levels through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These associations are largely driven by common variants, their function is often not known, and many are likely to be markers for the causal variants. In this study we aimed to identify more new rare and low-frequency functional variants associated with circulating lipid levels.	 24097068 25751400 25470054 17322881 15733741 19602639 16269245 24941081 20686565 20676075 20354512 23160641 25961943 25487149 14985368 16890538 15052411 21167468 16885160
27064256	Genome-wide association study identifies five new susceptibility loci for primary angle closure glaucoma.	Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by replication in a combined total of 10,503 PACG cases and 29,567 controls drawn from 24 countries across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. We observed significant evidence of disease association at five new genetic loci upon meta-analysis of all patient collections. These loci are at EPDR1 rs3816415 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, P = 5.94 × 10(-15)), CHAT rs1258267 (OR = 1.22, P = 2.85 × 10(-16)), GLIS3 rs736893 (OR = 1.18, P = 1.43 × 10(-14)), FERMT2 rs7494379 (OR = 1.14, P = 3.43 × 10(-11)), and DPM2-FAM102A rs3739821 (OR = 1.15, P = 8.32 × 10(-12)). We also confirmed significant association at three previously described loci (P < 5 × 10(-8) for each sentinel SNP at PLEKHA7, COL11A1, and PCMTD1-ST18), providing new insights into the biology of PACG. 	 24144296 16715098 19561604 21131975 21732829 17301614 25706626 23857544 21532571 22922875 16488940 25861811 25173105 22064851 22544366 25173107 19680787 11673287 23920366 22955616 19561607 14500813 20935630 24390342 22158537 23396134 8933969 19597491 25057993 10922206 19430480 22446964 23715323 11943480 14605097 7704921 23109149 25173106 22955989 24603532 21292315 25305756 11815354 25217961 25383971 22570617 11673284 20081858 24013639 10964834
27046643	Genome-wide association study of cognitive functions and educational attainment in UK Biobank (N=112 151).	People's differences in cognitive functions are partly heritable and are associated with important life outcomes. Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies of cognitive functions have found evidence for polygenic effects yet, to date, there are few replicated genetic associations. Here we use data from the UK Biobank sample to investigate the genetic contributions to variation in tests of three cognitive functions and in educational attainment. GWA analyses were performed for verbal-numerical reasoning (N=36 035), memory (N=112 067), reaction time (N=111 483) and for the attainment of a college or a university degree (N=111 114). We report genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based associations in 20 genomic regions, and significant gene-based findings in 46 regions. These include findings in the ATXN2, CYP2DG, APBA1 and CADM2 genes. We report replication of these hits in published GWA studies of cognitive function, educational attainment and childhood intelligence. There is also replication, in UK Biobank, of SNP hits reported previously in GWA studies of educational attainment and cognitive function. GCTA-GREML analyses, using common SNPs (minor allele frequency>0.01), indicated significant SNP-based heritabilities of 31% (s.e.m.=1.8%) for verbal-numerical reasoning, 5% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for memory, 11% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for reaction time and 21% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for educational attainment. Polygenic score analyses indicate that up to 5% of the variance in cognitive test scores can be predicted in an independent cohort. The genomic regions identified include several novel loci, some of which have been associated with intracranial volume, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.	 22665492 26240470 25644384 25335893 20562875 23128226 15200238 19645588 12061405 25642630 19047528 23927501 19488046 26168413 16594792 24936253 25550326 25607358 22463865 12079279 25951819 18615557 26203819 23358156 17572673 25754083 25287667 20504860 23968918 22689718 24563565 25282103 8981950 20145623 26809841 25885710 25201988 9438377 8896556 23535033 24944428 1326532 17589504 21826061 25288728 24162737 23722424 18053258 19294424 16721405 22955989 23490758 24742670 17701901 25869804 15660853 10580126 24349000 9763676 25648963 25597830 25126397 22700061 25224258 24357886 24399044 17014726 24604063
27043157	A Genome-Wide Test of the Differential Susceptibility Hypothesis Reveals a Genetic Predictor of Differential Response to Psychological Treatments for Child Anxiety Disorders.	The differential susceptibly hypothesis suggests that certain genetic variants moderate the effects of both negative and positive environments on mental health and may therefore be important predictors of response to psychological treatments. Nevertheless, the identification of such variants has so far been limited to preselected candidate genes. In this study we extended the differential susceptibility hypothesis from a candidate gene to a genome-wide approach to test whether a polygenic score of environmental sensitivity predicted response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in children with anxiety disorders.	 21847802 12869766 17112647 26294368 24364831 16934775 9255702 23845064 20428936 23031429 23555274 25640827 19152496 26004660 22138391 25663728 19883141 19015237 24683521 22024766 23377640 22937132 23565138 21282783 24860514 22905861 23733328 9741678 23110994 17513985 23772677 25116690 22198824 22133521 24925986 7726811 24342838 10834478 24074471 22833190 25640837 20573579 24732705
27018472	A Genome-wide Association Study of Nonsyndromic Cleft Palate Identifies an Etiologic Missense Variant in GRHL3.	Cleft palate (CP) is a common birth defect occurring in 1 in 2,500 live births. Approximately half of infants with CP have a syndromic form, exhibiting other physical and cognitive disabilities. The other half have nonsyndromic CP, and to date, few genes associated with risk for nonsyndromic CP have been characterized. To identify such risk factors, we performed a genome-wide association study of this disorder. We discovered a genome-wide significant association with a missense variant in GRHL3 (p.Thr454Met [c.1361C>T]; rs41268753; p = 4.08 × 10(-9)) and replicated the result in an independent sample of case and control subjects. In both the discovery and replication samples, rs41268753 conferred increased risk for CP (OR = 8.3, 95% CI 4.1-16.8; OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.43-3.27, respectively). In luciferase transactivation assays, p.Thr454Met had about one-third of the activity of wild-type GRHL3, and in zebrafish embryos, perturbed periderm development. We conclude that this mutation is an etiologic variant for nonsyndromic CP and is one of few functional variants identified to date for nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. This finding advances our understanding of the genetic basis of craniofacial development and might ultimately lead to improvements in recurrence risk prediction, treatment, and prognosis. 	 8900224 24360809 19013452 16926217 21618603 15831758 8916367 21290562 20023658 12219090 20718045 25704602 24915580 24563486 26346622 18836445 21295280 3422594 17446874 26566670 17259187 21331089 25691422 15317890 21081122 25775280 22863734 13339079 20643356 24124047 11775787 19747722 19812666 14608380 820824 20634204 20358594 17701901 2309700 20436469 23269371 10982956 15845037 22931925 16556802 25428349 19543373

27064253	Mosaic loss of chromosome Y is associated with common variation near TCL1A.	Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) leading to gonosomal XY/XO commonly occurs during aging, particularly in smokers. We investigated whether mLOY was associated with non-hematological cancer in three prospective cohorts (8,679 cancer cases and 5,110 cancer-free controls) and genetic susceptibility to mLOY. Overall, mLOY was observed in 7% of men, and its prevalence increased with age (per-year odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-1.15; P < 2 × 10(-16)), reaching 18.7% among men over 80 years old. mLOY was associated with current smoking (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.82-3.03; P = 5.55 × 10(-11)), but the association weakened with years after cessation. mLOY was not consistently associated with overall or specific cancer risk (for example, bladder, lung or prostate cancer) nor with cancer survival after diagnosis (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.73-1.04; P = 0.12). In a genome-wide association study, we observed the first example of a common susceptibility locus for genetic mosaicism, specifically mLOY, which maps to TCL1A at 14q32.13, marked by rs2887399 (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.36-1.78; P = 1.37 × 10(-10)).	 10564581 24246702 12815422 4116908 1384666 8076356 7485166 9520462 10197258 13964326 16899659 17597780 24777449 25326804 25426837 25426838 25477213 25748358 26139635 26678315 18067786 18684036 19166990 19287382 19287384 19287385 19648920 19440215 19812545 20972438 21586113 22561516 22561519 10983986
27067015	Genome-wide analysis of over 106 000 individuals identifies 9 neuroticism-associated loci.	Neuroticism is a personality trait of fundamental importance for psychological well-being and public health. It is strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and several other psychiatric conditions. Although neuroticism is heritable, attempts to identify the alleles involved in previous studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes. Here we report a combined meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) of neuroticism that includes 91 370 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, 6659 participants from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and 8687 participants from a QIMR (Queensland Institute of Medical Research) Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR) cohort. All participants were assessed using the same neuroticism instrument, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R-S) Short Form's Neuroticism scale. We found a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability estimate for neuroticism of ∼15% (s.e.=0.7%). Meta-analysis identified nine novel loci associated with neuroticism. The strongest evidence for association was at a locus on chromosome 8 (P=1.5 × 10(-15)) spanning 4 Mb and containing at least 36 genes. Other associated loci included interesting candidate genes on chromosome 1 (GRIK3 (glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 3)), chromosome 4 (KLHL2 (Kelch-like protein 2)), chromosome 17 (CRHR1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) and MAPT (microtubule-associated protein Tau)) and on chromosome 18 (CELF4 (CUGBP elav-like family member 4)). We found no evidence for genetic differences in the common allelic architecture of neuroticism by sex. By comparing our findings with those of the Psychiatric Genetics Consortia, we identified a strong genetic correlation between neuroticism and MDD and a less strong but significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia, although not with bipolar disorder. Polygenic risk scores derived from the primary UK Biobank sample captured ∼1% of the variance in neuroticism in the GS:SFHS and QIMR samples, although most of the genome-wide significant alleles identified within a UK Biobank-only GWAS of neuroticism were not independently replicated within these cohorts. The identification of nine novel neuroticism-associated loci will drive forward future work on the neurobiology of neuroticism and related phenotypes.	 20921124 25644384 26186755 19251871 22384356 21549840 20562875 25056061 25642630 25993607 19386277 24687194 17671280 26169973 25132410 23025612 24828478 10397770 26176920 23149448 21257974 21926972 19748081 24298146 26414676 8215811 23209433 20804236 26368830 19732485 17903109 22472876 21047157 26324098 16784347 22832902 20655099 16958029 19221446 23672542 15009664 11513380 23269371 27115122 18660810 16273321 21167468 21827775 22057216 19900610 24525762 23835198 25826379 19449983 20607795 17014726 11105396 15715669
27207532	New Locus for Skin Intrinsic Fluorescence in Type 1 Diabetes Also Associated With Blood and Skin Glycated Proteins.	Skin fluorescence (SF) noninvasively measures advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the skin and is a risk indicator for diabetes complications. N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is the only known locus influencing SF. We aimed to identify additional genetic loci influencing SF in type 1 diabetes (T1D) through a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (N = 1,359) including Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) and Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR). A locus on chromosome 1, rs7533564 (P = 1.9 × 10(-9)), was associated with skin intrinsic fluorescence measured by SCOUT DS (excitation 375 nm, emission 435-655 nm), which remained significant after adjustment for time-weighted HbA1c (P = 1.7 × 10(-8)). rs7533564 was associated with mean HbA1c in meta-analysis (P = 0.0225), mean glycated albumin (P = 0.0029), and glyoxal hydroimidazolones (P = 0.049), an AGE measured in skin biopsy collagen, in DCCT. rs7533564 was not associated with diabetes complications in DCCT/EDIC or with SF in subjects without diabetes (nondiabetic [ND]) (N = 8,721). In conclusion, we identified a new locus associated with SF in T1D subjects that did not show similar effect in ND subjects, suggesting a diabetes-specific effect. This association needs to be investigated in type 2 diabetes.	 26407758 10548540 23813757 19274450 26192006 15243705 16249432 22937960 25187362 25814214 22187444 12378389 19414839 10102706 20388043 21246217 21568748 8366922 26341632 24500109 18039805 25411062 22851597 10976109 20634204 23882708 23153673 22484488 20981092 25798622 23643347 24934506 19543373 17130200 21307380
27082954	Genetic Variants in the Bone Morphogenic Protein Gene Family Modify the Association between Residential Exposure to Traffic and Peripheral Arterial Disease.	There is a growing literature indicating that genetic variants modify many of the associations between environmental exposures and clinical outcomes, potentially by increasing susceptibility to these exposures. However, genome-scale investigations of these interactions have been rarely performed particularly in the case of air pollution exposures. We performed race-stratified genome-wide gene-environment interaction association studies on European-American (EA, N = 1623) and African-American (AA, N = 554) cohorts to investigate the joint influence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and residential exposure to traffic ("traffic exposure")-a recognized vascular disease risk factor-on peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Traffic exposure was estimated via the distance from the primary residence to the nearest major roadway, defined as the nearest limited access highways or major arterial. The rs755249-traffic exposure interaction was associated with PAD at a genome-wide significant level (P = 2.29x10-8) in European-Americans. Rs755249 is located in the 3' untranslated region of BMP8A, a member of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) gene family. Further investigation revealed several variants in BMP genes associated with PAD via an interaction with traffic exposure in both the EA and AA cohorts; this included interactions with non-synonymous variants in BMP2, which is regulated by air pollution exposure. The BMP family of genes is linked to vascular growth and calcification and is a novel gene family for the study of PAD pathophysiology. Further investigation of BMP8A using the Genotype Tissue Expression Database revealed multiple variants with nominally significant (P < 0.05) interaction P-values in our EA cohort were significant BMP8A eQTLs in tissue types highlight relevant for PAD such as rs755249 (tibial nerve, eQTL P = 3.6x10-6) and rs1180341 (tibial artery, eQTL P = 5.3x10-6). Together these results reveal a novel gene, and possibly gene family, associated with PAD via an interaction with traffic air pollution exposure. These results also highlight the potential for interactions studies, particularly at the genome scale, to reveal novel biology linking environmental exposures to clinical outcomes. 	 10691098 22739687 12881445 25954001 25954002 25954003 26229139 25807578 26293462 26404484 26404488 26540294 26271459 26471266 26613345 12883005 15514657 2369997 9463357 16037577 16377937 16862161 17607002 17638927 17705810 17656669 18007994 18067449 17955261 18385739 19007695 18818419 19057697 19194299 19136372 19318540 19506111 19502096 19554969 19604064 20458016 20619221 20616382 20576934 20634204 21079651 11125122 12163701 21164079 21414469 21385671 21571904 21907184 21515291 22223731 22363399 22419069 22955617 23482648 24098343 24076600 12401246
27094239	Four Susceptibility Loci for Gallstone Disease Identified in a Meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 280 cases identified the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 as a locus associated with risk for gallstone disease, but findings have not been reported from any other GWAS of this phenotype. We performed a large-scale, meta-analysis of GWASs of individuals of European ancestry with available prior genotype data, to identify additional genetic risk factors for gallstone disease.	 18974171 9017506 23753274 20167617 12035041 16490960 22898925 20529992 16844493 25613900 17087948 4629238 7601405 22064851 2646917 20837016 1682550 1833235 24973796 19414484 25920552 20686565 22736164 24657701 12958120 20616382 14504269 18070814 474565 17127183 17450525 11208732 9065374 24816252 23263486 21691098 17632509 7373460 12093894 9034160 22885924 11074014 15747383 21750032 21167468 20362271 21533175 24256507 3062787 5645851 26386597
27089181	Genetic variants associated with subjective well-being, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism identified through genome-wide analyses.	Very few genetic variants have been associated with depression and neuroticism, likely because of limitations on sample size in previous studies. Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes (|ρ^| ≈ 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for association.	 18763692 21685912 25391945 24671021 20823223 20562875 25056061 25642630 25993607 17943122 22064851 12093424 25581432 24316577 20643630 19728071 10654668 26430803 21257974 25282103 27067015 25201988 22751100 25672393 23186620 23298648 23715323 19732485 23471543 26414678 22472876 25673412 21044948 24762786 2395194 11290733 21826059 21407268 10909953 19060906 18315789 25826379 18208329 21906891 25954001
27207650	Genome-wide association study of colorectal cancer in Hispanics.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 58 susceptibility alleles across 37 regions associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) with P < 5×10(-8) Most studies have been conducted in non-Hispanic whites and East Asians; however, the generalizability of these findings and the potential for ethnic-specific risk variation in Hispanic and Latino (HL) individuals have been largely understudied. We describe the first GWAS of common genetic variation contributing to CRC risk in HL (1611 CRC cases and 4330 controls). We also examine known susceptibility alleles and implement imputation-based fine-mapping to identify potential ethnicity-specific association signals in known risk regions. We discovered 17 variants across 4 independent regions that merit further investigation due to suggestive CRC associations (P < 1×10(-6)) at 1p34.3 (rs7528276; Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.86 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.47-2.36); P = 2.5×10(-7)], 2q23.3 (rs1367374; OR = 1.37 (95% CI: 1.21-1.55); P = 4.0×10(-7)), 14q24.2 (rs143046984; OR = 1.65 (95% CI: 1.36-2.01); P = 4.1×10(-7)) and 16q12.2 [rs142319636; OR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.37-2.08); P=7.8×10(-7)]. Among the 57 previously published CRC susceptibility alleles with minor allele frequency ≥1%, 76.5% of SNPs had a consistent direction of effect and 19 (33.3%) were nominally statistically significant (P < 0.05). Further, rs185423955 and rs60892987 were identified as novel secondary susceptibility variants at 3q26.2 (P = 5.3×10(-5)) and 11q12.2 (P = 6.8×10(-5)), respectively. Our findings demonstrate the importance of fine mapping in HL. These results are informative for variant prioritization in functional studies and future risk prediction modeling in minority populations.	 25220842 23955597 24390345 15024028 25023989 16862161 17618282 18084292 19402167 21655089 23128226 25375357 17982118 23505323 17630503 21129217 16601428 21242260 23555291 23446420 24448986 10891514 23263487 22634755 24760767 24292274 23022100 21531788 23851122 26187503 22072618 19011631 15630453 23426880 23722565 15088270 23266556 25105248 24509480 16815997 22076443 23086126 20972440 21295697 17618283 24836286 19147581 17618284 17044734 20634204 23535734 17701901 21761138 24094745 19043597 23334005 24163127 24737748 24700103 20981092 18372905 21708826 17934461 21863284 20937854 25327703 24886709 18372901 20012581 19543373 22542749 10873615 26151821 10695593 24518838
27089180	Physical and neurobehavioral determinants of reproductive onset and success.	The ages of puberty, first sexual intercourse and first birth signify the onset of reproductive ability, behavior and success, respectively. In a genome-wide association study of 125,667 UK Biobank participants, we identify 38 loci associated (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with age at first sexual intercourse. These findings were taken forward in 241,910 men and women from Iceland and 20,187 women from the Women's Genome Health Study. Several of the identified loci also exhibit associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with other reproductive and behavioral traits, including age at first birth (variants in or near ESR1 and RBM6-SEMA3F), number of children (CADM2 and ESR1), irritable temperament (MSRA) and risk-taking propensity (CADM2). Mendelian randomization analyses infer causal influences of earlier puberty timing on earlier first sexual intercourse, earlier first birth and lower educational attainment. In turn, likely causal consequences of earlier first sexual intercourse include reproductive, educational, psychiatric and cardiometabolic outcomes.	 24919537 25526766 26084728 25907653 16603089 26523775 17540666 14570750 17952075 25807286 25056061 25900066 21679172 22064851 17502808 20585627 26548314 23131671 20644199 17572673 10600740 23927712 25854890 25282103 22781858 20954458 18070814 20353570 25636818 18775817 26414676 24553384 24613987 12187549 24920784 16311040 11867705 15554900 25642633 9393999 23290997 20403867 25231870 25826379 25869804 557480 25673413 20358457 21860629 24739975
27197191	Cross-Cancer Genome-Wide Analysis of Lung, Ovary, Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Reveals Novel Pleiotropic Associations.	Identifying genetic variants with pleiotropic associations can uncover common pathways influencing multiple cancers. We took a two-stage approach to conduct genome-wide association studies for lung, ovary, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from the GAME-ON/GECCO Network (61,851 cases, 61,820 controls) to identify pleiotropic loci. Findings were replicated in independent association studies (55,789 cases, 330,490 controls). We identified a novel pleiotropic association at 1q22 involving breast and lung squamous cell carcinoma, with eQTL analysis showing an association with ADAM15/THBS3 gene expression in lung. We also identified a known breast cancer locus CASP8/ALS2CR12 associated with prostate cancer, a known cancer locus at CDKN2B-AS1 with different variants associated with lung adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, and confirmed the associations of a breast BRCA2 locus with lung and serous ovarian cancer. This is the largest study to date examining pleiotropy across multiple cancer-associated loci, identifying common mechanisms of cancer development and progression.

27098658	Antiphospholipid antibodies in a large population-based cohort: genome-wide associations and effects on monocyte gene expression.	The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterised by venous and/or arterial thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in women combined with the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). We aimed to identify genetic factors associated with the presence of aPL in a population based cohort. Furthermore, we wanted to clarify if the presence of aPL affects gene expression in circulating monocytes. Titres of IgG and IgM against cardiolipin, β2glycoprotein 1 (anti-β2GPI), and IgG against domain 1 of β2GPI (anti-domain 1) were determined in approx. 5,000 individuals from the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) a population based cohort of German descent. Genotyping was conducted on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. Monocyte gene expression was determined in a subgroup of 1,279 individuals by using the Illumina HT-12 v3 BeadChip. Gene expression data were confirmed in vitro and ex vivo by qRT-PCR. Genome wide analysis revealed significant associations of anti-β2GPI IgG and APOH on chromosome 17, which had been previously identified by candidate gene approaches, and of anti-domain1 and MACROD2 on chromosome 20 which has been listed in a previous GWAS as a suggestive locus associated with the occurrence of anti-β2GPI antibodies. Expression analysis confirmed increased expression of TNFα in monocytes and identified and confirmed neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as a novel gene induced by aPL. In conclusion, MACROD2 represents a novel genetic locus associated with aPL. Furthermore, we show that aPL induce the expression of NAV3 in monocytes and endothelial cells. This will stimulate further research into the role of these genes in the APS.

27117709	Identification of four novel susceptibility loci for oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer.	Common variants in 94 loci have been associated with breast cancer including 15 loci with genome-wide significant associations (P<5 × 10(-8)) with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer and BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk. In this study, to identify new ER-negative susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisting of 4,939 ER-negative cases and 14,352 controls, combined with 7,333 ER-negative cases and 42,468 controls and 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers genotyped on the iCOGS array. We identify four previously unidentified loci including two loci at 13q22 near KLF5, a 2p23.2 locus near WDR43 and a 2q33 locus near PPIL3 that display genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer. In addition, 19 known breast cancer risk loci have genome-wide significant associations and 40 had moderate associations (P<0.05) with ER-negative disease. Using functional and eQTL studies we implicate TRMT61B and WDR43 at 2p23.2 and PPIL3 at 2q33 in ER-negative breast cancer aetiology. All ER-negative loci combined account for ∼11% of familial relative risk for ER-negative disease and may contribute to improved ER-negative and BRCA1 breast cancer risk prediction.	 24493630 24325915 24885402 25086665 25168388 25751625 25919761 26098869 19219042 18193043 18438407 17529967 17529974 10944226 11433524 12111919 8371466 9701363 16033833 16682732 17466083 17384015 17529973 23550210 23900074 24388359 23544013 23535733 19330027 19330030 20101243 20299548 20453838 20616382 20852631 21263130 22044755 22037553 22144499 22267197 22331459 22588877 22820512 22348646 23000897 23128226 22976474 23535729 23535731
27126917	Genome-wide association analysis of actigraphic sleep phenotypes in the LIFE Adult Study.	The genetic basis of sleep is still poorly understood. Despite the moderate to high heritability of sleep-related phenotypes, known genetic variants explain only a small proportion of the phenotypical variance. However, most previous studies were based solely upon self-report measures. The present study aimed to conduct the first genome-wide association (GWA) of actigraphic sleep phenotypes. The analyses included 956 middle- to older-aged subjects (40-79 years) from the LIFE Adult Study. The SenseWear Pro 3 Armband was used to collect 11 actigraphic parameters of night- and daytime sleep and three parameters of rest (lying down). The parameters comprised measures of sleep timing, quantity and quality. A total of 7 141 204 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed after imputation and quality control. We identified several variants below the significance threshold of P ≤ 5× 10

27135401	Five endometrial cancer risk loci identified through genome-wide association analysis.	We conducted a meta-analysis of three endometrial cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and two follow-up phases totaling 7,737 endometrial cancer cases and 37,144 controls of European ancestry. Genome-wide imputation and meta-analysis identified five new risk loci of genome-wide significance at likely regulatory regions on chromosomes 13q22.1 (rs11841589, near KLF5), 6q22.31 (rs13328298, in LOC643623 and near HEY2 and NCOA7), 8q24.21 (rs4733613, telomeric to MYC), 15q15.1 (rs937213, in EIF2AK4, near BMF) and 14q32.33 (rs2498796, in AKT1, near SIVA1). We also found a second independent 8q24.21 signal (rs17232730). Functional studies of the 13q22.1 locus showed that rs9600103 (pairwise r(2) = 0.98 with rs11841589) is located in a region of active chromatin that interacts with the KLF5 promoter region. The rs9600103[T] allele that is protective in endometrial cancer suppressed gene expression in vitro, suggesting that regulation of the expression of KLF5, a gene linked to uterine development, is implicated in tumorigenesis. These findings provide enhanced insight into the genetic and biological basis of endometrial cancer.	 10504407 25487306 24119843 25497547 16862161 12111919 22384356 17571346 24096698 23485231 17384015 17179217 20852632 25613900 25560109 21499250 19491896 18428421 17846035 11846609 22064851 24260584 19853286 8781735 23462994 19767754 25248036 18054006 22558003 25378557 24196873 19261849 17572673 23263490 17611704 23535722 20972438 16784338 23082003 23604856 21768358 23535730 26621817 23535732 24530516 23528559 16155052 23715323 19767753 26330482 25225788 10572182 25131200 17554300 17618284 11606070 22955989 20509871 9915566 20634204 18794855 23636398 11971969 17701901 19833720 23269371 24737748 24399786 17483596 20056765 12040186 26574572 23535729 18372901 19590512 21503901 19124504

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in ethnic Chinese people in Taiwan and Hong Kong have shown an association between agranulocytosis induced by antithyroid drugs and the HLA alleles HLA-B*38:02 and HLA-DRB1*08:03. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis in a white European population.	
27142222	Novel genetic risk factors for asthma in African American children: Precision Medicine and the SAGE II Study.	Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airways, is the most common chronic disease of children worldwide. There are significant racial/ethnic disparities in asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality among US children. This trend is mirrored in obesity, which may share genetic and environmental risk factors with asthma. The majority of asthma biomedical research has been performed in populations of European decent. We sought to identify genetic risk factors for asthma in African American children. We also assessed the generalizability of genetic variants associated with asthma in European and Asian populations to African American children. Our study population consisted of 1227 (812 asthma cases, 415 controls) African American children with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between SNP genotype and asthma status. We identified a novel variant in the PTCHD3 gene that is significantly associated with asthma (rs660498, p = 2.2 × 10(-7)) independent of obesity status. Approximately 5 % of previously reported asthma genetic associations identified in European populations replicated in African Americans. Our identification of novel variants associated with asthma in African American children, coupled with our inability to replicate the majority of findings reported in European Americans, underscores the necessity for including diverse populations in biomedical studies of asthma. 	 23992748 25644736 25230631 26672748 22384356 24204385 25301036 25584658 21753830 2060393 22138821 22064851 25534623 26896112 24050698 23532052 24719380 21060320 20954780 24316577 24560518 23750510 21276132 17160007 23392439 23517042 20816195 23408837 24406073 25091437 21718536 26787188 17845591 26871667 25722852 21682736 23705494 20811451 25742612 19996348 22581228 18361712 21439084 24093674 14748924 21804549 26077721 20981092 26226354 17630283 19648217 11686866 12651872 19543373 24039878 21903159 19417063
27142678	Genetic variants in RBFOX3 are associated with sleep latency.	Time to fall asleep (sleep latency) is a major determinant of sleep quality. Chronic, long sleep latency is a major characteristic of sleep-onset insomnia and/or delayed sleep phase syndrome. In this study we aimed to discover common polymorphisms that contribute to the genetics of sleep latency. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 2 572 737 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) established in seven European cohorts including 4242 individuals. We found a cluster of three highly correlated variants (rs9900428, rs9907432 and rs7211029) in the RNA-binding protein fox-1 homolog 3 gene (RBFOX3) associated with sleep latency (P-values=5.77 × 10(-08), 6.59 × 10(-)(08) and 9.17 × 10(-)(08)). These SNPs were replicated in up to 12 independent populations including 30 377 individuals (P-values=1.5 × 10(-)(02), 7.0 × 10(-)(03) and 2.5 × 10(-)(03); combined meta-analysis P-values=5.5 × 10(-07), 5.4 × 10(-07) and 1.0 × 10(-07)). A functional prediction of RBFOX3 based on co-expression with other genes shows that this gene is predominantly expressed in brain (P-value=1.4 × 10(-316)) and the central nervous system (P-value=7.5 × 10(-)(321)). The predicted function of RBFOX3 based on co-expression analysis with other genes shows that this gene is significantly involved in the release cycle of neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric acid and various monoamines (P-values<2.9 × 10(-11)) that are crucial in triggering the onset of sleep. To conclude, in this first large-scale GWAS of sleep latency we report a novel association of variants in RBFOX3 gene. Further, a functional prediction of RBFOX3 supports the involvement of RBFOX3 with sleep latency.	 17503474 16687322 21981805 17363630 16084776 17384015 17284739 19811006 12189488 2267475 6684786 16774159 497315 11808747 18301450 25581432 15830322 19715440 9347613 17572673 21106759 4325303 2420556 19713214 21747913 7247637 16393707 16033648 19633062 17910393 3602285 20233392 17964164 15148587 10397366 9545414 16260614 17554300 10208709 19823630 20509826 17994343 11433032 10963673 17305551 24603971 19617891 17924335 10414349 17053485 9158439 11682282 21605215 19543373 15461793 18060068 9857134 11471052

27149122	Discovery of Genetic Variation on Chromosome 5q22 Associated with Mortality in Heart Failure.	Failure of the human heart to maintain sufficient output of blood for the demands of the body, heart failure, is a common condition with high mortality even with modern therapeutic alternatives. To identify molecular determinants of mortality in patients with new-onset heart failure, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and follow-up genotyping in independent populations. We identified and replicated an association for a genetic variant on chromosome 5q22 with 36% increased risk of death in subjects with heart failure (rs9885413, P = 2.7x10-9). We provide evidence from reporter gene assays, computational predictions and epigenomic marks that this polymorphism increases activity of an enhancer region active in multiple human tissues. The polymorphism was further reproducibly associated with a DNA methylation signature in whole blood (P = 4.5x10-40) that also associated with allergic sensitization and expression in blood of the cytokine TSLP (P = 1.1x10-4). Knockdown of the transcription factor predicted to bind the enhancer region (NHLH1) in a human cell line (HEK293) expressing NHLH1 resulted in lower TSLP expression. In addition, we observed evidence of recent positive selection acting on the risk allele in populations of African descent. Our findings provide novel genetic leads to factors that influence mortality in patients with heart failure.	 19936945 10471456 20400778 20445134 20686566 21070922 10714728 12077327 12111919 11328886 12409541 12457784 13678868 1208363 2883575 2646917 2057034 1669507 8614419 21076409 21131441 22009099 22064851 10023943 25880106 14819398 16255080 16494531 16855265 16855266 16862161 17907809 18288181 18292342 19020324 18974171 19109351 19365001 19307593 19460403 19584346 19622818 20031568 19820058 22343431 22373907 22270071 23140073 22568884 23642322 23715323 23817571 23873083 24258680 24379297 24776769 24657994 24846652 24952745 24126876 25593279 25693563 25685889 20532200
27145994	Common genetic variation in ETV6 is associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer, but much of heritability remains unexplained. To identify additional susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer, here we perform a GWAS in 1,023 cases and 1,306 controls and replicate the findings in seven independent samples from China, comprising 5,317 cases and 6,887 controls. We find a variant at 12p13.2 associated with colorectal cancer risk (rs2238126 in ETV6, P=2.67 × 10(-10)). We replicate this association in an additional 1,046 cases and 1,076 controls of European ancestry (P=0.034). The G allele of rs2238126 confers earlier age at onset of colorectal cancer (P=1.98 × 10(-6)) and reduces the binding affinity of transcriptional enhancer MAX. The mRNA level of ETV6 is significantly lower in colorectal tumours than in paired normal tissues. Our findings highlight the potential importance of genetic variation in ETV6 conferring susceptibility to colorectal cancer.	 11175369 24448986 12184808 12559563 15060146 15510158 16064138 20972440 21179028 21296855 21318373 21242260 16213704 16413481 16908182 17618283 17618284 17694083 17934461 18084292 18372901 18372905 19011631 19302286 19543373 19557189 20220758 20530476 19912441 10891514 11077441 21702039 22182247 22634755 23263487 23266556 23275154 23306950 24309898 24797837 24836286 11054413
27151647	An association study revealed substantial effects of dominance, epistasis and substance dependence co-morbidity on alcohol dependence symptom count.	Alcohol dependence is a complex disease involving polygenes, environment and their interactions. Inadequate consideration of these interactions may have hampered the progress on genome-wide association studies of alcohol dependence. By using the dataset of the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment with 3838 subjects, we conducted a genome-wide association studies of alcohol dependence symptom count (ADSC) with a full genetic model considering additive, dominance, epistasis and their interactions with ethnicity, as well as conditions of co-morbid substance dependence. Twenty quantitative trait single nucleotide polymorphisms (QTSs) showed highly significant associations with ADSC, including four previously reported genes (ADH1C, PKNOX2, CPE and KCNB2) and the reported intergenic rs1363605, supporting the overall validity of the analysis. Two QTSs within or near ADH1C showed very strong association in a dominance inheritance mode and increased the phenotype value of ADSC when the effect of co-morbid opiate or marijuana dependence was controlled. Highly significant association was also identified in variants within four novel genes (RGS6, FMN1, NRM and BPTF), two non-coding RNA and two epistasis loci. QTS rs7616413, located near PTPRG encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, interacted with rs10090742 within ANGPT1 encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase in an additive × additive or dominance × additive manner. The detected QTSs contributed to about 20 percent of total heritability, in which dominance and epistasis effects accounted for over 50 percent. These results demonstrated that perturbations arising from gene-gene interaction and conditions of co-morbidity substantially influence the genetic architecture of complex trait.	
27132594	Identification of Common Genetic Variants Influencing Spontaneous Dizygotic Twinning and Female Fertility.	Spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twinning occurs in 1%-4% of women, with familial clustering and unknown physiological pathways and genetic origin. DZ twinning might index increased fertility and has distinct health implications for mother and child. We performed a GWAS in 1,980 mothers of spontaneous DZ twins and 12,953 control subjects. Findings were replicated in a large Icelandic cohort and tested for association across a broad range of fertility traits in women. Two SNPs were identified (rs11031006 near FSHB, p = 1.54 × 10(-9), and rs17293443 in SMAD3, p = 1.57 × 10(-8)) and replicated (p = 3 × 10(-3) and p = 1.44 × 10(-4), respectively). Based on ∼90,000 births in Iceland, the risk of a mother delivering twins increased by 18% for each copy of allele rs11031006-G and 9% for rs17293443-C. A higher polygenic risk score (PRS) for DZ twinning, calculated based on the results of the DZ twinning GWAS, was significantly associated with DZ twinning in Iceland (p = 0.001). A higher PRS was also associated with having children (p = 0.01), greater lifetime parity (p = 0.03), and earlier age at first child (p = 0.02). Allele rs11031006-G was associated with higher serum FSH levels, earlier age at menarche, earlier age at first child, higher lifetime parity, lower PCOS risk, and earlier age at menopause. Conversely, rs17293443-C was associated with later age at last child. We identified robust genetic risk variants for DZ twinning: one near FSHB and a second within SMAD3, the product of which plays an important role in gonadal responsiveness to FSH. These loci contribute to crucial aspects of reproductive capacity and health. 	 22064851 22267201 22955616 19825856 19896111 19061995 10624730 11253961 11315092 11384650 11479591 12957099 14701940 15380806 3075834 8636367 9121260 9413462 9467561 22958900 23363460 23186620 23298648 23433063 23644456 23527482 23531865 24095971 24304051 24379383 24487276 24979474 25038751 25231187 25231870 25282103 25222633 25807286 25840426 26046917 26239645 26099445 26416764 26430803 26414677 26548314 26014426 16954162 17254420 17194218 17701901 17652186 18024802 18498213 18763692 18824185 19535790 9525398 14198054 15910954 20477721 20378614 20562413 20616382 21397060 21962132 21980404
27153935	Variation at HLA-DPB1 is associated with dermatomyositis in Chinese population.	Dermatomyositis (DM) is a polygenic disorder characterized by inflammation of skeletal muscle and skin. To date, the exact etiopathogenesis of DM remains elusive. To explore the genetic basis of DM, we conducted genome-wide genotyping analysis of 127 patients and 1566 healthy controls by Illumina Human OmniZhongHua-8 BeadChips in the Chinese Han population. We investigated whether the three SNP (rs7750458, rs9501251 and rs9500928) at 6p21.32 in the HLA-DPB1 gene were significantly associated with DM (P < 5 × 10	
27173062	A genome-wide association study of non-HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma identifies prognostic genetic sequence variants in the MAP-kinase and hormone pathways.	Carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx are referred to as head and neck cancers (HNC); together they account for 2-3% of all newly diagnosed cancers in North America. Between 40-50% of HNC are early diagnosed at stages I-II. The 5-year and 10-year relative survival rates are 61% and 50%, respectively. Germline genetic sequence variants (GSV) have become increasingly found to have prognostic implications in a variety of cancers. Identifying these variants may have important clinical and biological implications.

27171184	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Susceptibility Genes Associated with Coronary Artery Aneurysm Formation in Kawasaki Disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) or Kawasaki syndrome is known as a vasculitis of small to medium-sized vessels, and coronary arteries are predominantly involved in childhood. Generally, 20-25% of untreated with IVIG and 3-5% of treated KD patients have been developed coronary artery lesions (CALs), such as dilatation and aneurysm. Understanding how coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) are established and maintained in KD patients is therefore of great importance. Upon our previous genotyping data of 157 valid KD subjects, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been conducted among 11 (7%) CAA-developed KD patients to reveal five significant genetic variants passed pre-defined thresholds and resulted in two novel susceptibility protein-coding genes, which are NEBL (rs16921209 (P = 7.44 × 10(-9); OR = 32.22) and rs7922552 (P = 8.43 × 10(-9); OR = 32.0)) and TUBA3C (rs17076896 (P = 8.04 × 10(-9); OR = 21.03)). Their known functions have been reported to associate with cardiac muscle and tubulin, respectively. As a result, this might imply their putative roles of establishing CAAs during KD progression. Additionally, various model analyses have been utilized to determine dominant and recessive inheritance patterns of identified susceptibility mutations. Finally, all susceptibility genes hit by significant genetic variants were further investigated and the top three representative gene-ontology (GO) clusters were regulation of cell projection organization, neuron recognition, and peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation. Our results help to depict the potential routes of the pathogenesis of CAAs in KD patients and will facilitate researchers to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of KD in personalized medicine.	 24023612 23677057 22017431 23065250 22446961 22633994 22105492 19882345 24577620 24621571 22348488 19949402 18084290 25585854 18025079 26673981 24278430 22392047 24903211 21987091 20618519 23632046 25485088 21533171 22446962 11791654 17033807 21160486 14584002 24652666 15302199 25645453 19604270 23894522 25987543 22361738 21326860 20951326 19132087 21385556 25101798 24261768 22737215 25093412 23456091 22081228 16045726 19438983 11528596 25470559 25122210 1785339 25564534 21430528 12692003 19180512 17701901 9877364 26884859 8752822 25520923 23199405 21221998 21293453 23454411 26679344 25605650 20616737 21789182 19159953 25077179 22359526

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer have identified regions of common genetic variation with lung cancer risk in Europeans who smoke and never-smoking Asian women. This study aimed to conduct a GWAS in African Americans, who have higher rates of lung cancer despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day when compared with Caucasians. This population provides a different genetic architecture based on underlying African ancestry allowing the identification of new regions and exploration of known regions for finer mapping.	 20871597 20700436 22832964 24220910 18783506 12997741 20624154 22539395 23128226 20485328 18596976 19628476 17943122 19859904 20554942 25027329 20445798 18385676 18978787 22241830 23341777 20587604 19029397 20418888 18957677 19641473 19706762 18978790 19010884 24296975 21866343 23143601 18385738 26440539 12492752 15971021 24880342 18385739 21115650 20700438 19706810 22945651 25072098 26239294 10817120 20418889 18163978 15170444 21725308 25529636 18227835 17850611 23232035 21254221 20725741 18519524 19247474 18618000 23221128 22797724 20854418 744822 19654303 19836008 16436765 24733007 21546441
27182965	Detection and interpretation of shared genetic influences on 42 human traits.	We performed a scan for genetic variants associated with multiple phenotypes by comparing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 42 traits or diseases. We identified 341 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) associated with multiple traits. Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 × 10(-12)) and Parkinson disease (log OR = -0.15, P = 1.6 × 10(-7)), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.	 22284131 26287746 26523775 23917628 14976100 2869248 23750121 7739684 21282362 22693459 25490400 25078778 21378990 23140989 25056061 24462370 23637625 21852963 22956599 24204319 23752797 23128233 24830394 17363746 22193673 24270849 2676235 12411947 23375658 18346983 22077970 20686565 11282420 25282103 22139419 22843982 24270615 16513876 21102462 24390342 3344006 18635428 24702953 23453885 25592962 26414676 25631608 24990607 22607825 22504420 23921993 24786325 27225129 9325321 22888763 24721987 23644456 22581228 24162737 25673412 14819896 26284790 25231870 25043022 24983943 23382687 23222517 24646999 20981092 19411597 21167468 7968073 22243964 21062962 25673413 22885922 15075143 18849991 24352232 26053495 25064373
27189021	Multi-ethnic genome-wide association study identifies novel locus for type 2 diabetes susceptibility.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have traditionally been undertaken in homogeneous populations from the same ancestry group. However, with the increasing availability of GWAS in large-scale multi-ethnic cohorts, we have evaluated a framework for detecting association of genetic variants with complex traits, allowing for population structure, and developed a powerful test of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ancestry groups. We have applied the methodology to identify and characterise loci associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) using GWAS data from the Resource for Genetic Epidemiology on Adult Health and Aging, a large multi-ethnic population-based cohort, created for investigating the genetic and environmental basis of age-related diseases. We identified a novel locus for T2D susceptibility at genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)) that maps to TOMM40-APOE, a region previously implicated in lipid metabolism and Alzheimer's disease. We have also confirmed previous reports that single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the TCF7L2 locus demonstrate the greatest extent of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ethnic groups, with the lowest risk observed in populations of East Asian ancestry.	 26034056 16862161 23128226 22125221 22183176 24903779 20085711 17892327 20686565 23555315 20517342 18852200 20811451 18758442 24509480 15052270 17554300 7920638 21653516 24743097 21565264 8346443 25473427 22885922 19543373 21903159
27193031	A combined large-scale meta-analysis identifies COG6 as a novel shared risk locus for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.	During the last years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of common genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the genetic overlap between these two immune-mediated diseases has not been thoroughly examined so far. The aim of the present study was to identify additional risk loci shared between RA and SLE.	
27195708	Investigation of Genetic Variation Underlying Central Obesity amongst South Asians.	South Asians are 1/4 of the world's population and have increased susceptibility to central obesity and related cardiometabolic disease. Knowledge of genetic variants affecting risk of central obesity is largely based on genome-wide association studies of common SNPs in Europeans. To evaluate the contribution of DNA sequence variation to the higher levels of central obesity (defined as waist hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, WHR) among South Asians compared to Europeans we carried out: i) a genome-wide association analysis of >6M genetic variants in 10,318 South Asians with focused analysis of population-specific SNPs; ii) an exome-wide association analysis of ~250K SNPs in protein-coding regions in 2,637 South Asians; iii) a comparison of risk allele frequencies and effect sizes of 48 known WHR SNPs in 12,240 South Asians compared to Europeans. In genome-wide analyses, we found no novel associations between common genetic variants and WHR in South Asians at P<5x10-8; variants showing equivocal association with WHR (P<1x10-5) did not replicate at P<0.05 in an independent cohort of South Asians (N = 1,922) or in published, predominantly European meta-analysis data. In the targeted analyses of 122,391 population-specific SNPs we also found no associations with WHR in South Asians at P<0.05 after multiple testing correction. Exome-wide analyses showed no new associations between genetic variants and WHR in South Asians, either individually at P<1.5x10-6 or grouped by gene locus at P<2.5x10-6. At known WHR loci, risk allele frequencies were not higher in South Asians compared to Europeans (P = 0.77), while effect sizes were unexpectedly smaller in South Asians than Europeans (P<5.0x10-8). Our findings argue against an important contribution for population-specific or cosmopolitan genetic variants underlying the increased risk of central obesity in South Asians compared to Europeans.	 21044979 17395185 16271645 17522677 17209200 24478250 19308071 20921961 23792949 22215131 20944598 17451076 20230652 21899451 16283238 21118952 19557161 7955993 24632736 22322129 1671422 16912131 20739425 16900881 22085868 20019679 17167477 17456532 12690076 19557197 19210179 15367323 20535201 24894727 19815442 12821960 12831085 23754948 20935629 22109280 19763535 18454146 20694148 25115870 18842159 15189364 19005195 22589738 19772691 15454592 25673412 20448537 16326169 17403720 17143606 1511807 9470869 16847701 11126351 15606693 10868967 23656860 22679397 23908385 20644557 24548573 23667432 17363974 15155695
27193062	A genome-wide association scan implicates DCHS2, RUNX2, GLI3, PAX1 and EDAR in human facial variation.	We report a genome-wide association scan for facial features in ∼6,000 Latin Americans. We evaluated 14 traits on an ordinal scale and found significant association (P values<5 × 10(-8)) at single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genomic regions for three nose-related traits: columella inclination (4q31), nose bridge breadth (6p21) and nose wing breadth (7p13 and 20p11). In a subsample of ∼3,000 individuals we obtained quantitative traits related to 9 of the ordinal phenotypes and, also, a measure of nasion position. Quantitative analyses confirmed the ordinal-based associations, identified SNPs in 2q12 associated to chin protrusion, and replicated the reported association of nasion position with SNPs in PAX3. Strongest association in 2q12, 4q31, 6p21 and 7p13 was observed for SNPs in the EDAR, DCHS2, RUNX2 and GLI3 genes, respectively. Associated SNPs in 20p11 extend to PAX1. Consistent with the effect of EDAR on chin protrusion, we documented alterations of mandible length in mice with modified Edar funtion.	 24080012 21388762 24352235 20369248 17194218 22341974 21960693 23028347 22567092 24501696 21694738 16552732 25254375 24646108 17976052 24590292 25656958 26926045 15107406 24339768 8387379 26105758 23565096 23793515 22820512 20448178 26085576 25582401 20616382 24038629 25722852 23851939 20517342 21429143 17486120 15297300 24743097 16140555 26603699 15226309 25226282 25340762 22801491 1650914 18493316 11780064 21541253 10431241 18839484 24070496 23415220 20634204 24651127 17701901 19778523 20979233 22648185 21167468 20570969 19648217 14602680 23217325 25333067 17075844 19166470 26164107 18561327
27195777	Genome-Wide Association Study of Absolute QRS Voltage Identifies Common Variants of TBX3 as Genetic Determinants of Left Ventricular Mass in a Healthy Japanese Population.	Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a common final pathway leading to heart failure. We have searched for genetic determinants of left ventricular (LV) mass using values for absolute electrocardiographic QRS voltage in a healthy Japanese population. After adjusting for covariates, the corrected S and R wave voltages in leads V1 and V5 from 2,994 healthy volunteers in the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database were subjected to a genome-wide association study. Potential associations were validated by an in silico replication study using an independent Japanese population obtained from the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. We identified a novel association between the lead V5, R wave voltage in Japanese individuals and SNP rs7301743[G], which maps near the gene encoding T-box transcription factor Tbx3. Meta-analysis of two independent Japanese datasets demonstrated a marginally significant association of SNP rs7301743 in TBX3|MED13L with a 0.071 mV (95% CI, 0.038-0.11 mV) shorter R wave amplitude in the V5 lead per minor allele copy (P = 7.635 x 10(-8)). The transcriptional repressor, TBX3, is proposed to suppress the development of working ventricular myocardium. Our findings suggest that genetic variation of Tbx3 is associated with LV mass in a healthy Japanese population.	 18276622 25855068 8673105 23434587 21828061 2137733 23136403 18467625 25055868 11352882 19597491 19347680 18107386 19454037 2858114 11772868 10908222 16962130

Given prior evidence of heterogeneity by age at onset in MDD, we tested whether genome-wide significant risk variants for MDD could be identified in cases subdivided by age at onset.	 23245607 20038947 12813115 22031440 21926974 20673876 20167617 21926972 21378990 18272011 19065144 22786799 9841243 21782247 26176920 25187475 16690084 19734902 20616382 21383981 19107115 19200528 23144628 23453885 12063145 25271086 23439482 16538225 20811451 17254424 20516156 23715323 15053853 24581831 22472876 11229992 12860775 20125088 16263848 9596050 19736353 6508504 22554453 16219115 20360315 17701901 21042317 25150007 11007705 19571811 19292899 16935032 22682508 10401442 15564343 19753617
27225129	Genome-wide association study identifies 74 loci associated with educational attainment.	Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20% of the variation across individuals. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.	 4039415 19571811 21407268 22566578 26414676 25288728 25287667 2719624 25642630 25826379 25954001 25597830 23722424
27244555	Genome-wide association study identifies 8p21.3 associated with persistent hepatitis B virus infection among Chinese.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common infectious disease. Here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) among Chinese populations to identify novel genetic loci involved in persistent HBV infection. GWAS scan is performed in 1,251 persistently HBV infected subjects (PIs, cases) and 1,057 spontaneously recovered subjects (SRs, controls), followed by replications in four independent populations totally consisting of 3,905 PIs and 3,356 SRs. We identify a novel locus at 8p21.3 (index rs7000921, odds ratio=0.78, P=3.2 × 10(-12)). Furthermore, we identify significant expression quantitative trait locus associations for INTS10 gene at 8p21.3. We demonstrate that INST10 suppresses HBV replication via IRF3 in liver cells. In clinical plasma samples, we confirm that INST10 levels are significantly decreased in PIs compared with SRs, and negatively correlated with the HBV load. These findings highlight a novel antiviral gene INTS10 at 8p21.3 in the clearance of HBV infection.	 23508906 16862161 21750111 23028341 22345621 20375222 7898524 11981779 22105689 22634754 21721030 23788652 20648603 19715440 25410209 24968874 23926323 9075656 21213104 20512145 19349983 20616382 25802187 23760081 21068253 9528902 11672820 21058334 2764519 22066529 6288579 26231459 20676096 16239144 25557055 21725308 23712092 20554965 20711230 25675981 24452469 25201415 24162738

Thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TO) is an autoimmune-mediated orbital inflammation that can lead to disfigurement and blindness. Multiple genetic loci have been associated with Graves' disease, but the genetic basis for TO is largely unknown. This study aimed to identify loci associated with TO in individuals with Graves' disease, using a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) for the first time to our knowledge in TO.	
27236921	Polymorphism in a lincRNA Associates with a Doubled Risk of Pneumococcal Bacteremia in Kenyan Children.	Bacteremia (bacterial bloodstream infection) is a major cause of illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa but little is known about the role of human genetics in susceptibility. We conducted a genome-wide association study of bacteremia susceptibility in more than 5,000 Kenyan children as part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2). Both the blood-culture-proven bacteremia case subjects and healthy infants as controls were recruited from Kilifi, on the east coast of Kenya. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacteremia in Kilifi and was thus the focus of this study. We identified an association between polymorphisms in a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) gene (AC011288.2) and pneumococcal bacteremia and replicated the results in the same population (p combined = 1.69 × 10(-9); OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.84-3.31). The susceptibility allele is African specific, derived rather than ancestral, and occurs at low frequency (2.7% in control subjects and 6.4% in case subjects). Our further studies showed AC011288.2 expression only in neutrophils, a cell type that is known to play a major role in pneumococcal clearance. Identification of this novel association will further focus research on the role of lincRNAs in human infectious disease. 	 16798756 21890647 3347221 22955988 22138821 22730381 19747721 19915572 26151758 21903251 23907535 20820100 20507892 22955620 23279454 15635111 20517342 22306652 15001782 21706223 23415224 22446964 25533491 21345260 23545301 20694013 23239728 17554300 20509871 17701901 23104008 23717212 11119534 13464827 19543373 19748398 9624306
27262462	Genome-wide association of familial prostate cancer cases identifies evidence for a rare segregating haplotype at 8q24.21.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of prostate cancer risk focused on cases unselected for family history and have reported over 100 significant associations. The International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) has now performed a GWAS of 2511 (unrelated) familial prostate cancer cases and 1382 unaffected controls from 12 member sites. All samples were genotyped on the Illumina 5M+exome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platform. The GWAS identified a significant evidence for association for SNPs in six regions previously associated with prostate cancer in population-based cohorts, including 3q26.2, 6q25.3, 8q24.21, 10q11.23, 11q13.3, and 17q12. Of note, SNP rs138042437 (p = 1.7e(-8)) at 8q24.21 achieved a large estimated effect size in this cohort (odds ratio = 13.3). 116 previously sampled affected relatives of 62 risk-allele carriers from the GWAS cohort were genotyped for this SNP, identifying 78 additional affected carriers in 62 pedigrees. A test for an excess number of affected carriers among relatives exhibited strong evidence for co-segregation of the variant with disease (p = 8.5e(-11)). The majority (92 %) of risk-allele carriers at rs138042437 had a consistent estimated haplotype spanning approximately 100 kb of 8q24.21 that contained the minor alleles of three rare SNPs (dosage minor allele frequencies <1.7 %), rs183373024 (PRNCR1), previously associated SNP rs188140481, and rs138042437 (CASC19). Strong evidence for co-segregation of a SNP on the haplotype further characterizes the haplotype as a prostate cancer predisposition locus.	 21743467 23065704 17401366 26823525 18758462 23128226 20808728 18264096 20718045 21602798 18073375 16682969 22138821 26530130 26254776 25506256 19767754 12474142 18264098 11125122 26015065 23255135 24740360 20644199 26025378 21743057 17299800 18483343 20080505 24026887 25715684 23535732 17401363 22236224 18264097 25939597 17401364 17603485 19188187 16932970 24594601 26589274 23104005 20548291 17701901 25217961 18348202 19767752 20601685 19543373 18708398
27285765	Pooled analysis of genome-wide association studies of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) identifies a new susceptibility locus.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in subjects of European descent have identified associations between cervical cancer risk and three independent loci as well as multiple classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles at 6p21.3. To search for novel loci associated with development of cervical cancer, we performed a pooled analysis of data from two GWASs by imputing over 10 million genetic variants and 424 classical HLA alleles, for 1,553 intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3), 81 cervical cancer and 4,442 controls from the Swedish population. Notable findings were validated in an independent study of 961 patients (827 with CIN3 and 123 with cervical cancer) and 1,725 controls. Our data provided increased support for previously identified loci at 6p21.3 (rs9271898, P = 1.2 × 10-24; rs2516448, 1.1 × 10-15; and rs3130196, 2.3 × 10-9, respectively) and also confirmed associations with reported classical HLA alleles including HLA-B*07:02, -B*15:01, -DRB1*13:01, -DRB1*15:01, -DQA1*01:03, -DQB1*06:03 and -DQB1*06:02. In addition, we identified and subsequently replicated an independent signal at rs73730372 at 6p21.3 (odds ratio = 0.60, 95% confidence interval = 0.54-0.67, P = 3.0 × 10-19), which was found to be an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of both HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1. This is one of the strongest common genetic protective variants identified so far for CIN3. We also found HLA-C*07:02 to be associated with risk of CIN3. The present study provides new insights into pathogenesis of CIN3.	 25220842 24934695 15703836 8098584 16862161 16219398 12445662 23762245 15238505 10363725 23549399 8807499 23670532 23482656 22160393 24335146 23817570 17701901 23269371 24403192 20981092 7801889 19543373 25954001 19901436

27296613	Multiethnic genome-wide association study identifies ethnic-specific associations with body mass index in Hispanics and African Americans.	Genome-wide association studies of obesity have typically assumed fixed genetic effects across ethnicities, rarely attempting to thoroughly compare and contrast findings across various ethnic groups. Therefore, our study aimed to identify novel genetic associations with body mass index (BMI), a common measure of obesity, and explore their cross-ethnic generalizability in a multiethnic population. To that end, we conducted ​ethnic-specific genome-wide association analyses among 1235 Hispanic, 706 Asian, 1549 African American, and 2395 European American subjects from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We compared findings ​across ethnicities and investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive BMI-association p-values among 3379 Hispanic and 6871 African American subjects from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).	 24518834 15181027 17065361 19169219 16862161 12111919 17003360 9492970 16415884 23360386 23551011 19183934 10750037 17470138 12029063 12397006 9519560 12958120 25401691 17510091 23737753 23712987 20811451 12399441 9497171 24570244 21872750 17701901 23104008 18574485 21565264 22243964 25673413 17601994 10587584 17130473 17476472

27386562	Novel multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci implicated in epigenetic regulation.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility in German cohorts with 4888 cases and 10,395 controls. In addition to associations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, 15 non-MHC loci reached genome-wide significance. Four of these loci are novel MS susceptibility loci. They map to the genes L3MBTL3, MAZ, ERG, and SHMT1. The lead variant at SHMT1 was replicated in an independent Sardinian cohort. Products of the genes L3MBTL3, MAZ, and ERG play important roles in immune cell regulation. SHMT1 encodes a serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of a carbon unit to the folate cycle. This reaction is required for regulation of methylation homeostasis, which is important for establishment and maintenance of epigenetic signatures. Our GWAS approach in a defined population with limited genetic substructure detected associations not found in larger, more heterogeneous cohorts, thus providing new clues regarding MS pathogenesis.	 19482860 22954662 22736161 26426330 22955619 21833088 26673150 24278027 11986237 20453840 23593011 20167617 16490960 26366554 9583687 25734800 25954002 23731539 16032513 25599564 24336351 16032514 22820512 18349090 12177636 15889154 16954520 21565292 26343388 24852507 24270187 19128210 24478339 25722852 22332098 19773445 19107115 24493701 18500345 16632515 17003564 9529126 15052270 23822983 23332363 25713100 24076602 18467348 21521612 26438306 23915189 20634204 11791185 19020309 23269371 1502157 23712092 23203885 26062845 26475045 22568884 26050039 12169536 17586828 20428171 9558398 25363779 19543373 19583771 22955990 23630272 22190364 18946483 25707369
27322543	Meta-analysis of 375,000 individuals identifies 38 susceptibility loci for migraine.	Migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder affecting around one in seven people worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. There is some debate about whether migraine is a disease of vascular dysfunction or a result of neuronal dysfunction with secondary vascular changes. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have thus far identified 13 independent loci associated with migraine. To identify new susceptibility loci, we carried out a genetic study of migraine on 59,674 affected subjects and 316,078 controls from 22 GWA studies. We identified 44 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with migraine risk (P < 5 × 10(-8)) that mapped to 38 distinct genomic loci, including 28 loci not previously reported and a locus that to our knowledge is the first to be identified on chromosome X. In subsequent computational analyses, the identified loci showed enrichment for genes expressed in vascular and smooth muscle tissues, consistent with a predominant theory of migraine that highlights vascular etiologies.	 23245607 22751097 25496898 21104887 23872634 20080989 21454812 21085122 12539047 8816834 23128226 25985137 25597830 25420145 11294880 22138821 25056061 25642630 22683712 25064009 21654699 20944595 18789357 25581432 19539239 25934857 22820512 21946350 17218491 25124494 21565292 8898206 22955616 25282103 21924589 12728266 20369019 19198609 7908596 22144573 10724174 11287655 20811451 16932562 21521208 23715323 24949311 10869500 22745674 23793025 24810048 17085540 23771276 27066539 23768516 21058334 25659123 24162737 16617138 24728292 25338720 24852292 20835244 24762786 17924348 16885183 24670762 23868073 23408906 23596210 17701901 21666692 21407268 23104008 14997420 17907811 21378988 22055160 21339752 26063472 20385826 23456878 22955828 16054936 18676988 25363779 16239344 20802479 23671251 12427653
27329760	Genome-wide association study of 40,000 individuals identifies two novel loci associated with bipolar disorder.	Bipolar disorder (BD) is a genetically complex mental illness characterized by severe oscillations of mood and behaviour. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk loci that together account for a small portion of the heritability. To identify additional risk loci, we performed a two-stage meta-analysis of >9 million genetic variants in 9,784 bipolar disorder patients and 30,471 controls, the largest GWAS of BD to date. In this study, to increase power we used ∼2,000 lithium-treated cases with a long-term diagnosis of BD from the Consortium on Lithium Genetics, excess controls, and analytic methods optimized for markers on the X-chromosome. In addition to four known loci, results revealed genome-wide significant associations at two novel loci: an intergenic region on 9p21.3 (rs12553324, P =  5.87 × 10 	 9921965 1801199 17440436 18974171 24146854 26432245 16862161 23974872 5304735 21926972 23643377 17692389 23212456 18466881 12499305 24991953 23070075 23105939 22820512 17549761 24705630 18711365 12742871 21818774 18191109 20616382 8915891 21376301 23663952 25849665 22694957 16464232 18852200 11723175 19339916 22182935 24308489 15568195 25043884 24618891 26806518 10655525 20453537 17485606 25532077 17701901 23269371 16940976 22426310 16138915 21383262 21167468 21674006 10449789 24280982 17486107 19543373 18441336 25954001
27327535	A genome-wide association study in Caucasian women suggests the involvement of HLA genes in the severity of facial solar lentigines.	Solar lentigines are a common feature of sun-induced skin ageing. Little is known, however, about the genetic factors contributing to their development. In this genome-wide association study, we aimed to identify genetic loci associated with solar lentigines on the face in 502 middle-aged French women. Nine SNPs, gathered in two independent blocks on chromosome 6, exhibited a false discovery rate below 25% when looking for associations with the facial lentigine score. The first block, in the 6p22 region, corresponded to intergenic SNPs and also exhibited a significant association with forehead lentigines (P = 1.37 × 10(-8) ). The second block, within the 6p21 HLA region, was associated with decreased HLA-C expression according to several eQTL databases. Interestingly, these SNPs were also in high linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-C*0701 allele (r(2)  = 0.95). We replicated an association recently found by GWAS in the IRF4 gene. Finally, a complementary study on 44 selected candidate SNPs revealed novel associations in the MITF gene. Overall, our results point to several mechanisms involved in the severity of facial lentigines, including HLA/immunity and the melanogenesis pathway.	
27325353	GWAS analysis of handgrip and lower body strength in older adults in the CHARGE consortium.	Decline in muscle strength with aging is an important predictor of health trajectory in the elderly. Several factors, including genetics, are proposed contributors to variability in muscle strength. To identify genetic contributors to muscle strength, a meta-analysis of genomewide association studies of handgrip was conducted. Grip strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer in 27 581 individuals of European descent over 65 years of age from 14 cohort studies. Genomewide association analysis was conducted on ~2.7 million imputed and genotyped variants (SNPs). Replication of the most significant findings was conducted using data from 6393 individuals from three cohorts. GWAS of lower body strength was also characterized in a subset of cohorts. Two genomewide significant (P-value< 5 × 10(-8) ) and 39 suggestive (P-value< 5 × 10(-5) ) associations were observed from meta-analysis of the discovery cohorts. After meta-analysis with replication cohorts, genomewide significant association was observed for rs752045 on chromosome 8 (β = 0.47, SE = 0.08, P-value = 5.20 × 10(-10) ). This SNP is mapped to an intergenic region and is located within an accessible chromatin region (DNase hypersensitivity site) in skeletal muscle myotubes differentiated from the human skeletal muscle myoblasts cell line. This locus alters a binding motif of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (CEBPB) that is implicated in muscle repair mechanisms. GWAS of lower body strength did not yield significant results. A common genetic variant in a chromosomal region that regulates myotube differentiation and muscle repair may contribute to variability in grip strength in the elderly. Further studies are needed to uncover the mechanisms that link this genetic variant with muscle strength.	 17105797 18974171 22902781 21526222 22987697 24737560 16862161 24306210 12959964 22064851 23938060 17431088 24973796 22690667 10022113 16696750 20844262 23775115 20616382 22152057 11009425 21054287 20813793 25157231 22955023 15031308 21975090 19805133 22373907 22743239 24462499 15209650
27354352	Genome-wide association study in East Asians identifies two novel breast cancer susceptibility loci.	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide. Genetic factors have been shown to play an important role in breast cancer aetiology. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 14 224 cases and 14 829 controls of East Asian women to search for novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two loci were found to be associated with breast cancer risk at the genome-wide significance level. The first locus, represented by rs12118297 at 1p22.3 (near the LMO4 gene), was associated with breast cancer risk with odds ratio (OR) and (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 0.91 (0.88-0.94) and a P-value of 4.48 × 10	 19219042 19789366 25038754 26432245 21263130 16862161 22865192 19330027 18438407 11751867 17529967 20484103 22976474 16236996 19906825 22138821 23544013 22685416 26426411 22064851 19031103 22951594 25802202 23374354 21873240 21908515 21497495 23096997 22785202 22267197 10861490 19330030 22955616 22257669 17529974 19648968 16682732 20616382 15657102 17529973 25327703 22523482 22452962 22383897 20504332 24143190 20699374 20502693 19996398 23677579 25456131 20852631 22723967 23535733 22539603 20542480 23535825 23593120 24967588 25338720 22522925 24943594 23000897 20220758 20585626 22955989 20453838 23505254 23353824 23715497 17293864 24325915 12718640 19396169 14973555 23535729 22373907 22923054 25751625 22492648 22037553 21514219 25954001 23411593
27362418	A Powerful Procedure for Pathway-Based Meta-analysis Using Summary Statistics Identifies 43 Pathways Associated with Type II Diabetes in European Populations.	Meta-analysis of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has become an effective approach for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with complex traits. However, it is difficult to integrate the readily accessible SNP-level summary statistics from a meta-analysis into more powerful multi-marker testing procedures, which generally require individual-level genetic data. We developed a general procedure called Summary based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (sARTP) for conducting gene and pathway meta-analysis that uses only SNP-level summary statistics in combination with genotype correlation estimated from a panel of individual-level genetic data. We demonstrated the validity and power advantage of sARTP through empirical and simulated data. We conducted a comprehensive pathway-based meta-analysis with sARTP on type 2 diabetes (T2D) by integrating SNP-level summary statistics from two large studies consisting of 19,809 T2D cases and 111,181 controls with European ancestry. Among 4,713 candidate pathways from which genes in neighborhoods of 170 GWAS established T2D loci were excluded, we detected 43 T2D globally significant pathways (with Bonferroni corrected p-values < 0.05), which included the insulin signaling pathway and T2D pathway defined by KEGG, as well as the pathways defined according to specific gene expression patterns on pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma. Using summary data from 8 eastern Asian T2D GWAS with 6,952 cases and 11,865 controls, we showed 7 out of the 43 pathways identified in European populations remained to be significant in eastern Asians at the false discovery rate of 0.1. We created an R package and a web-based tool for sARTP with the capability to analyze pathways with thousands of genes and tens of thousands of SNPs.	 26808494 25555821 21085203 23128226 17303618 25642630 26656570 20560208 19074959 24316577 25599223 23891470 17033957 24794927 19333968 24022295 17236140 25469308 25518859 20935630 20517342 22158537 24199751 15735714 20598278 24509480 19723656 22859961 24884617 20053841 26119817 19812666 25371288 26818947 22426310 26258848 20981092 21565264 25170024 20714348 20560206 22885922 22958900 21903159 11855950 15645388

27363682	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for multiple myeloma.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy with a significant heritable basis. Genome-wide association studies have transformed our understanding of MM predisposition, but individual studies have had limited power to discover risk loci. Here we perform a meta-analysis of these GWAS, add a new GWAS and perform replication analyses resulting in 9,866 cases and 239,188 controls. We confirm all nine known risk loci and discover eight new loci at 6p22.3 (rs34229995, P=1.31 × 10(-8)), 6q21 (rs9372120, P=9.09 × 10(-15)), 7q36.1 (rs7781265, P=9.71 × 10(-9)), 8q24.21 (rs1948915, P=4.20 × 10(-11)), 9p21.3 (rs2811710, P=1.72 × 10(-13)), 10p12.1 (rs2790457, P=1.77 × 10(-8)), 16q23.1 (rs7193541, P=5.00 × 10(-12)) and 20q13.13 (rs6066835, P=1.36 × 10(-13)), which localize in or near to JARID2, ATG5, SMARCD3, CCAT1, CDKN2A, WAC, RFWD3 and PREX1. These findings provide additional support for a polygenic model of MM and insight into the biological basis of tumour development.	 23756893 23955597 25904160 24119843 22717455 17895893 17194218 25497547 22941192 12111919 24811790 21037568 20414203 26743840 22058209 12845480 20453839 18715499 25237182 17545613 23666239 25807286 23933736 21552263 22064851 20453196 24662484 15965027 24670763 17572673 19684571 21430775 24943595 20616218 25840597 26007630 26551672 20062064 20354512 23354484 22120009 19038762 16826223 25695508 23502783 23995858 20173098 26912360 22955989 24487276 26367794 20418889 25208325 19680443 16228001 26368830 26208354 23193196 25261932 20981092 23281567 21167468 24629228 26121088 22343431 24247655 19543373 25645357 20220069 24013639
27397699	Genome-wide association meta-analyses identified 1q43 and 2q32.2 for hip Ward's triangle areal bone mineral density.	Aiming to identify genomic variants associated with osteoporosis, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) at Ward's triangle of the hip in 7175 subjects from 6 samples. We performed in silico replications with femoral neck, trochanter, and inter-trochanter BMDs in 6912 subjects from the Framingham heart study (FHS), and with forearm, femoral neck and lumbar spine BMDs in 32965 subjects from the GEFOS summary results. Combining the evidence from all samples, we identified 2 novel loci for areal BMD: 1q43 (rs1414660, discovery p=1.20×10(-8), FHS p=0.05 for trochanter BMD; rs9287237, discovery p=3.55×10(-7), FHS p=9.20×10(-3) for trochanter BMD, GEFOS p=0.02 for forearm BMD, nearest gene FMN2) and 2q32.2 (rs56346965, discovery p=7.48×10(-7), FHS p=0.10 for inter-trochanter BMD, GEFOS p=0.02 for spine BMD, nearest gene NAB1). The two lead SNPs rs1414660 and rs56346965 are eQTL sites for the genes GREM2 and NAB1 respectively. Functional annotation of GREM2 and NAB1 illustrated their involvement in BMP signaling pathway and in bone development. We also replicated three previously reported loci: 5q14.3 (rs10037512, discovery p=3.09×10(-6), FHS p=8.50×10(-3), GEFOS p=1.23×10(-24) for femoral neck BMD, nearest gene MEF2C), 6q25.1 (rs3020340, discovery p=1.64×10(-6), GEFOS p=1.69×10(-3) for SPN-BMD, nearest gene ESR1) and 7q21.3 (rs13310130, discovery p=8.79×10(-7), GEFOS p=2.61×10(-7) for spine BMD, nearest gene SHFM1). Our findings provide additional insights that further enhance our understanding of bone development, osteoporosis, and fracture pathogenesis.	 23572186 11315092 25693563 16862161 22644325 27072516 22560090 23128226 20164292 9492970 24037378 22064851 25352553 15965027 19073177 12049882 11796223 24249740 10556075 7624335 22955616 12050122 12958120 20616382 24931982 19478016 9639362 16455317 10208746 19801982 24084292 22504420 21533022 21058334 20072603 22161640 18445777 26367794 19249006 19222302 18992858 15039429 17701901 22031546 24618466 15251747 18198176 18455228 25954001 19702646
27399966	Genome-wide association meta-analysis in Chinese and European individuals identifies ten new loci associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OMIM 152700) is a genetically complex autoimmune disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 50 loci as robustly associated with the disease in single ancestries, but genome-wide transancestral studies have not been conducted. We combined three GWAS data sets from Chinese (1,659 cases and 3,398 controls) and European (4,036 cases and 6,959 controls) populations. A meta-analysis of these studies showed that over half of the published SLE genetic associations are present in both populations. A replication study in Chinese (3,043 cases and 5,074 controls) and European (2,643 cases and 9,032 controls) subjects found ten previously unreported SLE loci. Our study provides further evidence that the majority of genetic risk polymorphisms for SLE are contained within the same regions across both populations. Furthermore, a comparison of risk allele frequencies and genetic risk scores suggested that the increased prevalence of SLE in non-Europeans (including Asians) has a genetic basis.	 25604658 18204098 16761508 23273568 20738864 21829393 22233601 20944595 24070858 3430520 14645227 21336280 23543754 20169177 21217833 15085197 26551672 20616382 25500883 24532676 20517342 26414676 22110124 22446964 23874208 24509480 21880982 20369022 24076602 19838193 23535865 20634204 24586183 23104008 26502338 24743097 21167468 21397060 22958900 21134959 25890262 21044949 24786080
27402877	Identification of genetic modifiers of age-at-onset for familial Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of neurodegenerative movement disorder and the second most common cause of dementia. Genes are thought to have a stronger effect on age-at-onset of PD than on risk, yet there has been a phenomenal success in identifying risk loci but not age-at-onset modifiers. We conducted a genome-wide study for age-at-onset. We analysed familial and non-familial PD separately, per prior evidence for strong genetic effect on age-at-onset in familial PD. GWAS was conducted in 431 unrelated PD individuals with at least one affected relative (familial PD) and 1544 non-familial PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC); an additional 737 familial PD and 2363 non-familial PD were used for replication.

27412012	A genome-wide association meta-analysis on apolipoprotein A-IV concentrations.	Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is a major component of HDL and chylomicron particles and is involved in reverse cholesterol transport. It is an early marker of impaired renal function. We aimed to identify genetic loci associated with apoA-IV concentrations and to investigate relationships with known susceptibility loci for kidney function and lipids. A genome-wide association meta-analysis on apoA-IV concentrations was conducted in five population-based cohorts (n = 13,813) followed by two additional replication studies (n = 2,267) including approximately 10 M SNPs. Three independent SNPs from two genomic regions were significantly associated with apoA-IV concentrations: rs1729407 near APOA4 (P = 6.77 × 10 	 15042513 21945496 22125224 18263651 24097068 26037138 8688083 9109435 11780313 17541022 20609189 24097064 7579063 21378990 25591862 20031538 23846131 2668442 3919133 7980697 23315928 115688 20864672 19057464 22820512 17572673 21217833 19592705 21565292 20686565 11805176 26831199 22772592 19661213 8013892 25561047 16382017 10613636 6442339 8651220 11956236 12417525 19641709 25942577 16788210 24816252 16443770 26345861 25640749 21058334 12676816 24762786 4762550 10484534 20634204 21886157 19561590 20117098 19734154 3089295 21167468 25431330 21397060 26969407 12121350 18366642 22958900 23906492 2159462 24262325 10987595 23381795 7964193 16929032
27400856	Genome-wide common and rare variant analysis provides novel insights into clozapine-associated neutropenia.	The antipsychotic clozapine is uniquely effective in the management of schizophrenia; however, its use is limited by its potential to induce agranulocytosis. The causes of this, and of its precursor neutropenia, are largely unknown, although genetic factors have an important role. We sought risk alleles for clozapine-associated neutropenia in a sample of 66 cases and 5583 clozapine-treated controls, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), imputed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, exome array and copy-number variation (CNV) analyses. We then combined associated variants in a meta-analysis with data from the Clozapine-Induced Agranulocytosis Consortium (up to 163 cases and 7970 controls). In the largest combined sample to date, we identified a novel association with rs149104283 (odds ratio (OR)=4.32, P=1.79 × 10	 21311410 21212528 22153075 20190787 3046553 16862161 8894200 18923646 7694912 17012270 25056061 23762245 23070075 16844094 7620171 25521334 23752246 18650507 24918167 20616382 24759409 20868635 18554923 7945743 10860943 21850710 23338132 17924348 25732907 9676893 10779507 17701901 18294295 21995462 11266078 19058842 25187353 23209086 22863193 19543373 24311552 26740555
27412988	From Genotype to Phenotype: Nonsense Variants in SLC13A1 Are Associated with Decreased Serum Sulfate and Increased Serum Aminotransferases.	Using genomic applications to glean insights into human biology, we systematically searched for nonsense single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are rare in the general population but enriched in the Old Order Amish (Amish) due to founder effect. We identified two nonlinked, nonsense SNVs (R12X and W48X) in SLC13A1 (allele frequencies 0.29% and 0.74% in the Amish; enriched 1.2-fold and 3.7-fold, compared to the outbred Caucasian population, respectively). SLC13A1 encodes the apical sodium-sulfate cotransporter (NaS1) responsible for sulfate (re)absorption in the kidneys and intestine. SLC13A1 R12X and W48X were independently associated with a 27.6% (P = 2.7 × 10(-8)) and 27.3% (P = 6.9 × 10(-14)) decrease in serum sulfate, respectively (P = 8.8 × 10(-20) for carriers of either SLC13A1 nonsense SNV). We further performed the first exome- and genome-wide association study (ExWAS/GWAS) of serum sulfate and identified a missense variant (L348P) in SLC26A1, which encodes the basolateral sulfate-anion transporter (Sat1), that was associated with decreased serum sulfate (P = 4.4 × 10(-12)). Consistent with sulfate's role in xenobiotic detoxification and protection against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, SLC13A1 nonsense SNV carriers had higher aminotransferase levels compared to noncarriers. Furthermore, SLC26A1 L348P was associated with lower whole-body bone mineral density (BMD) and higher serum calcium, consistent with the osteochondrodysplasia exhibited by dogs and sheep with naturally occurring, homozygous, loss-of-function mutations in Slc13a1 This study demonstrates the power and translational potential of systematic identification and characterization of rare, loss-of-function variants and warrants additional studies to better understand the importance of sulfate in human physiology, disease, and drug toxicity.	 15684121 20160351 19474428 19706858 13886865 23722153 23104138 8571951 9714015 16939402 16729303 26374108 21298488 9194521 10834415 21490138 22742499 15720248 17261661 20433770 21419855 10482955 23300579 21532726 15621217 10435209 24250268 8346704 9410896 18440328 24193406 2325885 12888984 11503162 22311966
27416945	Genome-Wide Association Study of the Modified Stumvoll Insulin Sensitivity Index Identifies BCL2 and FAM19A2 as Novel Insulin Sensitivity Loci.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found few common variants that influence fasting measures of insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that a GWAS of an integrated assessment of fasting and dynamic measures of insulin sensitivity would detect novel common variants. We performed a GWAS of the modified Stumvoll Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI) within the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium. Discovery for genetic association was performed in 16,753 individuals, and replication was attempted for the 23 most significant novel loci in 13,354 independent individuals. Association with ISI was tested in models adjusted for age, sex, and BMI and in a model analyzing the combined influence of the genotype effect adjusted for BMI and the interaction effect between the genotype and BMI on ISI (model 3). In model 3, three variants reached genome-wide significance: rs13422522 (NYAP2; P = 8.87 × 10(-11)), rs12454712 (BCL2; P = 2.7 × 10(-8)), and rs10506418 (FAM19A2; P = 1.9 × 10(-8)). The association at NYAP2 was eliminated by conditioning on the known IRS1 insulin sensitivity locus; the BCL2 and FAM19A2 associations were independent of known cardiometabolic loci. In conclusion, we identified two novel loci and replicated known variants associated with insulin sensitivity. Further studies are needed to clarify the causal variant and function at the BCL2 and FAM19A2 loci.	 26639348 23151437 12637977 15126243 22933114 11315860 22325160 10868854 9166672 1541672 12882937 19223598 17956454 9545414 22581228 22885924 25673412 24296717 22426310 21181894 25798622 24891021 22885922 20185807 19822411
27418160	Shared Genetic Risk Factors of Intracranial, Abdominal, and Thoracic Aneurysms.	Intracranial aneurysms (IAs), abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) all have a familial predisposition. Given that aneurysm types are known to co-occur, we hypothesized that there may be shared genetic risk factors for IAs, AAAs, and TAAs.	 11315092 18160059 25475588 22384356 20446064 23128226 22138821 25642630 24046328 12499305 17568781 19501022 23535823 22106312 24258680 23993240 20622881 24497844 15866312 20364137 23202125 8653370 26414676 18852200 20571364 25566314 26979079 16251536 18948608 20124136 3673680 18176561 21815248 15792503 18997786 18794855 17701901 17273890 17182954 22055160 19571811 21909107 25256182 24120708 20847318
27424934	Genome-wide association study in East Asians suggests UHMK1 as a novel bone mineral density susceptibility gene.	To identify genetic variants that influence bone mineral density (BMD) in East Asians, we performed a quantitative trait analysis of lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD in a Korean population-based cohort (N=2729) and follow-up replication analysis in a Chinese Han population and two Caucasian populations (N=1547, 2250 and 987, respectively). From the meta-analysis of the stage 1 discovery analysis and stage 2 replication analysis, we identified four BMD loci that reached near-genome-wide significance level (P<5×10(-7)). One locus on 1q23 (UHMK1, rs16863247, P=4.1×10(-7) for femoral neck BMD and P=3.2×10(-6) for total hip BMD) was a novel BMD signal. Interestingly, rs16863247 was very rare in Caucasians (minor allele frequency<0.01), indicating that this association could be specific to East Asians. In gender specific analysis, rs1160574 on 1q32 (KCNH1) was associated with femoral neck BMD (P=2.1×10(-7)) in female subjects. rs9371538 in the known BMD region on 6q25 ESR1 was associated with lumbar spine BMD (P=5.6×10(-9)). rs7776725 in the known BMD region on 7q31 WTN16 was associated with total hip BMD (P=8.6×10(-9)). In osteoblasts, endogenous UHMK1 expression was increased during differentiation and UHMK1 knockdown decreased its differentiation, while UHMK1 overexpression increased its differentiation. In osteoclasts, endogenous UHMK1 expression was decreased during differentiation and UHMK1 knockdown increased its differentiation, while UHMK1 overexpression decreased its differentiation. In conclusion, our genome-wide association study identified the UHMK1 gene as a novel BMD locus specific to East Asians. Functional studies suggest a role of UHMK1 on regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.	
27424798	Genome-wide association study identifies novel susceptibility loci for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.	Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma represents the second most common cutaneous malignancy, affecting 7-11% of Caucasians in the United States. The genetic determinants of susceptibility to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma remain largely unknown. Here we report the results of a two-stage genome-wide association study of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, totalling 7,404 cases and 292,076 controls. Eleven loci reached genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)) including seven previously confirmed pigmentation-related loci: MC1R, ASIP, TYR, SLC45A2, OCA2, IRF4 and BNC2. We identify an additional four susceptibility loci: 11q23.3 CADM1, a metastasis suppressor gene involved in modifying tumour interaction with cell-mediated immunity; 2p22.3; 7p21.1 AHR, the dioxin receptor involved in anti-apoptotic pathways and melanoma progression; and 9q34.3 SEC16A, a putative oncogene with roles in secretion and cellular proliferation. These susceptibility loci provide deeper insight into the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma.	 23136087 18974171 21526222 11179997 16862161 17952075 18596976 26219541 22064851 18563784 23912710 20585627 26237428 18451182 16128739 22509285 26686553 22690667 18462017 22955616 25569158 19578363 25705849 19710684 23812766 18726896 26835600 23375456 25428226 24267888 25338720 25760557 17924348 25526736 25724930 18488027 24916375 19384953 12145550 23817569 23711559 23843039 20981092 25956157 21441907 22955990 26829030 25954001
27436580	An extended genome-wide association study identifies novel susceptibility loci for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	To further identify novel susceptibility loci of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we here extended our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) by boosting statistical power with larger sample size and validating more SNPs in the ranking list based on the GWAS P-values. The discovery stage consisting of 463,250 SNPs in 1,583 cases and 2,979 controls of southern Chinese ancestry revealed 1,257 top SNPs to be associated with NPC, which were brought forward for validation in 1,925 cases and 1,947 controls of southern Chinese. Further, 11 SNPs were selected for another independent validation in 3,538 cases and 3,644 controls of southern Chinese. The joint analysis with 7,046 cases and 8,570 controls resulted in two associations surpassing genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10	
27515689	Meta-analysis of Genome Wide Association Studies Identifies Genetic Markers of Late Toxicity Following Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.	Nearly 50% of cancer patients undergo radiotherapy. Late radiotherapy toxicity affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients. We aimed to meta-analyze individual level data from four genome-wide association studies from prostate cancer radiotherapy cohorts including 1564 men to identify genetic markers of toxicity. Prospectively assessed two-year toxicity endpoints (urinary frequency, decreased urine stream, rectal bleeding, overall toxicity) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were tested using multivariable regression, adjusting for clinical and patient-related risk factors. A fixed-effects meta-analysis identified two SNPs: rs17599026 on 5q31.2 with urinary frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-4.69, p-value 4.16×10(-8)) and rs7720298 on 5p15.2 with decreased urine stream (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p-value=3.21×10(-8)). These SNPs lie within genes that are expressed in tissues adversely affected by pelvic radiotherapy including bladder, kidney, rectum and small intestine. The results show that heterogeneous radiotherapy cohorts can be combined to identify new moderate-penetrance genetic variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity. The work provides a basis for larger collaborative efforts to identify enough variants for a future test involving polygenic risk profiling. 	 20171505 14596489 23021708 24119843 22385796 26166774 23993398 16751059 21937138 27140283 15062159 23128226 25613900 21605943 19836155 12499305 22169269 19410201 23363497 25473424 16242258 22767148 7721619 16969982 17572673 22169268 23719583 17938396 22955616 18398418 20932654 16415888 24974847 19184668 23376709 11838719 21934053 21861849 15297300 23715323 24785509 19148183 20074824 23657481 19339519 1196376 11777639 20171506 23022171 18354103 15519779 23374503 16814954 19543373 14685227 23597419 15297138 20171515
27439200	Combining genomewide association study and lung eQTL analysis provides evidence for novel genes associated with asthma.	Genomewide association studies (GWASs) of asthma have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that modestly increase the risk for asthma. This could be due to phenotypic heterogeneity of asthma. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is a phenotypic hallmark of asthma. We aim to identify susceptibility genes for asthma combined with BHR and analyse the presence of cis-eQTLs among replicated SNPs. Secondly, we compare the genetic association of SNPs previously associated with (doctor's diagnosed) asthma to our GWAS of asthma with BHR.	 22507743 21696813 16862161 21814517 20372189 22561531 21397937 22188591 25352553 10836314 9105061 20032318 20833654 18417506 12867607 19729670 10491451 22694930 16989922 23541324 20369019 23209423 20860503 22921872 9641595 19426955 24241537 21540309 21804548 19797761 21907864 23181788 22015542 23666637 21150878 17701901 23817569 20159242 21804549 22373407 15316504 24056518 23945176

Drug abuse is a common and heritable set of disorders, but the underlying genetic factors are largely unknown. We conducted genome-wide association studies of drug abuse using 7 million imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions in African Americans (AAs; n = 3742) and European Americans (EAs; n = 6845). Cases were drawn from the Urban Health Study of street-recruited people, who injected drugs and reported abusing opioids, cocaine, marijuana, stimulants and/or other drugs 10 or more times in the past 30 days, and were compared with population controls. Independent replication testing was conducted in 755 AAs and 1131 EAs from the Genetic Association Information Network.

27455349	A thrifty variant in CREBRF strongly influences body mass index in Samoans.	Samoans are a unique founder population with a high prevalence of obesity, making them well suited for identifying new genetic contributors to obesity. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 3,072 Samoans, discovered a variant, rs12513649, strongly associated with body mass index (BMI) (P = 5.3 × 10(-14)), and replicated the association in 2,102 additional Samoans (P = 1.2 × 10(-9)). Targeted sequencing identified a strongly associated missense variant, rs373863828 (p.Arg457Gln), in CREBRF (meta P = 1.4 × 10(-20)). Although this variant is extremely rare in other populations, it is common in Samoans (frequency of 0.259), with an effect size much larger than that of any other known common BMI risk variant (1.36-1.45 kg/m(2) per copy of the risk-associated allele). In comparison to wild-type CREBRF, the Arg457Gln variant when overexpressed selectively decreased energy use and increased fat storage in an adipocyte cell model. These data, in combination with evidence of positive selection of the allele encoding p.Arg457Gln, support a 'thrifty' variant hypothesis as a factor in human obesity.	 25920570 10629058 25206364 10797032 22996348 17658951 17384015 20718045 24247219 24799123 22138821 25942621 24554778 16537646 12529412 16378333 19020537 19094235 17572673 25428361 25357204 11867360 26383935 22402612 11782049 20616382 20935630 24931982 25015648 25439724 24200885 20517342 18208337 16494531 15588493 27535533 2198152 20233392 15894616 22187472 24209692 25653097 13937884 20634204 17701901 26130488 23269371 24094745 19238140 24743097 23071095 942051 25412305 17924335 10578208 25673413 21728997 12397357 19543373 2031491 3899825

Through imputation and mixed-model association analysis in 12,577 cases and 23,475 controls, combined with 2,579 cases and 2,767 controls in an independent replication cohort, we fine-mapped a new risk locus on chromosome 21 and identified C21orf2 as a gene associated with ALS risk. In addition, we identified MOBP and SCFD1 as new associated risk loci. We established evidence of ALS being a complex genetic trait with a polygenic architecture. Furthermore, we estimated the SNP-based heritability at 8.5%, with a distinct and important role for low-frequency variants (frequency 1-10%). This study motivates the interrogation of larger samples with full genome coverage to identify rare causal variants that underpin ALS risk.	 24473328 22384356 20801718 23128226 24994843 25597830 20801717 24974849 21767396 25642630 21289087 20861059 19734901 22344220 22498053 21944778 24256812 9325172 20369019 26290490 16415888 25803835 23774735 21989247 17219036 21685912 21944779 25653097 22051914 25174004 26059317 25700176
27339598	A new 3p25 locus is associated with liver fibrosis progression in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients.	There is growing evidence that human genetic variants contribute to liver fibrosis in subjects with hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfection, but this aspect has been little investigated in patients coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We performed the first genome-wide association study of liver fibrosis progression in patients coinfected with HCV and HIV, using the well-characterized French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. Liver fibrosis was assessed by elastography (FibroScan), providing a quantitative fibrosis score. After quality control, a genome-wide association study was conducted on 289 Caucasian patients, for a total of 8,426,597 genotyped (Illumina Omni2.5 BeadChip) or reliably imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms with P values <10	
27579533	Three new pancreatic cancer susceptibility signals identified on chromosomes 1q32.1, 5p15.33 and 8q24.21.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common pancreatic cancer susceptibility variants at 13 chromosomal loci in individuals of European descent. To identify new susceptibility variants, we performed imputation based on 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project data and association analysis using 5,107 case and 8,845 control subjects from 27 cohort and case-control studies that participated in the PanScan I-III GWAS. This analysis, in combination with a two-staged replication in an additional 6,076 case and 7,555 control subjects from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control (PanC4) Consortia uncovered 3 new pancreatic cancer risk signals marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2816938 at chromosome 1q32.1 (per allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 4.88x10 -15), rs10094872 at 8q24.21 (OR = 1.15, P = 3.22x10 -9) and rs35226131 at 5p15.33 (OR = 0.71, P = 1.70x10 -8). These SNPs represent independent risk variants at previously identified pancreatic cancer risk loci on chr1q32.1 ( NR5A2), chr8q24.21 ( MYC) and chr5p15.33 ( CLPTM1L- TERT) as per analyses conditioned on previously reported susceptibility variants. We assessed expression of candidate genes at the three risk loci in histologically normal ( n = 10) and tumor ( n = 8) derived pancreatic tissue samples and observed a marked reduction of NR5A2 expression (chr1q32.1) in the tumors (fold change -7.6, P = 5.7x10 -8). This finding was validated in a second set of paired ( n = 20) histologically normal and tumor derived pancreatic tissue samples (average fold change for three NR5A2 isoforms -31.3 to -95.7, P = 7.5x10 -4-2.0x10 -3). Our study has identified new susceptibility variants independently conferring pancreatic cancer risk that merit functional follow-up to identify target genes and explain the underlying biology.	 23770605 22675468 25883951 20101243 22384356 25233928 20686608 24581739 23485231 19369583 20852632 22064851 22162228 25027329 19578367 20453196 18978787 24983628 24840647 23645620 17234637 26226901 16904903 23832660 23796952 17572673 24648346 21949357 20972438 19561607 21852532 18978790 19578363 24759568 25122612 7605428 20543847 19200528 25043044 20517342 21620466 10440377 18852200 11162647 24333731 25940397 23535731 25651787 26098869 23598351 21814516 22158540 24861552 20943815 25086665 23206934 19151717 22893025 19648918 18990762 22955989 18794855 24220699 23535824 9454332 23527617 26590902 20981092 15130581 25668599 26742998 21949822 19836008 22037553 19543373 25954001
27492634	Genetic associations with neuroendocrine tumor risk: results from a genome-wide association study.	The etiology of neuroendocrine tumors remains poorly defined. Although neuroendocrine tumors are in some cases associated with inherited genetic syndromes, such syndromes are rare. The majority of neuroendocrine tumors are thought to be sporadic. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify potential genetic risk factors for sporadic neuroendocrine tumors. Using germline DNA from blood specimens, we genotyped 909,622 SNPs using the Affymetrix 6.0 GeneChip, in a cohort comprising 832 neuroendocrine tumor cases from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital and 4542 controls from the Harvard School of Public Health. An additional 241 controls from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute were used for quality control. We assessed risk associations in the overall cohort, and in neuroendocrine tumor subgroups. We identified no potential risk associations in the cohort overall. In the small intestine neuroendocrine tumor subgroup, comprising 293 cases, we identified risk associations with three SNPs on chromosome 12, all in strong LD. The three SNPs are located upstream of ELK3, a transcription factor implicated in angiogenesis. We did not identify clear risk associations in the bronchial or pancreatic neuroendocrine subgroups. This large-scale study provides initial evidence that presumed sporadic small intestine neuroendocrine tumors may have a genetic etiology. Our results provide a basis for further exploring the role of genes implicated in this analysis, and for replication studies to confirm the observed associations. Additional studies to evaluate potential genetic risk factors for sporadic pancreatic and bronchial neuroendocrine tumors are warranted.	 18491401 21139019 16862161 18565894 21606320 26614373 18398037 23500615 26392472 15806399 12975317 25865046 11596039 19150948 21104784 18612155 22659535 21252315 24326773 10080850 24185511 23418310 26356731 22931260 17701901 18776909 17548033 20702402 24771855 27003604 14713256 24670920 10744132 18383209
27479909	Identification of 15 genetic loci associated with risk of major depression in individuals of European descent.	Despite strong evidence supporting the heritability of major depressive disorder (MDD), previous genome-wide studies were unable to identify risk loci among individuals of European descent. We used self-report data from 75,607 individuals reporting clinical diagnosis of depression and 231,747 individuals reporting no history of depression through 23andMe and carried out meta-analysis of these results with published MDD genome-wide association study results. We identified five independent variants from four regions associated with self-report of clinical diagnosis or treatment for depression. Loci with a P value <1.0 × 10(-5) in the meta-analysis were further analyzed in a replication data set (45,773 cases and 106,354 controls) from 23andMe. A total of 17 independent SNPs from 15 regions reached genome-wide significance after joint analysis over all three data sets. Some of these loci were also implicated in genome-wide association studies of related psychiatric traits. These studies provide evidence for large-scale consumer genomic data as a powerful and efficient complement to data collected from traditional means of ascertainment for neuropsychiatric disease genomics.	 21858135 16863597 25827034 23111466 23128226 21926972 25597830 19339358 25056061 25642630 24788602 12499305 24284204 19592390 20585627 25581432 22509285 26176920 23389741 21896369 16731270 7755112 23453885 12063145 22996553 22472876 25338720 17924348 22390724 18599438 14662550 19535594 27089181
27271309	Genome-Wide Gene-Sodium Interaction Analyses on Blood Pressure: The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt-Sensitivity Study.	We performed genome-wide analyses to identify genomic loci that interact with sodium to influence blood pressure (BP) using single-marker-based (1 and 2 df joint tests) and gene-based tests among 1876 Chinese participants of the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt-Sensitivity (GenSalt) study. Among GenSalt participants, the average of 3 urine samples was used to estimate sodium excretion. Nine BP measurements were taken using a random zero sphygmomanometer. A total of 2.05 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms were imputed using Affymetrix 6.0 genotype data and the Chinese Han of Beijing and Japanese of Tokyo HapMap reference panel. Promising findings (P<1.00×10(-4)) from GenSalt were evaluated for replication among 775 Chinese participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Single-nucleotide polymorphism and gene-based results were meta-analyzed across the GenSalt and MESA studies to determine genome-wide significance. The 1 df tests identified interactions for UST rs13211840 on diastolic BP (P=3.13×10(-9)). The 2 df tests additionally identified associations for CLGN rs2567241 (P=3.90×10(-12)) and LOC105369882 rs11104632 (P=4.51×10(-8)) with systolic BP. The CLGN variant rs2567241 was also associated with diastolic BP (P=3.11×10(-22)) and mean arterial pressure (P=2.86×10(-15)). Genome-wide gene-based analysis identified MKNK1 (P=6.70×10(-7)), C2orf80 (P<1.00×10(-12)), EPHA6 (P=2.88×10(-7)), SCOC-AS1 (P=4.35×10(-14)), SCOC (P=6.46×10(-11)), CLGN (P=3.68×10(-13)), MGAT4D (P=4.73×10(-11)), ARHGAP42 (P≤1.00×10(-12)), CASP4 (P=1.31×10(-8)), and LINC01478 (P=6.75×10(-10)) that were associated with at least 1 BP phenotype. In summary, we identified 8 novel and 1 previously reported BP loci through the examination of single-nucleotide polymorphism and gene-based interactions with sodium.	 15652604 12105130 2779627 22246630 21904907 25015694 25940791 24165912 21909110 21572416 19430479 24119990 24664739 20616382 22495127 19705160 20142850 20598278 24175892 20690115 25789451 17283440 24047921 9022560 9634505 21058334 19430483 23408906 17701901 8978826 23251661 11850766 9155017 21181894 21397060 21909115 17443206 23303660
27480026	Genome Wide Association Study Identifies L3MBTL4 as a Novel Susceptibility Gene for Hypertension.	Hypertension is a major global health burden and a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Although its heritability has been documented previously, contributing loci identified to date account for only a small fraction of blood pressure (BP) variation, which strongly suggests the existence of undiscovered variants. To identify novel variants, we conducted a three staged genetic study in 21,990 hypertensive cases and normotensive controls. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at three new genes (L3MBTL4 rs403814, Pmeta = 6.128 × 10(-9); LOC729251, and TCEANC) and seven SNPs at five previously reported genes were identified as being significantly associated with hypertension. Through functional analysis, we found that L3MBTL4 is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and up-regulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats with ubiquitous over-expression of L3MBTL4 exhibited significantly elevated BP, increased thickness of the vascular media layer and cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanistically, L3MBTL4 over-expression could lead to down-regulation of latent transforming growth factor-β binding protein 1 (LTBP1), and phosphorylation activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is known to trigger the pathological progression of vascular remodeling and BP elevation. These findings pinpointed L3MBTL4 as a critical contributor to the development and progression of hypertension and uncovers a novel target for therapeutic intervention.	 11104663 15652604 25027169 20219212 20037604 22071811 23151184 10743502 18562560 24814693 21572416 19430479 20921432 16731270 20616382 26079385 17222674 20698951 16334996 16723511 15956674 26279753 25249183 12153137 18456100 6461865 18228071 23015801 20634204 18337559 17701901 17284699 12423980 19396169 20852445 11891617 22489151 19404732 21082022

27494321	Genome-Wide Association Analyses in 128,266 Individuals Identifies New Morningness and Sleep Duration Loci.	Disrupted circadian rhythms and reduced sleep duration are associated with several human diseases, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes, but until recently, little was known about the genetic factors influencing these heritable traits. We performed genome-wide association studies of self-reported chronotype (morning/evening person) and self-reported sleep duration in 128,266 white British individuals from the UK Biobank study. Sixteen variants were associated with chronotype (P<5x10-8), including variants near the known circadian rhythm genes RGS16 (1.21 odds of morningness, 95% CI [1.15, 1.27], P = 3x10-12) and PER2 (1.09 odds of morningness, 95% CI [1.06, 1.12], P = 4x10-10). The PER2 signal has previously been associated with iris function. We sought replication using self-reported data from 89,283 23andMe participants; thirteen of the chronotype signals remained associated at P<5x10-8 on meta-analysis and eleven of these reached P<0.05 in the same direction in the 23andMe study. We also replicated 9 additional variants identified when the 23andMe study was used as a discovery GWAS of chronotype (all P<0.05 and meta-analysis P<5x10-8). For sleep duration, we replicated one known signal in PAX8 (2.6 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.9, 3.2], P = 5.7x10-16) and identified and replicated two novel associations at VRK2 (2.0 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.3, 2.7], P = 1.2x10-9; and 1.6 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.1, 2.2], P = 7.6x10-9). Although we found genetic correlation between chronotype and BMI (rG = 0.056, P = 0.05); undersleeping and BMI (rG = 0.147, P = 1x10-5) and oversleeping and BMI (rG = 0.097, P = 0.04), Mendelian Randomisation analyses, with limited power, provided no consistent evidence of causal associations between BMI or type 2 diabetes and chronotype or sleep duration.

27503288	Identification of susceptibility gene associated with female primary Sjögren's syndrome in Han Chinese by genome-wide association study.	Primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) is an autoimmune disease targeting exocrine glands. It ten times more dominantly affects women than men with an onset peak at menopause. The genetic factor predisposing women to PSS remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify susceptibility loci for PSS in women. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 242 female PSS patients and 1444 female control in Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan. Replication was conducted in an independent cohort of 178 female PSS and 14,432 control subjects.

27506219	Pooling-Based Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci in the Pathogenesis of Ovarian Endometrioma in Chinese Han Women.	Endometriosis, regarded as a complex disease, is influenced by multiple genetic factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in endometriosis have identified several susceptibility loci in Caucasian and Japanese populations. However, the overlapped susceptible loci were few. This case-control study tried to identify risk loci-related genes for ovarian endometrioma in Chinese Han women from central China using DNA pooling-based GWAS. Genome DNA samples were extracted from 3038 participants in central China. Pooling-based genome-wide scan and individual genotyping were performed using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and IPLEX Gold system, which demonstrated 10 ovarian endometrioma-related novel risk loci. There were 3 of them with P value < 5 × 10	
27501781	Association of variations in HLA class II and other loci with susceptibility to EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma driven by somatic EGFR mutations is more prevalent in East Asians (30-50%) than in European/Americans (10-20%). Here we investigate genetic factors underlying the risk of this disease by conducting a genome-wide association study, followed by two validation studies, in 3,173 Japanese patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma and 15,158 controls. Four loci, 5p15.33 (TERT), 6p21.3 (BTNL2), 3q28 (TP63) and 17q24.2 (BPTF), previously shown to be strongly associated with overall lung adenocarcinoma risk in East Asians, were re-discovered as loci associated with a higher susceptibility to EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, two additional loci, HLA class II at 6p21.32 (rs2179920; P =5.1 × 10(-17), per-allele OR=1.36) and 6p21.1 (FOXP4) (rs2495239; P=3.9 × 10(-9), per-allele OR=1.19) were newly identified as loci associated with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. This study indicates that multiple genetic factors underlie the risk of lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations.	 20871597 26432245 25855068 25870798 16862161 11932250 17982410 22138821 23921082 17054433 21318227 18385676 12045153 19715440 26149460 26732429 21311943 24981256 17882278 12697658 20356827 17565015 23143601 18385738 22327624 16938658 26029868 24880342 18429954 25079552 24174329 25338720 22730293 20634204 17701901 23552377 22797724 19836008 26657631
27527254	Genome-wide association studies in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's oesophagus: a large-scale meta-analysis.	Oesophageal adenocarcinoma represents one of the fastest rising cancers in high-income countries. Barrett's oesophagus is the premalignant precursor of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, only a few patients with Barrett's oesophagus develop adenocarcinoma, which complicates clinical management in the absence of valid predictors. Within an international consortium investigating the genetics of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, we aimed to identify novel genetic risk variants for the development of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.	 21995385 22783391 13621476 25597830 25530442 22138821 24121790 24287640 22064851 22961001 22820512 26254683 24964289 21544814 23178438 20616382 22694245 24702953 22777342 12163954 20598278 26395488 24168968 25447851 17554300 25653097 23462326 2570460 20634204 21793864 17701901 22426310 20094044 20981092 25673413 25162890 19543373 24013639
27529621	The First Pilot Genome-Wide Gene-Environment Study of Depression in the Japanese Population.	Stressful events have been identified as a risk factor for depression. Although gene-environment (G × E) interaction in a limited number of candidate genes has been explored, no genome-wide search has been reported. The aim of the present study is to identify genes that influence the association of stressful events with depression. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide G × E interaction analysis in the Japanese population. A genome-wide screen with 320 subjects was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human Array 6.0. Stressful life events were assessed using the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) and depression symptoms were assessed with self-rating questionnaires using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. The p values for interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and stressful events were calculated using the linear regression model adjusted for sex and age. After quality control of genotype data, a total of 534,848 SNPs on autosomal chromosomes were further analyzed. Although none surpassed the level of the genome-wide significance, a marginal significant association of interaction between SRRS and rs10510057 with depression were found (p = 4.5 × 10-8). The SNP is located on 10q26 near Regulators of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), which encodes a regulatory molecule involved in stress response. When we investigated a similar G × E interaction between depression (K6 scale) and work-related stress in an independent sample (n = 439), a significant G × E effect on depression was observed (p = 0.015). Our findings suggest that rs10510057, interacting with stressors, may be involved in depression risk. Incorporating G × E interaction into GWAS can contribute to find susceptibility locus that are potentially missed by conventional GWAS. 	 16611461 10165981 23397581 11443111 12869766 12813115 15482592 24507187 11982537 8453431 15939839 23759276 7792364 19065144 10966476 9315921 6059863 25563565 9881538 22614290 18534686 20124111 12545237 22564151 9824167 8910288 21851452 20516156 18817904 17283440 22472876 19825262 16048450 20125088 2265888 3830325 9164317 17701901 20074509 23290196 24956270 22056472 20231323 11007705 21225419 12912762 17938638 9300515 25364288 12214795 20488544 20468064

27539887	Genome-wide association study identifies 14 novel risk alleles associated with basal cell carcinoma.	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer worldwide with an annual incidence of 2.8 million cases in the United States alone. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between 21 distinct genetic loci and BCC risk. Here, we report the results of a two-stage genome-wide association study of BCC, totalling 17,187 cases and 287,054 controls. We confirm 17 previously reported loci and identify 14 new susceptibility loci reaching genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8), logistic regression). These newly associated SNPs lie within predicted keratinocyte regulatory elements and in expression quantitative trait loci; furthermore, we identify candidate genes and non-coding RNAs involved in telomere maintenance, immune regulation and tumour progression, providing deeper insight into the pathogenesis of BCC.	 25328065 19340423 18974171 21526222 18543608 16862161 25600812 25928629 24457966 21946351 18596976 19701494 19769716 24121790 18442402 22064851 18849993 25868035 20585627 26237428 21700618 26016895 16473602 22509285 26463994 26686553 22690667 17496320 10861063 22955616 22125590 25705849 25797262 20019748 25329375 20689760 26835600 20647273 17934731 22763445 11752295 21873432 24403052 23001564 23523330 3962971 19648290 19151717 25338720 1669486 16943234 17924348 20634204 24916375 12145550 20622878 25855136 10075714 23817569 25217961 11299819 26381319 24686420 20421499 20981092 26562150 23254909 21441907 20410501 22955990 25954001 10472945 19732724 17614763
27548383	Genetic Analysis with the Immunochip Platform in Behçet Disease. Identification of Residues Associated in the HLA Class I Region and New Susceptibility Loci.	Behcet's disease (BD) is an immuno-mediated vasculitis in which knowledge of its etiology and genetic basis is limited. To improve the current knowledge, a genetic analysis performed with the Immunochip platform was carried out in a population from Spain. A discovery cohort comprising 278 BD cases and 1,517 unaffected controls were genotyped using the Immunochip platform. The validation step was performed on an independent replication cohort composed of 130 BD cases and 600 additional controls. The strongest association signals were observed in the HLA class I region, being HLA-B*51 the highest peak (overall P = 6.82E-32, OR = 3.82). A step-wise conditional logistic regression with classical alleles identified HLA-B*57 and HLA-A*03 as additional independent markers. The amino acid model that best explained the association, includes the position 97 of the HLA-B molecule and the position 66 of the HLA-A. Among the non-HLA loci, the most significant in the discovery analysis were: IL23R (rs10889664: P = 3.81E-12, OR = 2.00), the JRKL/CNTN5 region (rs2848479: P = 5.00E-08, OR = 1.68) and IL12A (rs1874886: P = 6.67E-08, OR = 1.72), which were confirmed in the validation phase (JRKL/CNTN5 rs2848479: P = 3.29E-10, OR = 1.66; IL12A rs1874886: P = 1.62E-08, OR = 1.61). Our results confirm HLA-B*51 as a primary-association marker in predisposition to BD and suggest additional independent signals within the class I region, specifically in the genes HLA-A and HLA-B. Regarding the non-HLA genes, in addition to IL-23R, previously reported in our population; IL12A, described in other populations, was found to be a BD susceptibility factor also in Spaniards; finally, a new associated locus was found in the JRKL/CNTN5 region. 	 23830517 22976473 1970380 23041938 24821759 23143596 23143594 10975842 22286218 15719024 25799145 23762245 19442274 20622879 25405820 24625627 26258845 19790126 23001997 19262165 15264254 22949325 22143225 25019531 19200528 23749187 10528040 23396137 26347074 21543847 21345260 19143809 23291587 19324519 24387989 16998491 26218850 25817017 24286189 12697453 20622878 17701901 22057235 18941220 23773860 10393610
27559109	A genome-wide association meta-analysis of diarrhoeal disease in young children identifies FUT2 locus and provides plausible biological pathways.	More than a million childhood diarrhoeal episodes occur worldwide each year, and in developed countries a considerable part of them are caused by viral infections. In this study, we aimed to search for genetic variants associated with diarrhoeal disease in young children by meta-analyzing genome-wide association studies, and to elucidate plausible biological mechanisms. The study was conducted in the context of the Early Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) consortium. Data about diarrhoeal disease in two time windows (around 1 year of age and around 2 years of age) was obtained via parental questionnaires, doctor interviews or medical records. Standard quality control and statistical tests were applied to the 1000 Genomes imputed genotypic data. The meta-analysis (N = 5758) followed by replication (N = 3784) identified a genome-wide significant association between rs8111874 and diarrhoea at age 1 year. Conditional analysis suggested that the causal variant could be rs601338 (W154X) in the FUT2 gene. Children with the A allele, which results in a truncated FUT2 protein, had lower risk of diarrhoea. FUT2 participates in the production of histo-blood group antigens and has previously been implicated in the susceptibility to infections, including Rotavirus and Norovirus Gene-set enrichment analysis suggested pathways related to the histo-blood group antigen production, and the regulation of ion transport and blood pressure. Among others, the gastrointestinal tract, and the immune and neuro-secretory systems were detected as relevant organs. In summary, this genome-wide association meta-analysis suggests the implication of the FUT2 gene in diarrhoeal disease in young children from the general population.	 14987892 15367586 19744961 18498114 23754956 21489842 24326010 6805820 22482804 24811271 2631880 25214634 23935489 20041166 20570966 25597830 3347221 22004137 23420232 21896673 22064851 23959967 22433979 22049044 24733310 24781901 9291346 17245723 25274297 23128233 12010227 21502085 23680352 2876155 17204802 11535550 8569809 2874307 19633551 24212883 21993531 17094741 17537929 25518859 17008174 21051598 22504179 20064070 11069230 22345472 23691339 19487333 22258240 18382740 22068912 23713234 21058334 24277741 22610502 15035633 23582727 16306606 20509871 20634204 19754311 21364930 14997420 19457420 21167468 26390057 20714348 23616650 23830146 19440360 19115949 19543373 11522384

27569725	Identification of Loci at 1q21 and 16q23 That Affect Susceptibility to Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Koreans.	Recent genome-wide association studies have identified more than 200 regions that affect susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, identified common variants account for only a fraction of IBD heritability and largely have been identified in populations of European ancestry. We performed a genome-wide association study of susceptibility loci in Korean individuals, comprising a total of 1505 IBD patients and 4041 controls. We identified 2 new susceptibility loci for IBD at genome-wide significance: rs3766920 near PYGO2-SHC1 at 1q21 and rs16953946 in CDYL2 at 16q23. In addition, we confirmed associations, in Koreans, with 28 established IBD loci (P < 2.16 × 10	
27560520	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Multiple Loci Influencing Normal Human Facial Morphology.	Numerous lines of evidence point to a genetic basis for facial morphology in humans, yet little is known about how specific genetic variants relate to the phenotypic expression of many common facial features. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of 20 quantitative facial measurements derived from the 3D surface images of 3118 healthy individuals of European ancestry belonging to two US cohorts. Analyses were performed on just under one million genotyped SNPs (Illumina OmniExpress+Exome v1.2 array) imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel (Phase 3). We observed genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 x 10-8) for cranial base width at 14q21.1 and 20q12, intercanthal width at 1p13.3 and Xq13.2, nasal width at 20p11.22, nasal ala length at 14q11.2, and upper facial depth at 11q22.1. Several genes in the associated regions are known to play roles in craniofacial development or in syndromes affecting the face: MAFB, PAX9, MIPOL1, ALX3, HDAC8, and PAX1. We also tested genotype-phenotype associations reported in two previous genome-wide studies and found evidence of replication for nasal ala length and SNPs in CACNA2D3 and PRDM16. These results provide further evidence that common variants in regions harboring genes of known craniofacial function contribute to normal variation in human facial features. Improved understanding of the genes associated with facial morphology in healthy individuals can provide insights into the pathways and mechanisms controlling normal and abnormal facial morphogenesis. 	 19409524 24080012 26492185 11156997 19344888 19447840 17105336 15716906 19840279 22384356 11476577 18405826 22341974 25375250 22885700 23128226 12700605 23028347 20718045 22560091 15820308 21694738 22889856 16409383 11419342 24339768 18203157 20826528 25026904 21458441 17097601 24738728 26097051 16077740 24654940 24651127 11395710 23851939 20940257 26523602 20106874 18757921 15879175 11553097 24998929 9732271 24462371 24124047 24146773 26671848 20446819 25859222 23070782 19605684 17701901 20436469 23269371 19815155 19166470 11641221 19543373 4044786 17381053 8885715
27561104	Non-additive genome-wide association scan reveals a new gene associated with habitual coffee consumption.	Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages world-wide and one of the primary sources of caffeine intake. Given its important health and economic impact, the underlying genetics of its consumption has been widely studied. Despite these efforts, much has still to be uncovered. In particular, the use of non-additive genetic models may uncover new information about the genetic variants driving coffee consumption. We have conducted a genome-wide association study in two Italian populations using additive, recessive and dominant models for analysis. This has uncovered a significant association in the PDSS2 gene under the recessive model that has been replicated in an independent cohort from the Netherlands (ERF). The identified gene has been shown to negatively regulate the expression of the caffeine metabolism genes and can thus be linked to coffee consumption. Further bioinformatics analysis of eQTL and histone marks from Roadmap data has evidenced a possible role of the identified SNPs in regulating PDSS2 gene expression through enhancers present in its intron. Our results highlight a novel gene which regulates coffee consumption by regulating the expression of the genes linked to caffeine metabolism. Further studies will be needed to clarify the biological mechanism which links PDSS2 and coffee consumption.	 14334284 17186472 17352422 24141950 17384015 23128226 23150520 22064851 21493956 22820512 17126666 11112231 22955616 15200409 25288136 21876539 16022745 27347381 21490707 23715323 15054401 18228557 26226460 23269371 21567994 12433517 10100809 17924335 6377891 15010442 19543373 15105411 14022714

27500523	Variation in the glucose transporter gene SLC2A2 is associated with glycemic response to metformin.	Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic drug with over 100 million users worldwide, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here the Metformin Genetics (MetGen) Consortium reports a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS), consisting of 13,123 participants of different ancestries. The C allele of rs8192675 in the intron of SLC2A2, which encodes the facilitated glucose transporter GLUT2, was associated with a 0.17% (P = 6.6 × 10(-14)) greater metformin-induced reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in 10,577 participants of European ancestry. rs8192675 was the top cis expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for SLC2A2 in 1,226 human liver samples, suggesting a key role for hepatic GLUT2 in regulation of metformin action. Among obese individuals, C-allele homozygotes at rs8192675 had a 0.33% (3.6 mmol/mol) greater absolute HbA1c reduction than T-allele homozygotes. This was about half the effect seen with the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor, and equated to a dose difference of 550 mg of metformin, suggesting rs8192675 as a potential biomarker for stratified medicine.	 20858683 11118008 16862161 26528626 26780750 22722338 26624892 20682687 24606093 21852673 22882994 23474282 19794412 24847880 9742977 9742976 23267855 25350695 26092716 22453232 17572673 23292513 25060887 18462017 15397919 11016447 23549084 21637794 3153325 11882499 25963904 7623902 23268600 17609683 22885924 19336679 22006096 24185692 20509871 17701901 19307526 21186350 24731673 20484130 22885922 22171328 22442396 19543373 19878986 17145742 25954001
27588450	Trans-ethnic Fine Mapping Highlights Kidney-Function Genes Linked to Salt Sensitivity.	We analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including data from 71,638 individuals from four ancestries, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function used to define chronic kidney disease (CKD). We identified 20 loci attaining genome-wide-significant evidence of association (p < 5 × 10(-8)) with kidney function and highlighted that allelic effects on eGFR at lead SNPs are homogeneous across ancestries. We leveraged differences in the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between diverse populations to fine-map the 20 loci through construction of "credible sets" of variants driving eGFR association signals. Credible variants at the 20 eGFR loci were enriched for DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) in human kidney cells. DHS credible variants were expression quantitative trait loci for NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues. Loss-of-function mutations in ancestral orthologs of both genes in Drosophila melanogaster were associated with altered sensitivity to salt stress. Renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 in a salt-sensitive mouse model was also reduced after exposure to a high-salt diet or induced CKD. Our study (1) demonstrates the utility of trans-ethnic fine mapping through integration of GWASs involving diverse populations with genomic annotation from relevant tissues to define molecular mechanisms by which association signals exert their effect and (2) suggests that salt sensitivity might be an important marker for biological processes that affect kidney function and CKD in humans. 	 11315092 23882224 17368199 11904577 23128226 22138821 17943122 22125221 19822795 21840587 20944595 25439723 8743503 26097778 22820512 26189819 17786212 23022100 26831199 22955616 26927006 8307628 20616382 26647426 24702953 20595688 22797727 17563570 21088577 24048198 21778236 23406875 20383146 17329578 26139635 23052657 23586973 23263488 24762786 25493955 25082825 20509871 21255223 22479191 24413736 14333330 23104008 24127591 20126254 17851470 26337134 20981092 10950394 19543373 20208533

28171663	Genome-wide association studies in women of African ancestry identified 3q26.21 as a novel susceptibility locus for oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer.	Multiple breast cancer loci have been identified in previous genome-wide association studies, but they were mainly conducted in populations of European ancestry. Women of African ancestry are more likely to have young-onset and oestrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer for reasons that are unknown and understudied. To identify genetic risk factors for breast cancer in women of African descent, we conducted a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies of breast cancer; one study consists of 1,657 cases and 2,029 controls genotyped with Illumina’s HumanOmni2.5 BeadChip and the other study included 3,016 cases and 2,745 controls genotyped using Illumina Human1M-Duo BeadChip. The top 18,376 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from the meta-analysis were replicated in the third study that consists of 1,984 African Americans cases and 2,939 controls. We found that SNP rs13074711, 26.5 Kb upstream of TNFSF10 at 3q26.21, was significantly associated with risk of oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer (odds ratio [OR]=1.29, 95% CI: 1.18-1.40; P = 1.8 × 10 − 8). Functional annotations suggest that the TNFSF10 gene may be involved in breast cancer aetiology, but further functional experiments are needed. In addition, we confirmed SNP rs10069690 was the best indicator for ER-negative breast cancer at 5p15.33 (OR = 1.30; P = 2.4 × 10 − 10) and identified rs12998806 as the best indicator for ER-positive breast cancer at 2q35 (OR = 1.34; P = 2.2 × 10 − 8) for women of African ancestry. These findings demonstrated additional susceptibility alleles for breast cancer can be revealed in diverse populations and have important public health implications in building race/ethnicity-specific risk prediction model for breast cancer.	 22357627 19219042 21852243 23535731 25651787 20852631 24948009 23535733 8777713 20453838 18266105 23136140 23535729 22923054 25751625 22037553 19543373 25954001 16757721 20517342 17529973 17529974 19330030 22267197 25202974 25248036 22064851 24013639 24343304 22685416 22976474 17529967 18438407 19330027 19704069 21526222 21263130 25693563 19789366
27595289	Novel HLA-DP region susceptibility loci associated with severe acute GvHD.	Despite HLA allele matching, significant acute GvHD remains a major barrier to successful unrelated donor BMT. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify recipient and donor genes associated with the risk of acute GvHD. A case-control design (grade III-IV versus no acute GvHD) and pooled GWA approach was used to study European-American recipients with hematological malignancies who received myeloablative conditioning non-T-cell-depleted first transplantation from HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 allele level (10/10) matched unrelated donors. DNA samples were divided into three pools and tested in triplicate using the Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP Array 6.0. We identified three novel susceptibility loci in the HLA-DP region of recipient genomes that were associated with III-IV acute GvHD (rs9277378, P=1.58E-09; rs9277542, P=1.548E-06 and rs9277341, P=7.718E-05). Of these three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9277378 and rs9277542 are located in non-coding regions of the HLA-DPB1 gene and the two are in strong linkage disequilibrium with two other published SNPs associated with acute GvHD, rs2281389 and rs9277535. Eighteen other recipient SNPs and 3 donor SNPs with a high level of significance (8E-07 or lower) were found. Our report contributes to emerging data showing clinical significance of the HLA-DP region genetic markers beyond structural matching of DPB1 alleles.	 16399580 1689009 19492015 17785583 18276640 17008540 17671248 23128233 20100586 7620183 19349983 21051598 20811451 11896281 7581076 22496224 23449268 22170232 23825586 7679561 22737229 22340965 26267621 22837536 21346778 17160900 19417063

27476799	Novel Genetic Variants Associated With Increased Vertebral Volumetric BMD, Reduced Vertebral Fracture Risk, and Increased Expression of SLC1A3 and EPHB2.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed numerous loci for areal bone mineral density (aBMD). We completed the first GWAS meta-analysis (n = 15,275) of lumbar spine volumetric BMD (vBMD) measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT), allowing for examination of the trabecular bone compartment. SNPs that were significantly associated with vBMD were also examined in two GWAS meta-analyses to determine associations with morphometric vertebral fracture (n = 21,701) and clinical vertebral fracture (n = 5893). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of iliac crest biopsies were performed in 84 postmenopausal women, and murine osteoblast expression of genes implicated by eQTL or by proximity to vBMD-associated SNPs was examined. We identified significant vBMD associations with five loci, including: 1p36.12, containing WNT4 and ZBTB40; 8q24, containing TNFRSF11B; and 13q14, containing AKAP11 and TNFSF11. Two loci (5p13 and 1p36.12) also contained associations with radiographic and clinical vertebral fracture, respectively. In 5p13, rs2468531 (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 3%) was associated with higher vBMD (β = 0.22, p = 1.9 × 10	 23925651 25693563 17351290 12378368 23437003 22644325 16084776 24516880 16890539 26524708 22055140 21445249 22064851 11316002 19073177 19841454 21069292 25003811 19922823 23389618 17222801 17044846 17967568 26695485 1785377 22805710 22350511 22430313 9071469 25573264 20200990 24677183 20513753 22504420 21533022 22222934 23959594 15800289 25643922 21153022 18445777 8237484 23606843 22143959 26367794 2318940 22888325 23165727 21167468 25299585 7572313 25108526 20807844 22373907 20548944 15499007 10050823

27643478	A genome-wide association study of emotion dysregulation: Evidence for interleukin 2 receptor alpha.	Emotion dysregulation has been implicated as a risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. Therefore, examining genetic risk associated with emotion dysregulation could help inform cross-disorder risk more generally. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of emotion dysregulation using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology was conducted in a highly traumatized, minority, urban sample (N = 2600, males = 774). Post-hoc analyses examined associations between SNPs identified in the GWAS and current depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and history of suicide attempt. Methylation quantitative trait loci were identified and gene set enrichment analyses were used to broadly determine biological processes involved with these SNPs. Among males, SNP rs6602398, located within the interleukin receptor 2A gene, IL2RA, was significantly associated with emotion dysregulation (p = 1.1 × 10	 25468625 3827692 23972291 16199517 20679588 23703215 12869766 23933821 16862161 15703352 22570697 21546839 16091861 11806019 19301118 25993607 18574615 10415599 19892208 11467252 23487197 19194374 21658350 21350482 24533643 1563036 24670968 24468824 11719636 14663036 25784220 24163133 17146014 23453885 12480034 16632515 22294642 23786688 24789456 16530463 15509284 16248685 24388013 23175756 17805313 20634204 12212647 18258310 26041818 19621016 22197082 20050965 17701901 25290268 20819988 15980575 23896009 15386212 20015584 20659789 17726476 20161813 9160222 25360393 15774430

28173075	Metformin pharmacogenomics: a genome-wide association study to identify genetic and epigenetic biomarkers involved in metformin anticancer response using human lymphoblastoid cell lines.	Metformin is currently considered as a promising anticancer agent in addition to its anti-diabetic effect. To better individualize metformin therapy and explore novel molecular mechanisms in cancer treatment, we conducted a pharmacogenomic study using 266 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Metformin cytotoxicity assay was performed using the MTS assay. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed in LCLs using 1.3 million SNPs, 485k DNA methylation probes, 54k mRNA expression probe sets, and metformin cytotoxicity (IC50s). Top candidate genes were functionally validated using siRNA screening, followed by MTS assay in breast cancer cell lines. Further study of one top candidate, STUB1, was performed to elucidate the mechanisms by which STUB1 might contribute to metformin action. GWA analyses in LCLs identified 198 mRNA expression probe sets, 12 SNP loci, and 5 DNA methylation loci associated with metformin IC50 with P-values <10−4 or <10−5. Integrated SNP/methylation loci-expression-IC50 analyses found 3 SNP loci or 5 DNA methylation loci associated with metformin IC50 through trans-regulation of expression of 11 or 26 genes with P-value <10−4. Functional validation of top 61 candidate genes in 4 IPA networks indicated down regulation of 14 genes significantly altered metformin sensitivity in two breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, STUB1, could influence metformin response by facilitating proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin A. GWAS using a genomic data-enriched LCL model system, together with functional and mechanistic studies using cancer cell lines, help us to identify novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers involved in metformin anticancer response.	 23999444 19440038 22689798 20554718 22926251 22722338 23435786 22189713 19465479 18401339 24393785 20682687 20337599 25454945 25060891 26528626 21989078 22453232 17176475 25648825 22809961 18728938 25866793 26688757 23580781 20859243 24670634 25722852 23395946 18757419 26196392 20876420 20567254 25753371 24901568 19228809 23894862 24324494 23863712 24504677 21860411 20215500 19895632 15115282 19172157 25682077 26067687 21186350 23314698 23908385 24731673 22635276 20923822 24853734 17476355 19381165 24009623
27618452	The genetics of blood pressure regulation and its target organs from association studies in 342,415 individuals.	To dissect the genetic architecture of blood pressure and assess effects on target organ damage, we analyzed 128,272 SNPs from targeted and genome-wide arrays in 201,529 individuals of European ancestry, and genotypes from an additional 140,886 individuals were used for validation. We identified 66 blood pressure-associated loci, of which 17 were new; 15 harbored multiple distinct association signals. The 66 index SNPs were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, consistent with a primary role in blood pressure control through modulation of vascular tone across multiple tissues. The 66 index SNPs combined in a risk score showed comparable effects in 64,421 individuals of non-European descent. The 66-SNP blood pressure risk score was significantly associated with target organ damage in multiple tissues but with minor effects in the kidney. Our findings expand current knowledge of blood pressure-related pathways and highlight tissues beyond the classical renal system in blood pressure regulation.	 18763692 25693563 24846176 17254420 22876189 23771844 7721434 17429603 17903302 23883378 17179217 25597830 24954895 18332286 25409825 24316577 21737788 23972371 21909110 13935402 21572416 19430479 19219041 20686565 22955616 15060114 24975945 16152135 24604202 24560520 15607018 24213632 19114657 25673412 23263488 19430483 20509871 25826379 11857564 25174004 22426310 21167468 20714348 21909115 25673413 22955828 21441907 21082022
27623284	Epistatic Gene-Based Interaction Analyses for Glaucoma in eMERGE and NEIGHBOR Consortium.	Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex disease and is one of the major leading causes of blindness worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified several common variants associated with glaucoma; however, most of these variants only explain a small proportion of the genetic risk. Apart from the standard approach to identify main effects of variants across the genome, it is believed that gene-gene interactions can help elucidate part of the missing heritability by allowing for the test of interactions between genetic variants to mimic the complex nature of biology. To explain the etiology of glaucoma, we first performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on glaucoma case-control samples obtained from electronic medical records (EMR) to establish the utility of EMR data in detecting non-spurious and relevant associations; this analysis was aimed at confirming already known associations with glaucoma and validating the EMR derived glaucoma phenotype. Our findings from GWAS suggest consistent evidence of several known associations in POAG. We then performed an interaction analysis for variants found to be marginally associated with glaucoma (SNPs with main effect p-value <0.01) and observed interesting findings in the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics Network (eMERGE) network dataset. Genes from the top epistatic interactions from eMERGE data (Likelihood Ratio Test i.e. LRT p-value <1e-05) were then tested for replication in the NEIGHBOR consortium dataset. To replicate our findings, we performed a gene-based SNP-SNP interaction analysis in NEIGHBOR and observed significant gene-gene interactions (p-value <0.001) among the top 17 gene-gene models identified in the discovery phase. Variants from gene-gene interaction analysis that we found to be associated with POAG explain 3.5% of additional genetic variance in eMERGE dataset above what is explained by the SNPs in genes that are replicated from previous GWAS studies (which was only 2.1% variance explained in eMERGE dataset); in the NEIGHBOR dataset, adding replicated SNPs from gene-gene interaction analysis explain 3.4% of total variance whereas GWAS SNPs alone explain only 2.8% of variance. Exploring gene-gene interactions may provide additional insights into many complex traits when explored in properly designed and powered association studies.	 18987709 21158748 24003086 10413599 23291589 16862161 17122126 20811162 21269473 17384015 22223662 25915600 10441592 25861811 21149340 25173105 19293820 24987407 3425269 22661486 22814818 24316577 9005853 23743551 22171998 20858511 17952072 19919682 15659551 19434077 15640920 24003087 22654671 21656515 22665138 24296533 23275912 16973151 25566314 20479774 3386742 11838787 23500522 11907579 19066216 22312193 26752265 12819783 16276119 20835238 19503614 21167468 24817878 22828004 22570617 23468652 19057895
27622933	Analysis of 23andMe antidepressant efficacy survey data: implication of circadian rhythm and neuroplasticity in bupropion response.	Genetic predisposition may contribute to the differences in drug-specific, class-specific or antidepressant-wide treatment resistance. Clinical studies with the genetic data are often limited in sample sizes. Drug response obtained from self-reports may offer an alternative approach to conduct a study with much larger sample size. Using the phenotype data collected from 23andMe 'Antidepressant Efficacy and Side Effects' survey and genotype data from 23andMe's research participants, we conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) on subjects of European ancestry using four groups of phenotypes (a) non-treatment-resistant depression (n=7795) vs treatment-resistant depression (TRD, n=1311), (b) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) responders (n=6348) vs non-responders (n=3340), (c) citalopram/escitalopram responders (n=2963) vs non-responders (n=2005), and (d) norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI, bupropion) responders (n=2675) vs non-responders (n=1861). Each of these subgroups was also compared with controls (n ~ 190 000). The most significant association was from bupropion responders vs non-responders analysis. Variant rs1908557 (P=2.6 × 10(-8), OR=1.35) passed the conventional genome-wide significance threshold (P=5 × 10(-8)) and was located within the intron of human spliced expressed sequence tags in chromosome 4. Gene sets associated with long-term depression, circadian rhythm and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway were enriched in the bupropion analysis. No single-nucleotide polymorphism passed genome-wide significance threshold in other analyses. The heritability estimates for each response group compared with controls were between 0.15 and 0.25, consistent with the known heritability for major depressive disorder.	 21858135 21926974 23468642 25628336 26005851 12753562 21926972 7877114 25642630 25073688 25607358 20585627 18923511 22493691 25892098 23377640 19846067 23453885 26835600 22832735 26210676 18358625 25525361 9857980 22472876 25201053 22907730 21738487 19736353 26122586 20634204 20360315 21962378 20075918 25174004 22513993 20981092 18922242

It includes the variants rs16974263 (P = 1.77 × 10(-7), OR = 1.59), rs268662 (P = 1.564 × 10(-6), OR = 1.54), and rs4150992 (P = 3.37 × 10(-6), OR = 1.52), and harbors the genes PLD3, SERTAD1, SERTAD3, HIPK4, PRX, and BLVRB, all in strong linkage disequilibrium. In a sub-phenotype analysis of the 512 patients with chronic otitis media with effusion, one marker reached genome-wide significance (rs16974263, P = 2.92 × 10(-8)). The association to this locus was confirmed but with an association signal in the opposite direction, in a UK family cohort of 4860 subjects (rs16974263, P = 3.21 × 10(-4), OR = 0.72; rs4150992, P = 1.62 × 10(-4), OR = 0.71). Thus we hypothesize that this region is important for COME risk in both the Finnish and UK populations, although the precise risk variants or haplotype background remain unclear. Our study suggests that the identified region on chromosome 19 includes a novel and previously uncharacterized risk locus for OM.	 16893079 9631643 21889216 24321399 16298785 21857919 24949855 1870869 12590978 22399527 24718616 19094933 17908769 26177520 19522649 22886440 26055429 15514890 18560870 22792080 15297300 11512079 24463810 25703553 17142509 19481673 16893989 16750996 21293382 20634204 19222419 23721865 17701901 21943191 23929584 19718741 16847180 24819621 19543373 19462432 11784248

27656708	Genome-wide association reveals that common genetic variation in the kallikrein-kinin system is associated with serum L-arginine levels.	L-arginine is the essential precursor of nitric oxide, and is involved in multiple key physiological processes, including vascular and immune function. The genetic regulation of blood L-arginine levels is largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic factors determining serum L-arginine levels, amongst 901 Europeans and 1,394 Indian Asians. We show that common genetic variations at the KLKB1 and F12 loci are strongly associated with serum L-arginine levels.

27670397	Genome-wide association study suggests common variants within RP11-634B7.4 gene influencing severe pre-treatment pain in head and neck cancer patients.	Pain is often one of the first signs of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Pain at diagnosis is an important prognostic marker for the development of chronic pain, and importantly, for the overall survival time. To identify variants influencing severe pre-treatment pain in 1,368 patients newly diagnosed with HNSCC, we conducted a genome-wide association study based on 730,525 tagging SNPs. The patients were all previously untreated for cancer. About 15% of the patients had severe pre-treatment pain, defined as pain score ≥7 (0 = "no pain" and 10 = "worst pain"). We identified 3 common genetic variants in high linkage disequilibrium for severe pre-treatment pain, representing one genomic region at 1q44 (rs3862188, P = 3.45 × 10	 23524338 26432245 21926972 19578367 19098911 24924000 11195407 26940689 9875838 11888722 23241557 21217695 23186999 19056482 19383089 16415888 22307695 20018918 17156920 14641250 27454463 20454541 25219547 24999593 17701901 25369213 23056513 20544225 25513961 18599554 26872611 21966277 26742998 16175505 25043982 25903517 19303166 18987734 26590341 24800820 18441336

Although multiple genes have been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD), they explain only a small proportion of its heritability. Identifying additional BD risk variants may be impaired by phenotypic heterogeneity, which is usually not taken into account in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). BD with early age at onset is a more homogeneous familial form of the disorder associated with greater symptom severity.	
27618448	Meta-analysis identifies common and rare variants influencing blood pressure and overlapping with metabolic trait loci.	Meta-analyses of association results for blood pressure using exome-centric single-variant and gene-based tests identified 31 new loci in a discovery stage among 146,562 individuals, with follow-up and meta-analysis in 180,726 additional individuals (total n = 327,288). These blood pressure-associated loci are enriched for known variants for cardiometabolic traits. Associations were also observed for the aggregation of rare and low-frequency missense variants in three genes, NPR1, DBH, and PTPMT1. In addition, blood pressure associations at 39 previously reported loci were confirmed. The identified variants implicate biological pathways related to cardiometabolic traits, vascular function, and development. Several new variants are inferred to have roles in transcription or as hubs in protein-protein interaction networks. Genetic risk scores constructed from the identified variants were strongly associated with coronary disease and myocardial infarction. This large collection of blood pressure-associated loci suggests new therapeutic strategies for hypertension, emphasizing a link with cardiometabolic risk.	 24981077 22532805 20584205 26061376 24097068 16039589 22763847 20881240 23565321 9482923 24337295 21926972 22622230 17101154 22233601 22685416 23245609 22064851 23474282 23315928 5564906 24316577 20833654 23972371 21909110 19128478 18391953 17066054 19430479 21386085 18462017 11867360 9405681 21102462 20383145 20639392 24931982 20935629 16285859 17804836 21422096 20502693 15928243 18587394 24560520 24439384 23874508 23768516 25108383 24710510 18088408 22100073 2300263 19430483 22955989 25247988 20346437 21737059 1097150 11857564 21666692 24336170 20031578 8621801 23346356 22028891 11891501 14693718 18463668 21909115 3010116 21444836 18691683 26934567 8853987 22566624 21605215 17032721 24013639 23303523

27618447	Trans-ancestry meta-analyses identify rare and common variants associated with blood pressure and hypertension.	High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature death. However, there is limited knowledge on specific causal genes and pathways. To better understand the genetics of blood pressure, we genotyped 242,296 rare, low-frequency and common genetic variants in up to 192,763 individuals and used ∼155,063 samples for independent replication. We identified 30 new blood pressure- or hypertension-associated genetic regions in the general population, including 3 rare missense variants in RBM47, COL21A1 and RRAS with larger effects (>1.5 mm Hg/allele) than common variants. Multiple rare nonsense and missense variant associations were found in A2ML1, and a low-frequency nonsense variant in ENPEP was identified. Our data extend the spectrum of allelic variation underlying blood pressure traits and hypertension, provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hypertension and indicate new targets for clinical intervention.	 20231535 24097068 20445134 11827793 21378990 26162070 23245609 24954895 21304890 25500260 25625282 24830394 25767283 21909110 24939586 25282103 24881994 21060006 20616382 21670282 19584346 24952745 16152135 19481926 15525681 24560520 24038582 23583979 23661711 22100073 10521860 25826379 23041239 23023704 21737059 24336170 26368830 25882670 22443383 25632051 19264985 21378988 20714348 21909115 25673413 18691683 24697296 23591257 25954001 23303523
27702942	Trans-ethnic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for Hirschsprung disease.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is the most common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction. It is characterized by the absence of ganglia in the nerve plexuses of the lower gastrointestinal tract. So far, three common disease-susceptibility variants at the RET, SEMA3 and NRG1 loci have been detected through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Europeans and Asians to understand its genetic etiologies. Here we present a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of 507 HSCR cases and 1191 controls, combining all published GWAS results on HSCR to fine-map these loci and narrow down the putatively causal variants to 99% credible sets. We also demonstrate that the effects of RET and NRG1 are universal across European and Asian ancestries. In contrast, we detected a European-specific association of a low-frequency variant, rs80227144, in SEMA3 [odds ratio (OR) = 5.2, P = 4.7 × 10-10]. Conditional analyses on the lead SNPs revealed a secondary association signal, corresponding to an Asian-specific, low-frequency missense variant encoding RET p.Asp489Asn (rs9282834, conditional OR = 20.3, conditional P = 4.1 × 10-14). When in trans with the RET intron 1 enhancer risk allele, rs9282834 increases the risk of HSCR from 1.1 to 26.7. Overall, our study provides further insights into the genetic architecture of HSCR and has profound implications for future study designs.	 16557299 22574178 26432245 27321947 19521704 16632597 18245392 19306335 21074721 21374718 25056061 20679487 22125221 25839327 2309705 24086078 22820512 16963482 23104008 17572673 26559152 19196962 26544805 23785302 20616382 21376301 20460270 11641219 21283760 22949513 21706185 27535533 23406875 23715323 23400839 23454768 25834021 19812666 22955989 18832397 24743097 15829955 21167468 23707863 12631670 22589734 25660130 17965226 23372769 19666519 26657631 25310821 26863197
27694927	A genome-wide association study identifies risk loci for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 10q26.13 and 12q23.1.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown that common genetic variation contributes to the heritable risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To identify new susceptibility loci for the largest subtype of ALL, B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), we conducted a meta-analysis of two GWASs with imputation using 1000 Genomes and UK10K Project data as reference (totaling 1658 cases and 7224 controls). After genotyping an additional 2525 cases and 3575 controls, we identify new susceptibility loci for BCP-ALL mapping to 10q26.13 (rs35837782, LHPP, P=1.38 × 10	 23508010 24119843 17895893 17194218 16862161 12111919 23996088 7909357 26367797 21267062 20453839 18838613 22138821 22064851 22899827 19684604 21459794 21304890 18978787 15965027 26463672 17572673 19684571 12029063 22955616 21267061 17676998 23395119 22456626 26868379 20354512 18852200 12801912 10720126 16467884 23025517 5910392 22955989 24487276 20418889 17701901 20154213 9039726 25208325 26368830 26527286 21167468 22436535 26104880 19543373 11984562 16224025 24013639
27702941	Genome-wide association study of caffeine metabolites provides new insights to caffeine metabolism and dietary caffeine-consumption behavior.	Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world and presents with wide interindividual variation in metabolism. This variation may modify potential adverse or beneficial effects of caffeine on health. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma caffeine, paraxanthine, theophylline, theobromine and paraxanthine/caffeine ratio among up to 9,876 individuals of European ancestry from six population-based studies. A single SNP at 6p23 (near CD83) and several SNPs at 7p21 (near AHR), 15q24 (near CYP1A2) and 19q13.2 (near CYP2A6) met GW-significance (P < 5 × 10-8) and were associated with one or more metabolites. Variants at 7p21 and 15q24 associated with higher plasma caffeine and lower plasma paraxanthine/caffeine (slow caffeine metabolism) were previously associated with lower coffee and caffeine consumption behavior in GWAS. Variants at 19q13.2 associated with higher plasma paraxanthine/caffeine (slow paraxanthine metabolism) were also associated with lower coffee consumption in the UK Biobank (n = 94 343, P < 1.0 × 10-6). Variants at 2p24 (in GCKR), 4q22 (in ABCG2) and 7q11.23 (near POR) that were previously associated with coffee consumption in GWAS were nominally associated with plasma caffeine or its metabolites. Taken together, we have identified genetic factors contributing to variation in caffeine metabolism and confirm an important modulating role of systemic caffeine levels in dietary caffeine consumption behavior. Moreover, candidate genes identified encode proteins with important clinical functions that extend beyond caffeine metabolism.

In this study, we assessed the influence of host genetics on microbial species, pathways and gene ontology categories, on the basis of metagenomic sequencing in 1,514 subjects. In a genome-wide analysis, we identified associations of 9 loci with microbial taxonomies and 33 loci with microbial pathways and gene ontology terms at P < 5 × 10	
27701424	Novel Genetic Variants for Cartilage Thickness and Hip Osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis is one of the most frequent and disabling diseases of the elderly. Only few genetic variants have been identified for osteoarthritis, which is partly due to large phenotype heterogeneity. To reduce heterogeneity, we here examined cartilage thickness, one of the structural components of joint health. We conducted a genome-wide association study of minimal joint space width (mJSW), a proxy for cartilage thickness, in a discovery set of 13,013 participants from five different cohorts and replication in 8,227 individuals from seven independent cohorts. We identified five genome-wide significant (GWS, P≤5·0×10-8) SNPs annotated to four distinct loci. In addition, we found two additional loci that were significantly replicated, but results of combined meta-analysis fell just below the genome wide significance threshold. The four novel associated genetic loci were located in/near TGFA (rs2862851), PIK3R1 (rs10471753), SLBP/FGFR3 (rs2236995), and TREH/DDX6 (rs496547), while the other two (DOT1L and SUPT3H/RUNX2) were previously identified. A systematic prioritization for underlying causal genes was performed using diverse lines of evidence. Exome sequencing data (n = 2,050 individuals) indicated that there were no rare exonic variants that could explain the identified associations. In addition, TGFA, FGFR3 and PIK3R1 were differentially expressed in OA cartilage lesions versus non-lesioned cartilage in the same individuals. In conclusion, we identified four novel loci (TGFA, PIK3R1, FGFR3 and TREH) and confirmed two loci known to be associated with cartilage thickness.The identified associations were not caused by rare exonic variants. This is the first report linking TGFA to human OA, which may serve as a new target for future therapies.	 25378313 17968906 18974171 25693563 20499385 10722711 23203458 10913065 25597830 15479891 20048163 21383967 22064851 20944595 21059398 12045153 24625756 20881960 25282103 23505243 20616382 19198609 27130636 21505031 23810382 24604202 22504420 25054223 23563607 23193274 22763110 19838193 23263488 22575362 20634204 21177295 21737059 22171981 25064007 15146417 21167468 22951725 22955828 21068099 22566624 22917744 7612040 24013639
27723779	Genome-Wide Interaction Analyses between Genetic Variants and Alcohol Consumption and Smoking for Risk of Colorectal Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, variants in these loci explain only a small proportion of familial aggregation, and there are likely additional variants that are associated with CRC susceptibility. Genome-wide studies of gene-environment interactions may identify variants that are not detected in GWAS of marginal gene effects. To study this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis for interaction between genetic variants and alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking using data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Interactions were tested using logistic regression. We identified interaction between CRC risk and alcohol consumption and variants in the 9q22.32/HIATL1 (Pinteraction = 1.76×10-8; permuted p-value 3.51x10-8) region. Compared to non-/occasional drinking light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs9409565 CT genotype (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74-0.91]; P = 2.1×10-4) and TT genotypes (OR,0.62 [95% CI, 0.51-0.75]; P = 1.3×10-6) but not associated among those with the CC genotype (p = 0.059). No genome-wide statistically significant interactions were observed for smoking. If replicated our suggestive finding of a genome-wide significant interaction between genetic variants and alcohol consumption might contribute to understanding colorectal cancer etiology and identifying subpopulations with differential susceptibility to the effect of alcohol on CRC risk.	 20304247 21630275 14388528 23297738 9525528 16862161 6386716 17701906 26965516 8122051 17982118 21036793 23001243 19022827 2151680 16255080 26404086 19812304 21769935 23873611 15096331 22367214 2248624 21139605 19333237 22595851 21097893 10891514 24334570 18300295 20510678 22690667 21059681 26187503 23109555 21186191 18200594 24313162 19434079 22714933 17615082 26237130 16415888 21157483 23307060 22499810 20052679 23266556 19963289 20502693 8801636 24415611 24225001 25152454 26151821 8861899 23715323 25427900 21307158 19088354 11752295 20711421 23126574 21044875 22094952 17554300 21536930 22426492 20212493 19142968 21761138 18200600 20937634 24123198 18348202 14648711 17591622 18162111 20702402 22294761 25573590 18846210 8785668 23821317
27723809	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies ZNF354C Variants Associated with Depression from Interferon-Based Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C.	The therapeutic use of interferon (IFN) is known to cause depression that frequently interrupts treatment. To identify genetic variants associated with IFN-induced depression, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 224 Japanese chronic hepatitis C patients receiving IFN-based therapy in a multicenter prospective study and stratified them into two groups according to the Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II) score. In the GWAS stage, we selected 42 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to perform replication analysis in an independent set of 160 subjects. The SNP rs1863918 in strong linkage disequilibrium with SNPs located around the Zinc finger 354C (ZNF354C) gene on chromosome 5 showed a significant association when the results of GWAS and replication were combined (odds ratio = 2.55, P = 7.89×10-8 in the allele frequency model), suggesting that the rs1863918 T allele was associated with IFN-induced depression. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that rs1863918 T allele, a history of depression, and younger age were independent predictive factors for IFN-induced depression. Interestingly, western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that ZNF354C was highly expressed in the hippocampus in mice, a region implicated in the pathology of psychiatric symptoms. In conclusion, we identified rs1863918 as significantly associated with IFN-induced depression, and revealed that the candidate gene ZNF354C is highly expressed in the hippocampus of mice. Our data might be useful for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of depression induced by drugs including IFN.	 15669887 12436197 23031785 10831463 22176275 21161299 24907225 10786630 16427157 18458677 17359929 20670830 12127479 8991972 15373769 12407599 15990456 15694227 24856827 19749757 18801474 18426262 25068123 26648100 17408646 18817904 12070276 21987462 17384421 23525215 25288875 12324553 19272410 11278774 19543373 14960528 22681168 8775763 9122202 17929299

27758888	Genetic Polymorphisms in the Long Noncoding RNA MIR2052HG Offer a Pharmacogenomic Basis for the Response of Breast Cancer Patients to Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy.	Genetic risks in breast cancer remain only partly understood. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study of germline DNA from 4,658 women, including 252 women experiencing a breast cancer recurrence, who were entered on the MA.27 adjuvant trial comparing the aromatase inhibitors (AI) anastrozole and exemestane. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of top significance were identified in the gene encoding MIR2052HG, a long noncoding RNA of unknown function. Heterozygous or homozygous individuals for variant alleles exhibited a ∼40% or ∼63% decrease, respectively, in the hazard of breast cancer recurrence relative to homozygous wild-type individuals. Functional genomic studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines and ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines showed that expression from MIR2052HG and the ESR1 gene encoding estrogen receptor-α (ERα) was induced by estrogen and AI in a SNP-dependent manner. Variant SNP genotypes exhibited increased ERα binding to estrogen response elements, relative to wild-type genotypes, a pattern that was reversed by AI treatment. Further, variant SNPs were associated with lower expression of MIR2052HG and ERα. RNAi-mediated silencing of MIR2052HG in breast cancer cell lines decreased ERα expression, cell proliferation, and anchorage-independent colony formation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MIR2052HG sustained ERα levels both by promoting AKT/FOXO3-mediated ESR1 transcription and by limiting ubiquitin-mediated, proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα. Taken together, our results define MIR2052HS as a functionally polymorphic gene that affects risks of breast cancer recurrence in women treated with AI. More broadly, our results offer a pharmacogenomic basis to understand differences in the response of breast cancer patients to AI therapy.

Birth weight (BW) has been shown to be influenced by both fetal and maternal factors and in observational studies is reproducibly associated with future risk of adult metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. These life-course associations have often been attributed to the impact of an adverse early life environment. Here, we performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of BW in 153,781 individuals, identifying 60 loci where fetal genotype was associated with BW (P < 5 × 10	 24958438 16135132 11315092 24846176 16862161 26367797 20562875 9662401 23128226 20485568 25642630 17943122 22685416 22125221 14672738 24037378 22064851 25043035 25352553 25078964 22820512 24316576 18462017 17786212 21307141 17344885 22955616 25282103 25518859 23209423 20616382 24336895 22955987 24702953 26902494 24907074 20354512 23202125 20517342 23575227 26414676 25592586 24553384 20811451 23406875 19862010 24604202 3500022 24509480 15702667 25642633 21151130 25060210 19380612 26284790 26978208 22100073 24762786 20509871 24296717 17701901 19561590 21778739 23202124 10348008 23104008 25640676 22426310 17873874 20714348 21909115 25673413 22885922 21283786 25953952 25501874 20220756 24013639 25954001 20208533
27736895	Variant Discovery and Fine Mapping of Genetic Loci Associated with Blood Pressure Traits in Hispanics and African Americans.	Despite the substantial burden of hypertension in US minority populations, few genetic studies of blood pressure have been conducted in Hispanics and African Americans, and it is unclear whether many of the established loci identified in European-descent populations contribute to blood pressure variation in non-European descent populations. Using the Metabochip array, we sought to characterize the genetic architecture of previously identified blood pressure loci, and identify novel cardiometabolic variants related to systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a multi-ethnic US population including Hispanics (n = 19,706) and African Americans (n = 18,744). Several known blood pressure loci replicated in African Americans and Hispanics. Fourteen variants in three loci (KCNK3, FGF5, ATXN2-SH2B3) were significantly associated with blood pressure in Hispanics. The most significant diastolic blood pressure variant identified in our analysis, rs2586886/KCNK3 (P = 5.2 x 10-9), also replicated in independent Hispanic and European-descent samples. African American and trans-ethnic meta-analysis data identified novel variants in the FGF5, ULK4 and HOXA-EVX1 loci, which have not been previously associated with blood pressure traits. Our identification and independent replication of variants in KCNK3, a gene implicated in primary hyperaldosteronism, as well as a variant in HOTTIP (HOXA-EVX1) suggest that further work to clarify the roles of these genes may be warranted. Overall, our findings suggest that loci identified in European descent populations also contribute to blood pressure variation in diverse populations including Hispanics and African Americans-populations that are understudied for hypertension genetic risk factors.	 24390345 21836165 18250325 11799070 22876189 27296998 11452081 24627442 23245609 12719445 20727787 22851474 23972371 21909110 21572416 21565292 19430479 18034154 20089546 25480034 12507787 24975945 12851274 24560520 22051427 22479213 26139635 19430483 21378095 22539988 26390057 19396169 21909115 12748199 11590548 14614392 18823665 23303523
27764800	GWAS in the SIGNAL/PHARE clinical cohort restricts the association between the FGFR2 locus and estrogen receptor status to HER2-negative breast cancer patients.	Genetic polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer risk. Clinical and epidemiological observations suggest that clinical characteristics of breast cancer, such as estrogen receptor or HER2 status, are also influenced by hereditary factors. To identify genetic variants associated with pathological characteristics of breast cancer patients, a Genome Wide Association Study was performed in a cohort of 9365 women from the French nationwide SIGNAL/PHARE studies (NCT00381901/RECF1098). Strong association between the FGFR2 locus and ER status of breast cancer patients was observed (ER-positive n=6211, ER-negative n=2516; rs3135718 OR=1.34 p=5.46×10-12). This association was limited to patients with HER2-negative tumors (ER-positive n=4267, ER-negative n=1185; rs3135724 OR=1.85 p=1.16×10-11). The FGFR2 locus is known to be associated with breast cancer risk. This study provides sound evidence for an association between variants in the FGFR2 locus and ER status among breast cancer patients, particularly among patients with HER2-negative disease. This refinement of the association between FGFR2 variants and ER-status to HER2-negative disease provides novel insight to potential biological and clinical influence of genetic polymorphisms on breast tumors.	 22461340 23764181 19434714 17529967 22976474 21844186 22331459 23143756 17529973 20233392 23535733 21852249 22859399 21596841 24290378 24325915 25751625 22037553

27890468	Genetic Overlap Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Bipolar Disorder: Evidence From Genome-wide Association Study Meta-analysis.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are frequently co-occurring and highly heritable mental health conditions. We hypothesized that BPD cases with an early age of onset (≤21 years old) would be particularly likely to show genetic covariation with ADHD.	
27980656	Genome-wide association of trajectories of systolic blood pressure change.	There is great interindividual variation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a result of the influences of several factors, including sex, ancestry, smoking status, medication use, and, especially, age. The majority of genetic studies have examined SBP measured cross-sectionally; however, SBP changes over time, and not necessarily in a linear fashion. Therefore, this study conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study of SBP change trajectories using data available through the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 (GAW19) of 959 individuals from 20 extended Mexican American families from the San Antonio Family Studies with up to 4 measures of SBP. We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) while taking into account potential genetic effects to identify how, if at all, to include covariates in estimating the SBP change trajectories using a mixture model based latent class growth modeling (LCGM) approach for use in the GWA analyses.	 25519398 16862161 23502345 21996601 24379826 24165912 11040222 23972371 21572416 19430479 22935194 21519539 16152135 2320703 25519314 25413659 9545414 10423121 19430483 24058526 25519409 25219520 25109877

27797806	Genome-wide association study in essential tremor identifies three new loci.	We conducted a genome-wide association study of essential tremor, a common movement disorder characterized mainly by a postural and kinetic tremor of the upper extremities. Twin and family history studies show a high heritability for essential tremor. The molecular genetic determinants of essential tremor are unknown. We included 2807 patients and 6441 controls of European descent in our two-stage genome-wide association study. The 59 most significantly disease-associated markers of the discovery stage were genotyped in the replication stage. After Bonferroni correction two markers, one (rs10937625) located in the serine/threonine kinase STK32B and one (rs17590046) in the transcriptional coactivator PPARGC1A were associated with essential tremor. Three markers (rs12764057, rs10822974, rs7903491) in the cell-adhesion molecule CTNNA3 were significant in the combined analysis of both stages. The expression of STK32B was increased in the cerebellar cortex of patients and expression quantitative trait loci database mining showed association between the protective minor allele of rs10937625 and reduced expression in cerebellar cortex. We found no expression differences related to disease status or marker genotype for the other two genes. Replication of two lead single nucleotide polymorphisms of previous small genome-wide association studies (rs3794087 in SLC1A2, rs9652490 in LINGO1) did not confirm the association with essential tremor.	 17761686 15037695 17055784 21085122 21244579 16490960 22764253 16032514 24532269 19182806 21436230 20175185 23652425 10412986 9827589 18454448 17701901 21848658 22706312
27764096	A Large Genome-Wide Association Study of Age-Related Hearing Impairment Using Electronic Health Records.	Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI), one of the most common sensory disorders, can be mitigated, but not cured or eliminated. To identify genetic influences underlying ARHI, we conducted a genome-wide association study of ARHI in 6,527 cases and 45,882 controls among the non-Hispanic whites from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We identified two novel genome-wide significant SNPs: rs4932196 (odds ratio = 1.185, p = 4.0x10-11), 52Kb 3' of ISG20, which replicated in a meta-analysis of the other GERA race/ethnicity groups (1,025 cases, 12,388 controls, p = 0.00094) and in a UK Biobank case-control analysis (30,802 self-reported cases, 78,586 controls, p = 0.015); and rs58389158 (odds ratio = 1.132, p = 1.8x10-9), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00021). The latter SNP lies just outside exon 8 and is highly correlated (r2 = 0.96) with the missense SNP rs5756795 in exon 7 of TRIOBP, a gene previously associated with prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss. We further tested these SNPs in phenotypes from audiologist notes available on a subset of GERA (4,903 individuals), stratified by case/control status, to construct an independent replication test, and found a significant effect of rs58389158 on speech reception threshold (SRT; overall GERA meta-analysis p = 1.9x10-6). We also tested variants within exons of 132 other previously-identified hearing loss genes, and identified two common additional significant SNPs: rs2877561 (synonymous change in ILDR1, p = 6.2x10-5), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00057), and had a significant GERA SRT (p = 0.00019) and speech discrimination score (SDS; p = 0.0019); and rs9493627 (missense change in EYA4, p = 0.00011) which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.0095), other GERA groups (p = 0.0080), and had a consistent significant result for SRT (p = 0.041) and suggestive result for SDS (p = 0.081). Large cohorts with GWAS data and electronic health records may be a useful method to characterize the genetic architecture of ARHI.	 19237727 11159937 11315092 21255762 18663164 22384356 23838599 16385457 11890591 22138821 14570962 23334578 22064851 17430434 21493956 26209310 15965027 23315928 26092718 22820512 9099560 26092716 19047183 19684571 19853241 16182900 25722852 21376301 24853665 10713509 20517342 24939585 25761183 18271029 12437862 25122905 17664866 20068591 24487276 25826379 23226338 16385458 21167468 21565264 22243964 25904789 15641023 20926424 4843792 19543373 21903159 14656959 16481444 25954001
27770449	Polymorphic variation in TPMT is the principal determinant of TPMT phenotype: A meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies.	Thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel diseases has been linked to genetically defined variability in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. While gene testing of TPMT is being clinically implemented, it is unclear if additional genetic variation influences TPMT activity with consequences for thiopurine-related toxicity. To examine this possibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of red blood cell TPMT activity in 844 Estonian individuals and 245 pediatric ALL cases. Additionally, we correlated genome-wide genotypes to human hepatic TPMT activity in 123 samples. Only genetic variants mapping to chromosome 6, including the TPMT gene region, were significantly associated with TPMT activity (P < 5.0 × 10	 22846425 21104887 12542916 26033531 19535798 26239079 23996088 16220112 10580024 12819840 17304143 23407052 26876431 23252716 19109566 24624911 15784872 3344216 17572673 26878724 25303295 17701890 19591196 10833476 25108385 11736862 24896764 21412232 19925429 12835738 24518929 17329987 22006096 15226673 27774042 20509871 20634204 18687736 19945438 23422873 26072396 17328579 16691038 26465987
27777418	The PHF21B gene is associated with major depression and modulates the stress response.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects around 350 million people worldwide; however, the underlying genetic basis remains largely unknown. In this study, we took into account that MDD is a gene-environment disorder, in which stress is a critical component, and used whole-genome screening of functional variants to investigate the 'missing heritability' in MDD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effect models were performed in a Los Angeles Mexican-American cohort (196 controls, 203 MDD) and in a replication European-ancestry cohort (499 controls, 473 MDD). Our analyses took into consideration the stress levels in the control populations. The Mexican-American controls, comprised primarily of recent immigrants, had high levels of stress due to acculturation issues and the European-ancestry controls with high stress levels were given higher weights in our analysis. We identified 44 common and rare functional variants associated with mild to moderate MDD in the Mexican-American cohort (genome-wide false discovery rate, FDR, <0.05), and their pathway analysis revealed that the three top overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) processes were innate immune response, glutamate receptor signaling and detection of chemical stimulus in smell sensory perception. Rare variant analysis replicated the association of the PHF21B gene in the ethnically unrelated European-ancestry cohort. The TRPM2 gene, previously implicated in mood disorders, may also be considered replicated by our analyses. Whole-genome sequencing analyses of a subset of the cohorts revealed that European-ancestry individuals have a significantly reduced (50%) number of single nucleotide variants compared with Mexican-American individuals, and for this reason the role of rare variants may vary across populations. PHF21b variants contribute significantly to differences in the levels of expression of this gene in several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Furthermore, using an animal model of stress, we found that Phf21b hippocampal gene expression is significantly decreased in animals resilient to chronic restraint stress when compared with non-chronically stressed animals. Together, our results reveal that including stress level data enables the identification of novel rare functional variants associated with MDD.	 24879990 24445907 19844206 25174004 20385823 16077682 8215812 22223662 23128226 22706313 12184808 21903627 25220861 15040578 15939839 18509313 19269692 18636631 25454821 26569330 26008736 22449891 23999526 27502476 24505129 17173049 19684571 21135853 26176920 27431295 19505943 22019604 26803500 20676075 24016317 15225876 11404818 17248194 15196796 21129725 20354512 22194699 15127793 11328886 20811451 16442080 22670140 18504423 21152010 22777127 8279933 22687339 22472876 15925697 22913985 15520370 16205735 20976247 9809543 16390897 20080115 17687328 12032298 19451168 11007705 12824425 20976246 11331918 19439607 20601685 15655562 27479909 11566143 23511475
26503814	A genome-wide analysis of the response to inhaled β2-agonists in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Short-acting β2-agonist bronchodilators are the most common medications used in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Genetic variants determining bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) in COPD have not been identified. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BDR in 5789 current or former smokers with COPD in one African-American and four white populations. BDR was defined as the quantitative spirometric response to inhaled β2-agonists. We combined results in a meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes KCNK1 (P=2.02 × 10(-7)) and KCNJ2 (P=1.79 × 10(-7)) were the top associations with BDR. Among African Americans, SNPs in CDH13 were significantly associated with BDR (P=5.1 × 10(-9)). A nominal association with CDH13 was identified in a gene-based analysis in all subjects. We identified suggestive association with BDR among COPD subjects for variants near two potassium channel genes (KCNK1 and KCNJ2). SNPs in CDH13 were significantly associated with BDR in African Americans.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 27 October 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.65.	 23992748 22212731 22383665 17194218 20835239 15210937 18256071 22792082 11862989 11867346 22080838 12832670 23284291 24441871 19033363 23777323 8943294 22793939 22696176 20616382 16890763 20136362 23508266 20598278 17890463 19300482 12719384 25514360 21294785 22815927 17993586 17701901 9354814 17507545 19111454 20173748 20851928 20010835 19131956 2553974 24461901 12885978 10502653 21964404 18303970 20214461 18216052 24418963
27798627	Genome-wide analysis identifies 12 loci influencing human reproductive behavior.	The genetic architecture of human reproductive behavior-age at first birth (AFB) and number of children ever born (NEB)-has a strong relationship with fitness, human development, infertility and risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, very few genetic loci have been identified, and the underlying mechanisms of AFB and NEB are poorly understood. We report a large genome-wide association study of both sexes including 251,151 individuals for AFB and 343,072 individuals for NEB. We identified 12 independent loci that are significantly associated with AFB and/or NEB in a SNP-based genome-wide association study and 4 additional loci associated in a gene-based effort. These loci harbor genes that are likely to have a role, either directly or by affecting non-local gene expression, in human reproduction and infertility, thereby increasing understanding of these complex traits.	 25526766 3145193 26051285 25118846 22665492 25693563 19474294 23271957 11399746 16024815 20926419 16862161 23132118 16728718 27918535 12111373 23440941 15964893 25597830 12888280 26438539 27007234 23080372 25642630 25550326 18508807 24105416 16107712 27089180 9045873 25752597 19465376 7954814 17376819 25231870 20586553 23935508 21652599 20881960 4076479 21712390 22955616 25282103 23307926 25260699 26757598 25518859 24453072 21102462 20616382 24395754 25201988 26414676 16494531 18451988 20598278 26234944 27225129 26416764 26039877 26672804 25683123 24762786 24676469 22955989 12710997 20961180 26412877 17701901 24890860 23404848 23703204 18622426 24097068 25506236 25673413 19571811 18613948 10802651 15499007 26414677 21826657 20586096 21086038 15531880 24706793 21900684 26370665 27089181

27723757	Genome-wide association studies of autoimmune vitiligo identify 23 new risk loci and highlight key pathways and regulatory variants.	Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which depigmented skin results from the destruction of melanocytes, with epidemiological association with other autoimmune diseases. In previous linkage and genome-wide association studies (GWAS1 and GWAS2), we identified 27 vitiligo susceptibility loci in patients of European ancestry. We carried out a third GWAS (GWAS3) in European-ancestry subjects, with augmented GWAS1 and GWAS2 controls, genome-wide imputation, and meta-analysis of all three GWAS, followed by an independent replication. The combined analyses, with 4,680 cases and 39,586 controls, identified 23 new significantly associated loci and 7 suggestive loci. Most encode immune and apoptotic regulators, with some also associated with other autoimmune diseases, as well as several melanocyte regulators. Bioinformatic analyses indicate a predominance of causal regulatory variation, some of which corresponds to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at these loci. Together, the identified genes provide a framework for the genetic architecture and pathobiology of vitiligo, highlight relationships with other autoimmune diseases and melanoma, and offer potential targets for treatment.	 26426330 20526340 25242557 11286727 17250545 23201126 21151127 24837172 16862161 12111919 23273568 19455578 24311363 19427863 23321921 17210792 21841780 9450927 24097066 25963972 21829393 25479423 25439723 25352553 19340012 20190752 25473424 22402439 23001997 24830394 20596022 19696312 26337759 25605840 22493691 26057447 23053960 17377159 23136900 20369019 12958120 12753387 21102463 7534620 8910377 19503088 24604202 25643325 20182347 24614317 26414678 26787888 25631878 20959028 24267888 19838193 25743184 26578592 21646343 17701901 26258848 26787886 23173110 23834318 20410501 22561518 16029422 24753594
27454463	Genome-wide association analysis of pain severity in dysmenorrhea identifies association at chromosome 1p13.2, near the nerve growth factor locus.	Dysmenorrhea is a common chronic pelvic pain syndrome affecting women of childbearing potential. Family studies suggest that genetic background influences the severity of dysmenorrhea, but genetic predisposition and molecular mechanisms underlying dysmenorrhea are not understood. In this study, we conduct the first genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with dysmenorrhea pain severity. A cohort of females of European descent (n = 11,891) aged 18 to 45 years rated their average dysmenorrhea pain severity. We used a linear regression model adjusting for age and body mass index, identifying one genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10) association (rs7523086, P = 4.1 × 10, effect size 0.1 [95% confidence interval, 0.074-0.126]). This single nucleotide polymorphism is colocalising with NGF, encoding nerve growth factor. The presence of one risk allele corresponds to a predicted 0.1-point increase in pain intensity on a 4-point ordinal pain scale. The putative effects on NGF function and/or expression remain unknown. However, genetic variation colocalises with active epigenetic marks in fat and ovary tissues, and expression levels in aorta tissue of a noncoding RNA flanking NGF correlate. Participants reporting extreme dysmenorrhea pain were more likely to report being positive for endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. Our results indicate that dysmenorrhea pain severity is partly genetically determined. NGF already has an established role in chronic pain disorders, and our findings suggest that NGF may be an important mediator for gynaecological/pelvic pain in the viscera.	 10617260 21208343 16430896 21858135 20482429 16552294 8294522 8422075 15008771 15045780 15544981 26484569 18673099 2390501 3297513 18448607 22446693 25059384 23883529 21524851 7918820 22064851 15939839 16401692 20585627 18514997 17350675 5059589 20929038 15958429 25690853 23727940 9163765 17610451 21199306 21420111 23104006 26176920 26346058 18372219 15134424 16815322 26218569 8917003 7137249 16489934 8532266 15877314 24163697 19237109 20844546 19231607 16287008 19944416 15181052 17125422 8857635 23693160 23715323 25383981 23472165 23028238 21151130 1416778 24284871 22472876 11212080 23545214 23982303 20159173 20601957 21106492 15050982 20634204 10465224 25500343 20074018 9308868 8515321 16690671 24379699 18803452 16172113 11115307 25296917 18537489 3380425 21888965 26390831 10902790 21439576 26657631 17720026 10202882 25954001 11714182 26576710
27668658	Discovery and refinement of genetic loci associated with cardiometabolic risk using dense imputation maps.	Large-scale whole-genome sequence data sets offer novel opportunities to identify genetic variation underlying human traits. Here we apply genotype imputation based on whole-genome sequence data from the UK10K and 1000 Genomes Project into 35,981 study participants of European ancestry, followed by association analysis with 20 quantitative cardiometabolic and hematological traits. We describe 17 new associations, including 6 rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%) or low-frequency (1% < MAF < 5%) variants with platelet count (PLT), red blood cell indices (MCH and MCV) and HDL cholesterol. Applying fine-mapping analysis to 233 known and new loci associated with the 20 traits, we resolve the associations of 59 loci to credible sets of 20 or fewer variants and describe trait enrichments within regions of predicted regulatory function. These findings improve understanding of the allelic architecture of risk factors for cardiometabolic and hematological diseases and provide additional functional insights with the identification of potentially novel biological targets.	 26517924 23927492 25104515 22507743 22855609 24119843 25693563 24097068 20128661 22398613 24895164 25948564 24097064 26367797 22929040 24777453 23508304 24974849 22138821 26366553 24037378 20657596 23402219 25569183 26324256 24507774 22955617 24325358 22820512 25437874 26773131 15492236 20686565 20700443 25147438 22955616 22139419 9694695 10583217 23263489 16249236 22797727 18842065 21653522 25961943 23484830 12807892 9425899 26075791 18367486 26438538 27486782 23263486 25743335 22399799 25225788 9063752 19147982 24464100 20509871 23292738 15459198 25305756 23104008 23222517 26368830 24497850 9679061 18642345 26447191 15297675 22589082 22885922 26502339 22394675 23103231 24085763 23041383 25096241 24013639 25954001

Hair straightness/curliness is one of the most conspicuous features of human variation and is particularly diverse among populations. A recent genome-wide scan found common variants in the Trichohyalin (TCHH) gene that are associated with hair straightness in Europeans, but different genes might affect this phenotype in other populations. By sampling 2899 Han Chinese, we performed the first genome-wide scan of hair straightness in East Asians, and found EDAR (rs3827760) as the predominant gene (P = 4.67 × 10	 17919196 23731540 16862161 12111919 19803779 20562875 20585627 18065779 23793515 21565292 21564903 26061380 22402612 20616382 20517342 20056855 16494531 19896111 19543370 23415220 17919197 26926045 20634204 17701901 24743097 21167468 25242497 12397357 19543373 21541012 18561327
27790247	Pleiotropic Meta-Analyses of Longitudinal Studies Discover Novel Genetic Variants Associated with Age-Related Diseases.	Age-related diseases may result from shared biological mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging. Genetic effects on age-related diseases are often modulated by environmental factors due to their little contribution to fitness or are mediated through certain endophenotypes. Identification of genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on both common complex diseases and endophenotypes may reveal potential conflicting evolutionary pressures and deliver new insights into shared genetic contribution to healthspan and lifespan. Here, we performed pleiotropic meta-analyses of genetic variants using five NIH-funded datasets by integrating univariate summary statistics for age-related diseases and endophenotypes. We investigated three groups of traits: (1) endophenotypes such as blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, hematocrit, and body mass index, (2) time-to-event outcomes such as the age-at-onset of diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and (3) both combined. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identify seven novel genome-wide significant loci (< 5e-08), out of which five are low-frequency variants. Specifically, from Group 2, we find rs7632505 on 3q21.1 in 	 19387120 18400689 20018020 21072364 18974171 22303408 11530097 18162531 24671021 11102749 10666036 17372189 15014499 23035388 22567092 10819331 23869080 12370315 16380915 20300519 14622657 22064851 11788960 2646917 26702037 23752797 25500260 16708071 1342297 26295473 23768105 21885020 24447677 11290731 22102272 8817451 23408289 22077970 22955616 26829209 10807470 22139419 12397006 24497847 25918517 23478338 24931982 21842266 6534410 23359524 25940136 16807484 24969630 21467542 17554260 12925518 19914276 22781427 18587394 22424433 23635324 26042666 14500287 24786325 17826176 24121476 23925498 24675618 20197094 25010335 21211618 8989520 19966301 19010253 17701901 26785476 19750006 24465924 21669876 24430186 17616525 22916079 18240544 10500044 22544168 22539758 10955408 25482294 18272466 20562413 15749041 16172288 23708190 21441907 19543373 23636237 18385810 24023716 24607388
27818178	Molecular Genetic Contributions to Social Deprivation and Household Income in UK Biobank.	Individuals with lower socio-economic status (SES) are at increased risk of physical and mental illnesses and tend to die at an earlier age [1-3]. Explanations for the association between SES and health typically focus on factors that are environmental in origin [4]. However, common SNPs have been found collectively to explain around 18% of the phenotypic variance of an area-based social deprivation measure of SES [5]. Molecular genetic studies have also shown that common physical and psychiatric diseases are partly heritable [6]. It is possible that phenotypic associations between SES and health arise partly due to a shared genetic etiology. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on social deprivation and on household income using 112,151 participants of UK Biobank. We find that common SNPs explain 21% of the variation in social deprivation and 11% of household income. Two independent loci attained genome-wide significance for household income, with the most significant SNP in each of these loci being rs187848990 on chromosome 2 and rs8100891 on chromosome 19. Genes in the regions of these SNPs have been associated with intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, and synaptic plasticity. Extensive genetic correlations were found between both measures of SES and illnesses, anthropometric variables, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive ability. These findings suggest that some SNPs associated with SES are involved in the brain and central nervous system. The genetic associations with SES obviously do not reflect direct causal effects and are probably mediated via other partly heritable variables, including cognitive ability, personality, and health.	 1674771 25985137 11154256 24418307 7804049 17014726 26476593 22521361 23752797 22786799 25885710 26866486 9478973 16452104 21330300 26809841 26414676 24944428 27225129 26414678 25826379 17701901 21167468 15564276 25778476 27046643

27846281	Meta-GWAS and Meta-Analysis of Exome Array Studies Do Not Reveal Genetic Determinants of Serum Hepcidin.	Serum hepcidin concentration is regulated by iron status, inflammation, erythropoiesis and numerous other factors, but underlying processes are incompletely understood. We studied the association of common and rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with serum hepcidin in one Italian study and two large Dutch population-based studies. We genotyped common SNVs with genome-wide association study (GWAS) arrays and subsequently performed imputation using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Cohort-specific GWAS were performed for log-transformed serum hepcidin, adjusted for age and gender, and results were combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (total N 6,096). Six top SNVs (p<5x10-6) were genotyped in 3,821 additional samples, but associations were not replicated. Furthermore, we meta-analyzed cohort-specific exome array association results of rare SNVs with serum hepcidin that were available for two of the three cohorts (total N 3,226), but no exome-wide significant signal (p<1.4x10-6) was identified. Gene-based meta-analyses revealed 19 genes that showed significant association with hepcidin. Our results suggest the absence of common SNVs and rare exonic SNVs explaining a large proportion of phenotypic variation in serum hepcidin. We recommend extension of our study once additional substantial cohorts with hepcidin measurements, GWAS and/or exome array data become available in order to increase power to identify variants that explain a smaller proportion of hepcidin variation. In addition, we encourage follow-up of the potentially interesting genes that resulted from the gene-based analysis of low-frequency and rare variants.	 19387120 19820699 15486069 25352340 25597830 17012270 22713810 12606179 21255436 24137020 15478097 19084217 21527524 19341701 16254196 23232066 18689548 21208937 25518859 21785125 24478790 20616382 21943158 18557745 12547226 14871914 20598278 20603012 12356629 16627556 17435114 23512844 27044621 19880490 22752055 23794717 20454541 22843986 20878249 23824729 23817569 19847309 19503614 24336170 18408718 20739637 21873547 22706312 11855950 15514116
28171582	Genome-wide association study identifies WNT7B as a novel locus for central corneal thickness in Latinos.	The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye and is a vital component of focusing incoming light on the retina. Central corneal thickness (CCT) is now recognized to have a significant role in ocular health and is a risk factor for various ocular diseases, such as keratoconus and primary open angle glaucoma. Most previous genetic studies utilized European and Asian subjects to identify genetic loci associated with CCT. Minority populations, such as Latinos, may aid in identifying additional loci and improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of CCT. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Latinos, a traditionally understudied population in genetic research, to further identify loci contributing to CCT. Study participants were genotyped using either the Illumina OmniExpress BeadChip (∼730K markers) or the Illumina Hispanic/SOL BeadChip (∼2.5 million markers). All study participants were 40 years of age and older. We assessed the association between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CCT using linear regression, adjusting for age, gender and principal components of genetic ancestry. To expand genomic coverage and to interrogate additional SNPs, we imputed SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project reference panels. We identified a novel SNP, rs10453441 (P = 6.01E-09), in an intron of WNT7B that is associated with CCT. Furthermore, WNT7B is expressed in the human cornea. We also replicated 11 previously reported loci, including IBTK, RXRA-COL5A1, COL5A1, FOXO1, LRRK1 and ZNF469 (P < 1.25E-3). These findings provide further insight into the genetic architecture of CCT and illustrate that the use of minority groups in GWAS will help identify additional loci.	 15582076 20719862 11315092 17503334 21284035 23703215 17194218 23291589 19434714 9535620 20537579 23128226 21984434 22796305 21254223 19714363 23493294 22661486 19556215 22814818 17070596 22754564 15557433 12049575 580329 21246217 12742348 11867360 16505019 11782049 20616382 25722852 17197527 17629563 20485516 19140131 16186354 21098505 23642083 10752942 18271029 19122826 25653097 15802269 20634204 12657586 16168081 15326116 25823570 19299220 22863193 12583791 17628686 21357396 15288969 29847655
27863252	The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease.	Many common variants have been associated with hematological traits, but identification of causal genes and pathways has proven challenging. We performed a genome-wide association analysis in the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies, testing 29.5 million genetic variants for association with 36 red cell, white cell, and platelet properties in 173,480 European-ancestry participants. This effort yielded hundreds of low frequency (<5%) and rare (<1%) variants with a strong impact on blood cell phenotypes. Our data highlight general properties of the allelic architecture of complex traits, including the proportion of the heritable component of each blood trait explained by the polygenic signal across different genome regulatory domains. Finally, through Mendelian randomization, we provide evidence of shared genetic pathways linking blood cell indices with complex pathologies, including autoimmune diseases, schizophrenia, and coronary heart disease and evidence suggesting previously reported population associations between blood cell indices and cardiovascular disease may be non-causal.	 26541609 12475459 25693563 19474294 26432245 21833088 27270105 24075749 25017904 22384356 26367797 23593036 25230735 22604720 24471821 27399967 11788929 27318201 24077912 25722984 9354683 23103226 10731151 24316577 11125122 18384481 24413527 19064721 11196644 26805783 22139419 18443023 24413732 26423011 20616382 25722852 24931982 27268795 26814963 19837879 25439729 20811451 27694958 27668658 22607825 27019110 26582918 25680891 20976133 25642633 27486782 18836590 22306005 26414678 25949529 23495356 15858186 25651729 27346686 26924528 27259154 25826379 23916372 27095789 23590652 24676807 24609760 23269371 23222517 27346689 27346685 25632051 1912571 23062357 16007086 27347004 22373907 25307146 25861979 24718290 24619621 26050253 27432187 23868113 26791950 15662028 19190246 25954001 26627738 24758382 15288155
28031287	Genome-wide quantitative trait loci mapping of the human cerebrospinal fluid proteome.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is virtually the only one accessible source of proteins derived from the central nervous system (CNS) of living humans and possibly reflects the pathophysiology of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, little is known regarding the genetic basis of variation in protein levels of human CSF. We examined CSF levels of 1,126 proteins in 133 subjects and performed a genome-wide association analysis of 514,227 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). To be conservative, Spearman's correlation was used to identify an association between genotypes of SNPs and protein levels. A total of 421 cis and 25 trans SNP-protein pairs were significantly correlated at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01 (nominal P < 7.66 × 10-9). Cis-only analysis revealed additional 580 SNP-protein pairs with FDR < 0.01 (nominal P < 2.13 × 10-5). pQTL SNPs were more likely, compared to non-pQTL SNPs, to be a disease/trait-associated variants identified by previous genome-wide association studies. The present findings suggest that genetic variations play an important role in the regulation of protein expression in the CNS. The obtained database may serve as a valuable resource to understand the genetic bases for CNS protein expression pattern in humans.

27918536	Genome-wide analyses for personality traits identify six genomic loci and show correlations with psychiatric disorders.	Personality is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and associated with mental health. However, the underlying genetic determinants are largely unknown. We identified six genetic loci, including five novel loci, significantly associated with personality traits in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (N = 123,132-260,861). Of these genome-wide significant loci, extraversion was associated with variants in WSCD2 and near PCDH15, and neuroticism with variants on chromosome 8p23.1 and in L3MBTL2. We performed a principal component analysis to extract major dimensions underlying genetic variations among five personality traits and six psychiatric disorders (N = 5,422-18,759). The first genetic dimension separated personality traits and psychiatric disorders, except that neuroticism and openness to experience were clustered with the disorders. High genetic correlations were found between extraversion and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and between openness and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The second genetic dimension was closely aligned with extraversion-introversion and grouped neuroticism with internalizing psychopathology (e.g., depression or anxiety).	 19204725 25961374 21134316 11315092 12930761 25257093 26362575 21926972 25807286 25056061 25642630 25993607 21618601 15625199 25607358 24294198 24830394 25006969 16648327 24174888 22509285 22820512 5470377 26714184 19859063 24828478 24829119 11039572 22365631 19748081 27067015 23903073 20616382 25201988 26053403 23453885 11192983 26808560 26835600 26414676 21173776 26854805 23437286 19732485 19875103 27182965 22472876 24415821 24695403 17924348 20634204 17701901 20595427 11513380 21848658 22426310 20981092 24514567 8427480 26171985 27089181

27922604	Common variants on 2p16.1, 6p22.1 and 10q24.32 are associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.	Many schizophrenia susceptibility loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European populations. However, until recently, schizophrenia GWASs in non-European populations were limited to small sample sizes and have yielded few loci associated with schizophrenia. To identify genetic risk variations for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population, we performed a two-stage GWAS of schizophrenia comprising 4384 cases and 5770 controls, followed by independent replications of 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in an additional 4339 schizophrenia cases and 7043 controls of Han Chinese ancestry. Furthermore, we conducted additional analyses based on the results in the discovery stage.

27927641	Genetic architecture distinguishes systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis from other forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: clinical and therapeutic implications.	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group of conditions unified by the presence of chronic childhood arthritis without an identifiable cause. Systemic JIA (sJIA) is a rare form of JIA characterised by systemic inflammation. sJIA is distinguished from other forms of JIA by unique clinical features and treatment responses that are similar to autoinflammatory diseases. However, approximately half of children with sJIA develop destructive, long-standing arthritis that appears similar to other forms of JIA. Using genomic approaches, we sought to gain novel insights into the pathophysiology of sJIA and its relationship with other forms of JIA.	 25658688 23337074 21684384 18632147 22384356 26598658 20896907 22442009 27240213 23752797 24075010 22679300 17572673 27307527 24765526 21647204 21538322 22354554 14760812 21196588 22290637 20233754 23603761 20509871 17360565 23450725 25114627

27936112	Genome-Wide Association of Heroin Dependence in Han Chinese.	Drug addiction is a costly and recurring healthcare problem, necessitating a need to understand risk factors and mechanisms of addiction, and to identify new biomarkers. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for heroin addiction have been limited; moreover they have been restricted to examining samples of European and African-American origin due to difficulty of recruiting samples from other populations. This is the first study to test a Han Chinese population; we performed a GWAS on a homogeneous sample of 370 Han Chinese subjects diagnosed with heroin dependence using the DSM-IV criteria and 134 ethnically matched controls. Analysis using the diagnostic criteria of heroin dependence yielded suggestive evidence for association between variants in the genes CCDC42 (coiled coil domain 42; p = 2.8x10-7) and BRSK2 (BR serine/threonine 2; p = 4.110-6). In addition, we found evidence for risk variants within the ARHGEF10 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10) gene on chromosome 8 and variants in a region on chromosome 20q13, which is gene-poor but has a concentration of mRNAs and predicted miRNAs. Gene-based association analysis identified genome-wide significant association between variants in CCDC42 and heroin addiction. Additionally, when we investigated shared risk variants between heroin addiction and risk of other addiction-related and psychiatric phenotypes using polygenic risk scores, we found a suggestive relationship with variants predicting tobacco addiction, and a significant relationship with variants predicting schizophrenia. Our genome wide association study of heroin dependence provides data in a novel sample, with functionally plausible results and evidence of genetic data of value to the field.	 1970380 14708003 15734726 26432245 12373743 23974872 18179280 24395778 12478284 21926972 20575833 25275565 15184239 20201854 23266708 16630837 25550326 18518925 11338173 23555274 25885710 9322237 18300295 11933204 24143882 19684571 20418888 8886164 12850432 23428655 25518859 25722852 26392368 23453885 21546393 26443613 12668357 8210179 12116270 11920858 20598278 20732627 22547174 11054768 22472876 9438836 21321325 24450588 24657165 25338720 11826272 22843986 18195715 22084102 19664686 26239289 20622878 17701901 16703401 17440936 11134674 21205799 14508709 20520587 9311927 15464124 16776597 19571811 11182085 21839728 25360393 15896927 15694871

28000841	Genome-wide association scans for idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head in a Korean population.	Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a multifactorial disease and is associated with genetic predisposition, and exposure to certain risk factors. In particular, idiopathic ONFH in twins and the clustering of cases in families have indicated that genetic factors are involved. However, the majority of cases of ONFH are sporadic and various studies have demonstrated that differences in the study design and/or the ethnic groups analyzed leads to different results. The present study performed one of the first genome‑wide association studies to identify genetic loci that may increase the risk of idiopathic ONFH. In total, 217 patients with idiopathic ONFH and 217 control samples, without ONFH, were genotyped using Axiom™ chips. Following quality control, 509,886 single‑nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the association analysis to identify genetic variants that may influence susceptibility to idiopathic ONFH. The lowest P‑value identified by the current study was for an association with rs220324 (P=3.57x10‑7), an SNP that is located near to the uromodulin‑like 1 gene region on chromosome 21q22.3, although none of the SNPs reached the traditional genome‑wide significance level of 5x10‑8. However, the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C6 (DNAJC6) locus, a region between 65.37 and 65.67 Mb located on chromosome 1p31.3, harbored a cluster of SNPs that were associated with idiopathic ONFH at a significance level of P<1x10‑5. Four variants, rs10493374, rs12032616, rs17127529 and rs6679032, with marginal associations were located in and around the DNAJC6 locus and were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. In conclusion, the current study did not identify any SNPs that were associated with idiopathic ONFH at a genome‑wide significance level, however, the results suggest that future studies should investigate the effects of SNPs in the DNAJC6 gene on the idiopathic ONFH risk.	 11801474 19640674 9005894 18350352 22216198 12672200 2076924 24521025 24859358 7979587 12430099 25895112 19765210 15297300 12438962 477083 15930420 16990180 17701901 16228001 17472306 25724068 8191398 9973987 12083492
27976721	A large-scale genome-wide association and meta-analysis identified four novel susceptibility loci for leprosy.	Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease, results from the uncultivable pathogen Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), and usually progresses to peripheral neuropathy and permanent progressive deformity if not treated. Previously published genetic studies have identified 18 gene/loci significantly associated with leprosy at the genome-wide significant level. However as a complex disease, only a small proportion of leprosy risk could be explained by those gene/loci. To further identify more susceptibility gene/loci, we hereby performed a three-stage GWAS comprising 8,156 leprosy patients and 15,610 controls of Chinese ancestry.

27992416	Genome-wide association analyses of sleep disturbance traits identify new loci and highlight shared genetics with neuropsychiatric and metabolic traits.	Chronic sleep disturbances, associated with cardiometabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders and all-cause mortality, affect 25-30% of adults worldwide. Although environmental factors contribute substantially to self-reported habitual sleep duration and disruption, these traits are heritable and identification of the genes involved should improve understanding of sleep, mechanisms linking sleep to disease and development of new therapies. We report single- and multiple-trait genome-wide association analyses of self-reported sleep duration, insomnia symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness in the UK Biobank (n = 112,586). We discover loci associated with insomnia symptoms (near MEIS1, TMEM132E, CYCL1 and TGFBI in females and WDR27 in males), excessive daytime sleepiness (near AR-OPHN1) and a composite sleep trait (near PATJ (INADL) and HCRTR2) and replicate a locus associated with sleep duration (at PAX8). We also observe genetic correlation between longer sleep duration and schizophrenia risk (r	 9645828 22194182 7984285 27270109 22948381 14713950 23703215 27270105 23431030 24937041 27397570 2267475 6684786 26955885 26612778 20493544 15941867 25056061 25642630 21779176 26426478 22463865 25500260 23728906 24995868 18172212 15954201 17572673 27494321 22794246 16402133 23643826 20616382 25722852 17903308 22064162 24189774 14988405 15301991 26835600 24642863 26414676 26464489 24553384 20811451 22851813 20950788 12126983 25526970 12514190 25642633 21628140 9565034 26414678 21532960 24834023 19126776 21784243 26470788 12421752 17554300 21980299 22105623 27131503 25826379 22654183 26600102 17637780 19679812 22197814 19090322 18317468 23202124 17698924 10348008 10100809 20956978 24780288 26717537 25673413 17702581 23624560 22704400 7826638 25363779 19543373 24728038 26657631 20081858 9463350 25142570 25469926 12421751
27992413	Genome-wide association study of primary sclerosing cholangitis identifies new risk loci and quantifies the genetic relationship with inflammatory bowel disease.	Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disorder leading to bile duct destruction; ∼75% of patients have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We undertook the largest genome-wide association study of PSC (4,796 cases and 19,955 population controls) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci. The most associated SNP at one locus affects splicing and expression of UBASH3A, with the protective allele (C) predicted to cause nonstop-mediated mRNA decay and lower expression of UBASH3A. Further analyses based on common variants suggested that the genome-wide genetic correlation (r	 21151127 26432245 25651891 24092820 16862161 20172772 26367797 20562875 25230735 25642630 24013639 24037378 17898773 24424180 22554193 26192919 24830394 21538284 22407885 26626624 18674735 22843982 19944697 22821403 20616382 21376301 20354512 22057162 22521342 23603763 19430480 9536098 22446964 24604202 23715323 24604203 17037993 23737752 25559196 25684965 19561590 23269371 21167468 7439807 24487584 19543373 24001487 26974007 22561518 26053495
27997041	Genetic variation at 16q24.2 is associated with small vessel stroke.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at identifying associations with stroke and stroke subtypes, but have not yet identified any associations solely with small vessel stroke (SVS). SVS comprises one quarter of all ischemic stroke and is a major manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment. Studies across neurological traits have shown that younger-onset cases have an increased genetic burden. We leveraged this increased genetic burden by performing an age-at-onset informed GWAS meta-analysis, including a large younger-onset SVS population, to identify novel associations with stroke.	 27068588 24656865 24390345 11315092 25693563 7678184 16862161 26619357 26243229 23128226 25773351 22253318 25233095 24138928 22064851 25250569 26708676 24830394 24709820 27322543 26086184 22820512 17967776 26935894 22955616 26037017 14981172 20616382 23144628 26674333 22306652 21251332 18852200 26732560 24656863 12714707 18031707 17901381 23867200 23041239 25078452 14718359 23269371 12801727 25550368 22243964 26390057 24572595 22492648 24013639 25954001

28011710	Identification of novel loci affecting circulating chromogranins and related peptides.	Chromogranins are pro-hormone secretory proteins released from neuroendocrine cells, with effects on control of blood pressure. We conducted a genome-wide association study for plasma catestatin, the catecholamine release inhibitory peptide derived from chromogranin A (CHGA), and other CHGA- or chromogranin B (CHGB)-related peptides, in 545 US and 1252 Australian subjects. This identified loci on chromosomes 4q35 and 5q34 affecting catestatin concentration (P = 3.40 × 10-30 for rs4253311 and 1.85 × 10-19 for rs2731672, respectively). Genes in these regions include the proteolytic enzymes kallikrein (KLKB1) and Factor XII (F12). In chromaffin cells, CHGA and KLKB1 proteins co-localized in catecholamine storage granules. In vitro, kallikrein cleaved recombinant human CHGA to catestatin, verified by mass spectrometry. The peptide identified from this digestion (CHGA360-373) selectively inhibited nicotinic cholinergic stimulated catecholamine release from chromaffin cells. A proteolytic cascade involving kallikrein and Factor XII cleaves chromogranins to active compounds both in vivo and in vitro.	 19017515 16554546 11463151 24954895 25774921 22535963 19620246 15705422 15367723 17438154 20662728 20067366 8457772 21858560 20616382 25177680 27126040 12646671 15166183 16007257 2345487 19372204 19896111 9490684 26821570 26567709 15882546 17718510 18299326 12194918 26343387 21886157 17701901 26668630 25477429 17411342 22388654 17598838 9294131 17991725 12537877 24266713 23381795 18591442
28002826	The CAPN2/CAPN8 Locus on Chromosome 1q Is Associated with Variation in Serum Alpha-Carotene Concentrations.	Alpha-carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid present in fruits and vegetables. Higher serum concentrations of α-carotene have been associated with lower risk of cancer and all-cause mortality. Previous studies have suggested that genetic variants influence serum concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids, but to date no variants have been robustly associated with serum α-carotene concentrations. The aim of this study was to identify genetic associations with serum α-carotene concentrations using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach.	 22051423 21098341 20686710 24266866 21432259 24131318 2795693 8127329 8602179 24638908 10875465 8609663 22427650 22818906 19185284 9184773 12473185 19603510 17349800 18776909 26861389 8131277 18440328 17570925 21163596 1423303
28011712	Genome-wide association study of Parkinson's disease in East Asians.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on Parkinson's disease (PD) have mostly been done in Europeans and Japanese. No study has been done in Han Chinese, which make up nearly a fifth of the world population. We conducted the first Han Chinese GWAS analysing a total of 22,729 subjects (5,125 PD cases and 17,604 controls) from Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea, mainland China and Taiwan. We performed imputation, merging and logistic regression analyses of 2,402,394 SNPs passing quality control filters in 779 PD cases, 13,227 controls, adjusted for the first three principal components. 90 SNPs with association P < 10-4 were validated in 9 additional sample collections and the results were combined using fixed-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis. We observed strong associations reaching genome-wide significance at SNCA, LRRK2 and MCCC1, confirming their important roles in both European and Asian PD. We also identified significant (P < 0.05) associations at 5 loci (DLG2, SIPA1L2, STK39, VPS13C and RIT2), and observed the same direction of associations at 9 other loci including BST1 and PARK16. Allelic heterogeneity was observed at LRRK2 while European risk SNPs at 6 other loci including MAPT and GBA-SYT11 were non-polymorphic or very rare in our cohort. Overall, we replicate associations at SNCA, LRRK2, MCCC1 and 14 other European PD loci but did not identify Asian-specific loci with large effects (OR > 1.45) on PD risk. Our results also demonstrate some differences in the genetic contribution to PD between Europeans and Asians. Further pan-ethnic meta-analysis with European GWAS cohorts may unravel new PD loci.	
28017375	Genome-wide Trans-ethnic Meta-analysis Identifies Seven Genetic Loci Influencing Erythrocyte Traits and a Role for RBPMS in Erythropoiesis.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified loci for erythrocyte traits in primarily European ancestry populations. We conducted GWAS meta-analyses of six erythrocyte traits in 71,638 individuals from European, East Asian, and African ancestries using a Bayesian approach to account for heterogeneity in allelic effects and variation in the structure of linkage disequilibrium between ethnicities. We identified seven loci for erythrocyte traits including a locus (RBPMS/GTF2E2) associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume. Statistical fine-mapping at this locus pointed to RBPMS at this locus and excluded nearby GTF2E2. Using zebrafish morpholino to evaluate loss of function, we observed a strong in vivo erythropoietic effect for RBPMS but not for GTF2E2, supporting the statistical fine-mapping at this locus and demonstrating that RBPMS is a regulator of erythropoiesis. Our findings show the utility of trans-ethnic GWASs for discovery and characterization of genetic loci influencing hematologic traits.	 25019302 23576214 15090461 17211848 24240475 16751102 24647736 21526222 24560123 12228720 22929040 27399967 23446634 22125221 20833975 22213601 14609996 23267103 11423617 23696099 8589427 23935956 21153663 10723803 24760767 22517427 21565292 23022100 19535546 4054596 16077740 21738480 12724300 20616382 21533135 18798982 23440203 22736163 20927387 19820697 23406875 19862010 24816252 21221095 19261174 10581172 21738479 23243273 7851788 20139978 21292315 22036566 11560912 23104008 15231652 23222517 17355169 23251661 23263863 22479202 17099224 19820698 17406303 8855282 22423221 11855950 25096241
28012008	Bivariate genome-wide association analyses identified genetic pleiotropic effects for bone mineral density and alcohol drinking in Caucasians.	Several studies indicated bone mineral density (BMD) and alcohol intake might share common genetic factors. The study aimed to explore potential SNPs/genes related to both phenotypes in US Caucasians at the genome-wide level. A bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 2069 unrelated participants. Regular drinking was graded as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, representing drinking alcohol never, less than once, once or twice, three to six times, seven to ten times, or more than ten times per week respectively. Hip, spine, and whole body BMDs were measured. The bivariate GWAS was conducted on the basis of a bivariate linear regression model. Sex-stratified association analyses were performed in the male and female subgroups. In males, the most significant association signal was detected in SNP rs685395 in DYNC2H1 with bivariate spine BMD and alcohol drinking (P = 1.94 × 10	 1558307 16980579 17620054 19244365 19361615 19874574 20379614 23647036 21927919 24384043 9528932 15797878 22800300 16476706 15852005 10355374 19718259 24042328 26110981 19450718 24421289 14619387 17671275 21552265 23094033 11772476 18040801 24183449 23917160 9758596 19489754 25428435 23962793 9763149 20201926 21059924 18486241 16269906 24464050 22661623 19840550 17989061 1386337
28008999	Genetic architecture differences between pediatric and adult-onset inflammatory bowel diseases in the Polish population.	Most inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are classic complex disorders represented by common alleles. Here we aimed to define the genetic architecture of pediatric and adult-onset IBDs for the Polish population. A total of 1495 patients were recruited, including 761 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 424 pediatric), 734 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 390 pediatric), and 934 healthy controls. Allelotyping employed a pooled-DNA genome-wide association study (GWAS) and was validated by individual genotyping. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 44 IBD patients diagnosed before 6 years of age, 45 patients diagnosed after 40 years of age, and 18 healthy controls. Altogether, out of 88 selected SNPs, 31 SNPs were replicated for association with IBD.

28317148	Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy: A genome-wide association study on multiple myeloma patients.	The proteasome-inhibitor bortezomib was introduced into the treatment of multiple myeloma more than a decade ago. It is clinically beneficial, but peripheral neuropathy (PNP) is a side effect that may limit its use in some patients. To examine the possible genetic predisposing factors to PNP, we performed a genome-wide association study on 646 bortezomib-treated German multiple myeloma patients. Our aim was to identify genetic risk variants associated with the development of PNP as a serious side effect of the treatment. We identified 4 new promising loci for bortezomib-induced PNP at 4q34.3 (rs6552496), 5q14.1 (rs12521798), 16q23.3 (rs8060632), and 18q21.2 (rs17748074). Even though the results did not reach genome-wide significance level, they support the idea of previous studies, suggesting a genetic basis for neurotoxicity. The identified single nucleotide polymorphisms map to genes or next to genes involved in the development and function of the nervous system (CDH13, DCC, and TENM3). As possible functional clues, 2 of the variants, rs12521798 and rs17748074, affect enhancer histone marks in the brain. The rs12521798 may also impact expression of THBS4, which affects specific signal trasduction pathways in the nervous system. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism of action of the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the development of drug-induced PNP and to functionally validate our in silico predictions.	
28222112	Genome-wide study of resistant hypertension identified from electronic health records.	Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above treatment goals in spite of the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents from different classes. Despite the important health consequences of resistant hypertension, few studies of resistant hypertension have been conducted. To perform a genome-wide association study for resistant hypertension, we defined and identified cases of resistant hypertension and hypertensives with treated, controlled hypertension among >47,500 adults residing in the US linked to electronic health records (EHRs) and genotyped as part of the electronic MEdical Records & GEnomics (eMERGE) Network. Electronic selection logic using billing codes, laboratory values, text queries, and medication records was used to identify resistant hypertension cases and controls at each site, and a total of 3,006 cases of resistant hypertension and 876 controlled hypertensives were identified among eMERGE Phase I and II sites. After imputation and quality control, a total of 2,530,150 SNPs were tested for an association among 2,830 multi-ethnic cases of resistant hypertension and 876 controlled hypertensives. No test of association was genome-wide significant in the full dataset or in the dataset limited to European American cases (n = 1,719) and controls (n = 708). The most significant finding was CLNK rs13144136 at p = 1.00x10-6 (odds ratio = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.58-0.80) in the full dataset with similar results in the European American only dataset. We also examined whether SNPs known to influence blood pressure or hypertension also influenced resistant hypertension. None was significant after correction for multiple testing. These data highlight both the difficulties and the potential utility of EHR-linked genomic data to study clinically-relevant traits such as resistant hypertension.	 21347282 24097068 19474294 26432245 16862161 14656957 10835412 21269473 23128226 23531748 22125226 22796254 23165303 15661075 26162070 19279659 24987407 24165912 24954895 11062596 25418497 10075613 16208153 21626137 22534870 26092718 20443953 24316577 23743551 21787111 23972371 21909110 22820512 24352519 19650939 26092716 21234875 9934342 21572416 19430479 14657064 21386085 26441289 20686565 25385345 25635347 20581827 24001895 18852389 20103027 16415888 21533139 21981779 19022154 17413273 23726159 18974833 22713143 18574054 23169802 27802415 24903457 25566314 24509480 20733501 25249183 18500243 19908384 11394896 15326093 22013104 26425837 15596575 19430483 24309125 26198781 20634204 17701901 23269371 25189868 23580788 21909115 21508311 22322875 11802745 20948529 21819236 27026615 17159087 24124408 24896101 21082022

28046027	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Four Loci for Lipid Ratios in the Korean Population and the Constitutional Subgroup.	Circulating lipid ratios are considered predictors of cardiovascular risks and metabolic syndrome, which cause coronary heart diseases. One constitutional type of Korean medicine prone to weight accumulation, the Tae-Eum type, predisposes the consumers to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants for lipid ratios using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and followed replication analysis in Koreans and constitutional subgroups. GWASs in 5,292 individuals of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study and replication analyses in 2,567 subjects of the Korea medicine Data Center were performed to identify genetic variants associated with triglyceride (TG) to HDL cholesterol (HDLC), LDL cholesterol (LDLC) to HDLC, and non-HDLC to HDLC ratios. For subgroup analysis, a computer-based constitution analysis tool was used to categorize the constitutional types of the subjects. In the discovery stage, seven variants in four loci, three variants in three loci, and two variants in one locus were associated with the ratios of log-transformed TG:HDLC (log[TG]:HDLC), LDLC:HDLC, and non-HDLC:HDLC, respectively. The associations of the GWAS variants with lipid ratios were replicated in the validation stage: for the log[TG]:HDLC ratio, rs6589566 near APOA5 and rs4244457 and rs6586891 near LPL; for the LDLC:HDLC ratio, rs4420638 near APOC1 and rs17445774 near C2orf47; and for the non-HDLC:HDLC ratio, rs6589566 near APOA5. Five of these six variants are known to be associated with TG, LDLC, and/or HDLC, but rs17445774 was newly identified to be involved in lipid level changes in this study. Constitutional subgroup analysis revealed effects of variants associated with log[TG]:HDLC and non-HDLC:HDLC ratios in both the Tae-Eum and non-Tae-Eum types, whereas the effect of the LDLC:HDLC ratio-associated variants remained only in the Tae-Eum type. In conclusion, we identified three log[TG]:HDLC ratio-associated variants, two LDLC:HDLC ratio-associated variants, and one non-HDLC:HDLC-associated variant in Koreans and the constitutional subgroups.	 23300848 24097068 25005712 18719750 15246907 25034063 22454673 3802833 20972352 19745018 23545148 25428361 3095375 23246289 20686565 4020294 22762505 25411193 15297300 21146241 21775750 21679732 24387992 20634204 21860654 17701901 24348702 23695286 19033209 17699011 21167468 19396169 19745009 23548105 3179802 8596571
28051079	Genome-wide association scan of neuropathic pain symptoms post total joint replacement highlights a variant in the protein-kinase C gene.	Neuropathic pain-like joint symptoms (NP) are seen in a proportion of individuals diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) and post total joint replacement (TJR). In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using NP as defined by the painDETECT questionnaire (score >12 indicating possible NP) in 613 post-TJR participants recruited from Nottinghamshire (UK). The prevalence of possible NP was 17.8%. The top four hits from the GWAS and two other biologically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were replicated in individuals with OA and post TJR from an independent study in the same area (N=908) and in individuals from the Rotterdam Study (N=212). Three of these SNPs showed effect sizes in the same direction as in the GWAS results in both replication cohorts.

28054174	Genome-wide meta-analyses of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts identify novel associations between FOXE1 and all orofacial clefts, and TP63 and cleft lip with or without cleft palate.	Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are a heterogeneous group of common craniofacial birth defects with complex etiologies that include genetic and environmental risk factors. OFCs are commonly categorized as cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate alone (CP), which have historically been analyzed as distinct entities. Genes for both CL/P and CP have been identified via multiple genome-wide linkage and association studies (GWAS); however, altogether, known variants account for a minority of the estimated heritability in risk to these craniofacial birth defects. We performed genome-wide meta-analyses of CL/P, CP, and all OFCs across two large, multiethnic studies. We then performed population-specific meta-analyses in sub-samples of Asian and European ancestry. In addition to observing associations with known variants, we identified a novel genome-wide significant association between SNPs located in an intronic TP63 enhancer and CL/P (p = 1.16 × 10	 10839977 16292776 21618603 20023658 19779022 25775280 24009034 27033726 25704602 22064851 11528512 23512105 11159940 10535733 19465376 24563486 18836445 19656524 21963426 26968009 10227294 12037717 22750566 21331089 27018472 9697704 25567987 22863734 20643356 24124047 12766194 2918525 25652407 25430793 19521098 19270707 25798845 20436469 17377962 22508319 24777480 23008150 27018475 26657631 25786657 24159046
28062665	Genome-wide association studies identify PRKCB as a novel genetic susceptibility locus for primary biliary cholangitis in the Japanese population.	A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in 963 Japanese individuals (487 primary biliary cholangitis [PBC] cases and 476 healthy controls) identified TNFSF15 (rs4979462) and POU2AF1 (rs4938534) as strong susceptibility loci for PBC. In this study, we performed GWAS in additional 1,923 Japanese individuals (894 PBC cases and 1,029 healthy controls), and combined the results with the previous data. This GWAS, together with a subsequent replication study in an independent set of 7,024 Japanese individuals (512 PBC cases and 6,512 healthy controls), identified PRKCB (rs7404928) as a novel susceptibility locus for PBC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, P = 4.13 × 10-9). Furthermore, a primary functional variant of PRKCB (rs35015313) was identified by genotype imputation using a phased panel of 1,070 Japanese individuals from a prospective, general population cohort study and subsequent in vitro functional analyses.

28067908	Genome-wide association study implicates immune activation of multiple integrin genes in inflammatory bowel disease.	Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease, thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization.	 26878233 28067910 23266558 18832364 26432245 21297633 25082827 12047962 24092820 26708335 26367797 27785270 16990136 25642630 22500001 23964932 19692703 17241859 23075178 17694047 23128233 24830394 11528384 24413527 19029904 27807284 25785968 25140736 17435756 22837484 17554261 22236196 19647202 12297042 25979421 26192919 23000145 24814090 25799045 16267322 18580884 24739972 24487276 21336274 21170755 23104008 24313777 22593622 23850713 18642345 24629344 22412388 23964933 26974007
28067912	Genome-wide association study identifies distinct genetic contributions to prognosis and susceptibility in Crohn's disease.	For most immune-mediated diseases, the main determinant of patient well-being is not the diagnosis itself but instead the course that the disease takes over time (prognosis). Prognosis may vary substantially between patients for reasons that are poorly understood. Familial studies support a genetic contribution to prognosis, but little evidence has been found for a proposed association between prognosis and the burden of susceptibility variants. To better characterize how genetic variation influences disease prognosis, we performed a within-cases genome-wide association study in two cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease. We identified four genome-wide significant loci, none of which showed any association with disease susceptibility. Conversely, the aggregated effect of all 170 disease susceptibility loci was not associated with disease prognosis. Together, these data suggest that the genetic contribution to prognosis in Crohn's disease is largely independent of the contribution to disease susceptibility and point to a biology of prognosis that could provide new therapeutic opportunities.	 17668372 8707121 21085122 26367797 18824555 17206705 7558912 21156761 15022313 26490195 24053356 2917275 23128233 21249183 26192919 23731541 23104886 23300620 20436464 19859063 11723196 24813542 24344320 25921272 26414676 24419484 15621218 21431839 25948629 8535651 1825504 14687822 25559196 21931699 10979604 22212245 17554300 27663502 20418889 17701901 23459081 20368992 23269371 24743097 2212697 24035192 20981092 25979711 23263249 19543373 26123020 12631669
28070124	An endophenotype approach to the genetics of alcohol dependence: a genome wide association study of fast beta EEG in families of African ancestry.	Fast beta (20-28 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory activity may be a useful endophenotype for studying the genetics of disorders characterized by neural hyperexcitability, including substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the genetic underpinnings of fast beta EEG have not previously been studied in a population of African-American ancestry (AA). In a sample of 2382 AA individuals from 482 families drawn from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on resting-state fast beta EEG power. To further characterize our genetic findings, we examined the functional and clinical/behavioral significance of GWAS variants.

28073927	New insights into the genetics of primary open-angle glaucoma based on meta-analyses of intraocular pressure and optic disc characteristics.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common optic neuropathy, is a heritable disease. Siblings of POAG cases have a ten-fold increased risk of developing the disease. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve head characteristics are used clinically to predict POAG risk. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of IOP and optic disc parameters and validated our findings in multiple sets of POAG cases and controls. Using imputation to the 1000 genomes (1000G) reference set, we identified 9 new genomic regions associated with vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR) and 1 new region associated with IOP. Additionally, we found 5 novel loci for optic nerve cup area and 6 for disc area. Previously it was assumed that genetic variation influenced POAG either through IOP or via changes to the optic nerve head; here we present evidence that some genomic regions affect both IOP and the disc parameters. We characterized the effect of the novel loci through pathway analysis and found that pathways involved are not entirely distinct as assumed so far. Further, we identified a novel association between CDKN1A and POAG. Using a zebrafish model we show that six6b (associated with POAG and optic nerve head variation) alters the expression of cdkn1a. In summary, we have identified several novel genes influencing the major clinical risk predictors of POAG and showed that genetic variation in CDKN1A is important in POAG risk.	 22751097 20237253 21059592 25631615 8340400 14738489 25597830 21532571 24150847 25642630 21839727 22064851 23049825 19578367 26365380 25173107 9326927 21961510 24875647 22634755 7478594 9869795 19578553 24825645 24316576 22605921 21873608 10571340 7973727 25173106 25518859 25173105 18639375 20616382 22570627 19198609 1423616 19558368 20727350 23279740 26414676 19995197 21427129 20548946 25637523 25241763 22528500 17463248 23837818 22581228 23500522 27241461 22955989 20634204 20453838 23922970 25398906 20835238 25855136 17701901 25217961 21076409 22961961 22828004 14523050 18184265 22570617 21961509 23086717 9326941 15921747
28077804	The complex genetics of gait speed: genome-wide meta-analysis approach.	Emerging evidence suggests that the basis for variation in late-life mobility is attributable, in part, to genetic factors, which may become increasingly important with age. Our objective was to systematically assess the contribution of genetic variation to gait speed in older individuals. We conducted a meta-analysis of gait speed GWASs in 31,478 older adults from 17 cohorts of the CHARGE consortium, and validated our results in 2,588 older adults from 4 independent studies. We followed our initial discoveries with network and eQTL analysis of candidate signals in tissues. The meta-analysis resulted in a list of 536 suggestive genome wide significant SNPs in or near 69 genes. Further interrogation with Pathway Analysis placed gait speed as a polygenic complex trait in five major networks. Subsequent eQTL analysis revealed several SNPs significantly associated with the expression of PRSS16, WDSUB1 and PTPRT, which in addition to the meta-analysis and pathway suggested that genetic effects on gait speed may occur through synaptic function and neuronal development pathways. No genome-wide significant signals for gait speed were identified from this moderately large sample of older adults, suggesting that more refined physical function phenotypes will be needed to identify the genetic basis of gait speed in aging.	 22437878 20304771 21738491 19924348 20039582 10719763 19730377 19706596 19950302 21820535 11170751 22976292 23681449 24763978 21072744 24381304 23832395 17077203 22064851 26098115 22384243 24973796 22363741 11516827 17237140 18498210 21512513 23450464 20881960 22234866 16282563 19349593 18668548 20616382 23456457 26923472 23894747 23584080 10952367 20235850 10811152 23213483 23474884 18547681 21205966 26219847 21258136 23902934 18250093 25142358 19249006 20634204 23526225 22844989 24997018 24313907 25198863 24456831 25939412 20494103 19727025 24411736 17671797 25572423 24896365 25580908 17576800 17118964

28081215	Genome-Wide Association Studies of Multiple Keratinocyte Cancers.	There is strong evidence for a role of environmental risk factors involved in susceptibility to develop multiple keratinocyte cancers (mKCs), but whether genes are also involved in mKCs susceptibility has not been thoroughly investigated. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with susceptibility for mKCs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,666 cases with mKCs and 1,950 cases with single KC (sKCs; controls) from Harvard cohorts (the Nurses' Health Study [NHS], NHS II, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study) and the Framingham Heart Study was carried-out using over 8 million SNPs (stage-1). We sought to replicate the most significant statistical associations (p-value≤ 5.5x10-6) in an independent cohort of 574 mKCs and 872 sKCs from the Rotterdam Study. In the discovery stage, 40 SNPs with suggestive associations (p-value ≤5.5x10-6) were identified, with eight independent SNPs tagging all 40 SNPs. The most significant SNP was located at chromosome 9 (rs7468390; p-value = 3.92x10-7). In stage-2, none of these SNPs replicated and only two of them were associated with mKCs in the same direction in the combined meta-analysis. We tested the associations for 19 previously reported basal cell carcinoma-related SNPs (candidate gene association analysis), and found that rs1805007 (MC1R locus) was significantly associated with risk of mKCs (p-value = 2.80x10-4). Although the suggestive SNPs with susceptibility for mKCs were not replicated, we found that previously identified BCC variants may also be associated with mKC, which the most significant association (rs1805007) located at the MC1R gene.	 20304771 18974171 8681379 17372189 23548203 9931336 22211791 3452822 18849993 21546449 1347096 19516264 22820512 25588079 25190484 20616382 20233392 21818773 11472063 26121210 3962971 1208363 1342273 19812666 24762786 22670903 25855136 25801793 20171403 22360801 26386597 23608733 17429138

28087736	Imputation of orofacial clefting data identifies novel risk loci and sheds light on the genetic background of cleft lip ± cleft palate and cleft palate only.	Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) is among the most common human birth defects with multifactorial etiology. Here, we present results from a genome-wide imputation study of nsCL/P in which, after adding replication cohort data, four novel risk loci for nsCL/P are identified (at chromosomal regions 2p21, 14q22, 15q24 and 19p13). On a systematic level, we show that the association signals within this high-density dataset are enriched in functionally-relevant genomic regions that are active in both human neural crest cells (hNCC) and mouse embryonic craniofacial tissue. This enrichment is also detectable in hNCC regions primed for later activity. Using GCTA analyses, we suggest that 30% of the estimated variance in risk for nsCL/P in the European population can be attributed to common variants, with 25.5% contributed to by the 24 risk loci known to date. For each of these, we identify credible SNPs using a Bayesian refinement approach, with two loci harbouring only one probable causal variant. Finally, we demonstrate that there is no polygenic component of nsCL/P detectable that is shared with nonsyndromic cleft palate only (nsCPO). Our data suggest that, while common variants are strongly contributing to risk for nsCL/P, they do not seem to be involved in nsCPO which might be more often caused by rare deleterious variants. Our study generates novel insights into both nsCL/P and nsCPO etiology and provides a systematic framework for research into craniofacial development and malformation.	 24144296 22976473 24360809 25693563 26432245 21618603 25044438 16936789 22095910 20023658 22341974 25950237 24634360 25597830 23028347 19779022 24974849 25056061 25775280 27033726 25704602 23762245 19097194 26072432 27287806 21885341 24316577 23512105 27321816 24563486 18836445 17572673 22936215 21106759 26968009 16420271 27018472 26436110 19752161 26406328 10353778 24382704 22863734 19143809 19212405 25652407 19270707 26367794 20634204 21160473 16341016 21292315 17701901 22759666 20436469 23559552 25990418 26072433 23104008 19583827 21167468 27193062 25855579 19571811 23463464 25751624 27018475 19543373 21807998 18250102 22981823 24159046

28093568	GWAS meta-analysis reveals novel loci and genetic correlates for general cognitive function: a report from the COGENT consortium.	The complex nature of human cognition has resulted in cognitive genomics lagging behind many other fields in terms of gene discovery using genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods. In an attempt to overcome these barriers, the current study utilized GWAS meta-analysis to examine the association of common genetic variation (~8M single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with minor allele frequency ⩾1%) to general cognitive function in a sample of 35 298 healthy individuals of European ancestry across 24 cohorts in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT). In addition, we utilized individual SNP lookups and polygenic score analyses to identify genetic overlap with other relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes. Our primary GWAS meta-analysis identified two novel SNP loci (top SNPs: rs76114856 in the CENPO gene on chromosome 2 and rs6669072 near LOC105378853 on chromosome 1) associated with cognitive performance at the genome-wide significance level (P<5 × 10	 20351040 25644384 22907506 26109713 18573145 24473328 26146885 15888485 25642630 20829693 24127197 25064009 15499021 26476593 23927501 19488046 26168413 17008307 25951819 25885710 21841781 23358156 23567438 21451499 22544367 25282103 19165922 26809841 20616382 25722852 25201988 21037248 22888466 27453576 21709683 26414676 22996553 23715323 15654335 25642633 23563607 27225129 24791031 22642228 26449760 21826061 16000317 22037486 23722424 25178429 24342994 19294424 25754080 12775797 20606400 19286853 17357068 27548312 22243964 20804247 15958136 20116045 18498206 25673413 16906163 22885922 22504418 27046643

28098162	Novel genetic loci associated with hippocampal volume.	The hippocampal formation is a brain structure integrally involved in episodic memory, spatial navigation, cognition and stress responsiveness. Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200 kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (r	 25693563 23419546 17407649 24572357 20009918 16682538 24381304 11832223 19401723 25056061 25642630 22683712 15450215 25127742 25607358 15988763 11732710 16823726 8421494 12031273 23770413 22504417 15275931 20616382 25569344 21807003 25234264 9572740 25750659 26414676 18621990 25936807 26414678 19405132 24162737 22360420 26122586 22504421 8848199 20882552 23504938 19786105 25174004 25199620 25444608 24817139 21397060 26033243 22958900 21352927 24275829 26857596 21282661 20573900 24638919
28100913	Genome-wide association study using the ethnicity-specific Japonica array: identification of new susceptibility loci for cold medicine-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome with severe ocular complications.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for cold medicine-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome (CM-SJS) with severe ocular complications (SOC) was performed in a Japanese population. A recently developed ethnicity-specific array with genome-wide imputation that was based on the whole-genome sequences of 1070 unrelated Japanese individuals was used. Validation analysis with additional samples from Japanese individuals and replication analysis using samples from Korean individuals identified two new susceptibility loci on chromosomes 15 and 16. This study might suggest the usefulness of GWAS using the ethnicity-specific array and genome-wide imputation based on large-scale whole-genome sequences. Our findings contribute to the understanding of genetic predisposition to CM-SJS with SOC.	
28107422	Comparison of HapMap and 1000 Genomes Reference Panels in a Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study.	An increasing number of genome-wide association (GWA) studies are now using the higher resolution 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (1000G) for imputation, with the expectation that 1000G imputation will lead to the discovery of additional associated loci when compared to HapMap imputation. In order to assess the improvement of 1000G over HapMap imputation in identifying associated loci, we compared the results of GWA studies of circulating fibrinogen based on the two reference panels. Using both HapMap and 1000G imputation we performed a meta-analysis of 22 studies comprising the same 91,953 individuals. We identified six additional signals using 1000G imputation, while 29 loci were associated using both HapMap and 1000G imputation. One locus identified using HapMap imputation was not significant using 1000G imputation. The genome-wide significance threshold of 5×10-8 is based on the number of independent statistical tests using HapMap imputation, and 1000G imputation may lead to further independent tests that should be corrected for. When using a stricter Bonferroni correction for the 1000G GWA study (P-value < 2.5×10-8), the number of loci significant only using HapMap imputation increased to 4 while the number of loci significant only using 1000G decreased to 5. In conclusion, 1000G imputation enabled the identification of 20% more loci than HapMap imputation, although the advantage of 1000G imputation became less clear when a stricter Bonferroni correction was used. More generally, our results provide insights that are applicable to the implementation of other dense reference panels that are under development.	 20231535 22976473 24929828 24097068 22675575 26105150 26367797 25663218 23128226 26343387 24578379 27350599 19715440 23696881 24443550 22143225 23255287 21743057 17676998 25282103 25934476 20616382 23202125 21300955 22990020 25621886 25961943 25637523 27694958 24223151 22504420 24816252 21502573 21058334 25673412 25108383 25173106 22306651 20876667 25344690 22293688 25772935 21909115 25673413 26561523 23969696 19543373 14685227 26132169 26386597 23714642

28128768	Effects of Multiple Genetic Loci on Age at Onset in Frontotemporal Dementia.	In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), age at disease onset (AAO) is unpredictable in both early and late-onset cases; AAO variability is found even in autosomal dominant FTD. The present study was aimed at identifying genetic modifiers modulating AAO in a large cohort of Italian FTD patients. We conducted an association analysis on 411 FTD patients, belonging to 7 Italian Centers, and for whom AAO was available. Population structure was evaluated by principal component analysis to infer continuous axes of genetic variation, and single linear regression models were applied. A genetic score (GS) was calculated on the basis of suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found by association analyses. GS showed genome-wide significant slope decrease by -3.86 (95% CI: -4.64 to -3.07, p < 2×10-16) per standard deviation of the GS for 6 SNPs mapping to genes involved in neuronal development and signaling, axonal myelinization, and glutamatergic/GABA neurotransmission. An increase of the GS was associated with a decrease of the AAO. Our data indicate that there is indeed a genetic component that underpins and modulates up to 14.5% of variability of AAO in Italian FTD. Future studies on genetic modifiers in FTD are warranted.	 23827811 20308423 21085122 26216298 25914293 26388768 24680031 24821223 26601739 21059989 21325651 26154020 26341907 23478837 25199842 21745336 21699684 26214276 21399481 27009575 21107309 24643514 25338720 24394289 17701901 21220649 19101631 26041104 24343233 23849776 21810890 23609620 22819134 24943344

28115739	Genome-wide association study of therapeutic opioid dosing identifies a novel locus upstream of OPRM1.	Opioids are very effective analgesics, but they are also highly addictive. Methadone is used to treat opioid dependence (OD), acting as a selective agonist at the μ-opioid receptor encoded by the gene OPRM1. Determining the optimal methadone maintenance dose is time consuming; currently, no biomarkers are available to guide treatment. In methadone-treated OD subjects drawn from a case and control sample, we conducted a genome-wide association study of usual daily methadone dose.

28135244	Genome-wide association analysis identifies novel blood pressure loci and offers biological insights into cardiovascular risk.	Elevated blood pressure is the leading heritable risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. We report genetic association of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure) among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry with independent replication in other cohorts, and robust validation of 107 independent loci. We also identify new independent variants at 11 previously reported blood pressure loci. In combination with results from a range of in silico functional analyses and wet bench experiments, our findings highlight new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation enriched for genes expressed in vascular tissues and identify potential therapeutic targets for hypertension. Results from genetic risk score models raise the possibility of a precision medicine approach through early lifestyle intervention to offset the impact of blood pressure-raising genetic variants on future cardiovascular disease risk.	 25194498 20238074 27428752 24457954 25597830 27318201 22539753 21845218 21415386 17339532 21884682 16407178 19927152 23561647 17572673 17468934 21572416 21380549 19430479 18650473 562066 15121769 3489574 22147895 26423011 20616382 21511256 23337395 11230330 26686565 25796436 20436461 23261430 27959714 16152135 27618447 26352407 16940217 25131978 22045659 11136953 12377087 24816252 25655479 23583979 15665834 18381398 26364544 23661711 20701291 21494592 9792870 23415669 19430483 25826379 15961551 25832858 11874986 17344938 19196915 23824729 27618448 26368830 27618452 3416162 26390057 22155868 24552295 25576628 20814019 27841878 20601685 26724178 27391979 23988577

28158719	Genome-wide association of white blood cell counts in Hispanic/Latino Americans: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils) differ by ethnicity. The genetic factors underlying basal WBC traits in Hispanics/Latinos are unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study of total WBC and differential counts in a large, ethnically diverse US population sample of Hispanics/Latinos ascertained by the Hispanic Community Health Study and Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We demonstrate that several previously known WBC-associated genetic loci (e.g. the African Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines null variant for neutrophil count) are generalizable to WBC traits in Hispanics/Latinos. We identified and replicated common and rare germ-line variants at FLT3 (a gene often somatically mutated in leukemia) associated with monocyte count. The common FLT3 variant rs76428106 has a large allele frequency differential between African and non-African populations. We also identified several novel genetic loci involving or regulating hematopoietic transcription factors (CEBPE-SLC7A7, CEBPA and CRBN-TRNT1) associated with basophil count. The minor allele of the CEBPE variant associated with lower basophil count has been previously associated with Amerindian ancestry and higher risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanics. Together, these data suggest that germline genetic variation affecting transcriptional and signaling pathways that underlie WBC development and lineage specification can contribute to inter-individual as well as ethnic differences in peripheral blood cell counts (normal hematopoiesis) in addition to susceptibility to leukemia (malignant hematopoiesis).	 26531826 20609343 16537811 21738478 24881937 18064533 22398613 23974679 27018471 8608220 22384356 25193871 17404350 23128226 19853236 20718045 24485662 19684604 23128233 20860503 23990620 11535508 20223979 10723803 9032264 9371821 25014893 25215878 21573225 25753223 22955616 26437776 19680446 4054596 21738480 18179887 20616382 19286519 24390342 20354512 20609344 24292625 19820697 18543314 26912059 27863252 22939635 19684603 24753091 24257098 21058334 16934002 18295580 21738479 22511882 16788101 17079688 27235756 25584925 27358854 23615557 25999453 23314186 28090672 23719191 23079061 11313242 19543373 19180233 26657631 25096241 25801432 26748518
28053049	Genome-wide association study with additional genetic and post-transcriptional analyses reveals novel regulators of plasma factor XI levels.	Coagulation factor XI (FXI) has become increasingly interesting for its role in pathogenesis of thrombosis. While elevated plasma levels of FXI have been associated with venous thromboembolism and ischemic stroke, its deficiency is associated with mild bleeding. We aimed to determine novel genetic and post-transcriptional plasma FXI regulators.We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma FXI levels, using novel data imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Individual GWAS analyses, including a total of 16,169 European individuals from the ARIC, GHS, MARTHA and PROCARDIS studies, were meta-analysed and further replicated in 2,045 individuals from the F5L family, GAIT2 and MEGA studies. Additional association with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was tested for the top SNPs. In addition, a study on the effect of miRNA on FXI regulation was performed using in silico prediction tools and in vitro luciferase assays.Three loci showed robust, replicating association with circulating FXI levels: KNG1 (rs710446, P-value = 2.07 × 10-302), F11 (rs4253417, P-value  = 2.86 × 10-193), and a novel association in GCKR (rs780094, P-value  = 3.56 ×10-09), here for the first time implicated in FXI regulation. The two first SNPs (rs710446 and rs4253417) also associated with aPTT. Conditional and haplotype analyses demonstrated a complex association signal, with additional novel SNPs modulating plasma FXI levels in both the F11 and KNG1 loci. Finally, eight miRNAs were predicted to bind F11 mRNA. Over-expression of either miR-145 or miR-181 significantly reduced the luciferase activity in cells transfected with a plasmid containing FXI-3'UTR.These results should open the door to new therapeutic targets for thrombosis prevention.	 20231535 20562444 25693563 17604727 19630773 21526222 24590770 16931632 20562875 22701019 22664986 18439548 21909094 22064851 25379760 15652477 17980034 25482425 23193183 17612493 21620721 17308338 19715440 19583818 26159646 24977287 24643644 23188048 18268095 26343387 25779970 16880142 10706899 20799968 25416803 24066149 20616382 18955434 25722852 21057700 17367492 12008966 17099704 25091233 18328308 19806245 26386215 20404252 25544755 21058334 18349091 24335146 15502875 21980494 24762786 20509871 17991681 22703881 22426310 20802025 26432016 21167468 25472531 25772935 21232005 18945968 21676895 19543373 25092234 21037258 21605702 20081858 24086496 26260105
28256260	Genetics of early-onset Parkinson's disease in Finland: exome sequencing and genome-wide association study.	Several genes and risk factors are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although many of the genetic markers belong to a common pathway, a unifying pathogenetic mechanism is yet to be found. Also, missing heritability analyses have estimated that only part of the genetic influence contributing to PD has been found. Here, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 438 Finnish patients with early-onset PD. We also reanalyzed previous data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the same cohort. Variants in the CEL gene/locus were associated with PD in both GWAS and WES analysis. Exome-wide gene-based association tests also identified the MPHOSPH10, TAS2R19, and SERPINA1 genes in the discovery data set (p < 2.5E-6). MPHOSPH10 had estimated odds ratio (OR) of 1.53, and the rs141620200 variant in SERPINA1 had OR of 1.27. We identified several candidate genes, but further investigation is required to determine the role of these genes in PD.	 24894501 27184740 25078778 25064009 22892372 16415888 26071818 22911860 27311081 27189761 26595808 1676983

28181694	A Genomewide Association Study Identifies Two Sex-Specific Loci, at SPTB and IZUMO3, Influencing Pediatric Bone Mineral Density at Multiple Skeletal Sites.	Failure to achieve optimal bone mineral accretion during childhood and adolescence results in subsequent suboptimal peak bone mass, contributing to osteoporosis risk later in life. To identify novel genetic factors that influence pediatric bone mass at discrete skeletal sites, we performed a sex-stratified genomewide association study of areal bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the 1/3 distal radius, spine, total hip, and femoral neck in a cohort of 933 healthy European American children.

28212542	Two-stage genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus associated with melanoma.	Genome-wide association studies have identified 21 susceptibility loci associated with melanoma. These loci implicate genes affecting pigmentation, nevus count, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair in melanoma risk. Here, we report the results of a two-stage genome-wide association study of melanoma. The stage 1 discovery phase consisted of 4,842 self-reported melanoma cases and 286,565 controls of European ancestry from the 23andMe research cohort and the stage 2 replication phase consisted of 1,804 melanoma cases and 1,026 controls from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. We performed a combined meta-analysis totaling 6,628 melanoma cases and 287,591 controls. Our study replicates 20 of 21 previously known melanoma-loci and confirms the association of the telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT, with melanoma susceptibility at genome-wide significance. In addition, we uncover a novel polymorphism, rs187843643 (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = [1.54, 2.48]; P = 3.53 x 10-8), associated with melanoma. The SNP rs187842643 lies within a noncoding RNA 177kb downstream of BASP1 (brain associated protein-1). We find that BASP1 expression is suppressed in melanoma as compared with benign nevi, providing additional evidence for a putative role in melanoma pathogenesis.	 26892652 18563784 21926416 26237428 25919928 21116649 17496320 16243793 25705849 20616382 20519635 19710684 23815297 19887512 11752295 19956849 21983787 26601858 21738487 23990928
28187132	GWAS for serum galactose-deficient IgA1 implicates critical genes of the O-glycosylation pathway.	Aberrant O-glycosylation of serum immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) represents a heritable pathogenic defect in IgA nephropathy, the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide, but specific genetic factors involved in its determination are not known. We performed a quantitative GWAS for serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in 2,633 subjects of European and East Asian ancestry and discovered two genome-wide significant loci, in C1GALT1 (rs13226913, P = 3.2 x 10-11) and C1GALT1C1 (rs5910940, P = 2.7 x 10-8). These genes encode molecular partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1. We demonstrated that these two loci explain approximately 7% of variability in circulating Gd-IgA1 in Europeans, but only 2% in East Asians. Notably, the Gd-IgA1-increasing allele of rs13226913 is common in Europeans, but rare in East Asians. Moreover, rs13226913 represents a strong cis-eQTL for C1GALT1 that encodes the key enzyme responsible for the transfer of galactose to O-linked glycans on IgA1. By in vitro siRNA knock-down studies, we confirmed that mRNA levels of both C1GALT1 and C1GALT1C1 determine the rate of secretion of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-producing cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of O-glycosylation and are relevant not only to IgA nephropathy, but also to other complex traits associated with O-glycosylation defects, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disease, and cancer.	 23782616 22684628 18321884 26376134 19455578 16510764 18272841 15772666 22064851 25479423 16251947 24912389 25118277 21249183 24662098 18300295 18846228 20694011 19684571 22737082 11231363 26007630 20616382 24676358 27313232 21326171 19557189 19098027 23382691 22446964 19478457 12464682 24159078 22067443 23715323 18172551 17342176 17062753 11532091 21383503 20689656 21685059 24507773 22673888 21399633 16238683 22904352 22864923 17701901 25305756 25707804 24398680 26028593 26258848 22808956 11754464 20601685 10393701 24013639
28194004	Genetic contributions to self-reported tiredness.	Self-reported tiredness and low energy, often called fatigue, are associated with poorer physical and mental health. Twin studies have indicated that this has a heritability between 6 and 50%.

28193307	Heritability and GWAS Studies for Monocyte-Lymphocyte Ratio.	The monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) is a useful biomarker for disease development, but little is known about the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence MLR variation. Here, we study the genetic architecture of MLR and determine the influence of demographic and lifestyle factors on MLR in data from a Dutch non-patient twin-family population. Data were obtained in 9,501 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register. We used regression analyses to determine the effects of age, sex, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) on MLR and its subcomponents. Data on twins, siblings and parents (N = 7,513) were analyzed by genetic structural equation modeling to establish heritability and genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a genotyped subsample (N = 5,892) and used to estimate heritability explained by SNPs. SNP and phenotype data were also analyzed in a genome-wide association study to identify the genes involved in MLR. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were performed to further explore the genetic findings. Results showed that age, sex, and age × sex interaction effects were present for MLR and its subcomponents. Variation in MLR was not related to BMI, but smoking was positively associated with MLR. Heritability was estimated at 40% for MLR, 58% for monocyte, and 58% for lymphocyte count. The Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a locus on ITGA4 that was associated with MLR and only marginally significantly associated with monocyte count. For monocyte count, additional genetic variants were identified on ITPR3, LPAP1, and IRF8. For lymphocyte count, GWAS provided no significant findings. Taking all measured SNPs together, their effects accounted for 13% of the heritability of MLR, while all known and identified genetic loci explained 1.3% of variation in MLR. eQTL analyses showed that these genetic variants were unlikely to be eQTLs. In conclusion, variation in MLR level in the general population is heritable and influenced by age, sex, and smoking. We identified gene variants in the ITGA4 gene associated with variation in MLR. The significant SNP-heritability indicates that more genetic variants are likely to be involved.	
28196072	Genetic prediction of male pattern baldness.	Male pattern baldness can have substantial psychosocial effects, and it has been phenotypically linked to adverse health outcomes such as prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease. We explored the genetic architecture of the trait using data from over 52,000 male participants of UK Biobank, aged 40-69 years. We identified over 250 independent genetic loci associated with severe hair loss (P<5x10-8). By splitting the cohort into a discovery sample of 40,000 and target sample of 12,000, we developed a prediction algorithm based entirely on common genetic variants that discriminated (AUC = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.74, specificity = 0.69, PPV = 59%, NPV = 82%) those with no hair loss from those with severe hair loss. The results of this study might help identify those at greatest risk of hair loss, and also potential genetic targets for intervention.	 9582072 1188424 20561779 20562875 23128226 22693459 10583042 23701444 26508577 26001114 25597830 25642630 19713490 22032556 12015971 25550326 25885710 17572673 23209562 14675213 7923352 15902657 27798627 18208984 26843402 25722852 22584901 17847007 24408308 25225425 16162033 25602953 19896111 27182965 26414678 21414208 14819896 18288204 25150481 11371349 26926045 25826379 12050096 16307704 24989505 24376213 19482600 10331973 18385763 15365985 21750109 16127116 26764224 23623388 22824790 18849991 27046643
28203683	Identification of unique venous thromboembolism-susceptibility variants in African-Americans.	To identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in African-Americans (AAs), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of VTE in AAs using the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, comprised of seven sites each with DNA biobanks (total ~39,200 unique DNA samples) with genome-wide SNP data (imputed to 1000 Genomes Project cosmopolitan reference panel) and linked to electronic health records (EHRs). Using a validated EHR-driven phenotype extraction algorithm, we identified VTE cases and controls and tested for an association between each SNP and VTE using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, stroke, site-platform combination and sickle cell risk genotype. Among 393 AA VTE cases and 4,941 AA controls, three intragenic SNPs reached genome-wide significance: LEMD3 rs138916004 (OR=3.2; p=1.3E-08), LY86 rs3804476 (OR=1.8; p=2E-08) and LOC100130298 rs142143628 (OR=4.5; p=4.4E-08); all three SNPs validated using internal cross-validation, parametric bootstrap and meta-analysis methods. LEMD3 rs138916004 and LOC100130298 rs142143628 are only present in Africans (1000G data). LEMD3 showed a significant differential expression in both NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Mayo Clinic gene expression data, LOC100130298 showed a significant differential expression only in the GEO expression data, and LY86 showed a significant differential expression only in the Mayo expression data. LEMD3 encodes for an antagonist of TGF-β-induced cell proliferation arrest. LY86 encodes for MD-1 which down-regulates the pro-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide; LY86 variation was previously associated with VTE in white women; LOC100130298 is a non-coding RNA gene with unknown regulatory activity in gene expression and epigenetics.	 17194218 18988794 26888256 15099278 16862161 22384356 24813864 21269473 19738031 22125226 21463476 26076949 7475606 18201862 19712457 22101192 12859034 15102017 25684211 23743551 23348971 22253303 21234875 23360712 24551388 21981779 10671519 16646809 9440395 25027141 19303496 20384625 17409269 15601644 23779087 22672568 17701901 23269371 16581406 9851733 22226817 25772935 20362271 21232005 21597104 24402195 19543373 25368172
28334899	Association analyses of East Asian individuals and trans-ancestry analyses with European individuals reveal new loci associated with cholesterol and triglyceride levels.	Large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >175 loci associated with fasting cholesterol levels, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). With differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and allele frequencies between ancestry groups, studies in additional large samples may detect new associations. We conducted staged GWAS meta-analyses in up to 69,414 East Asian individuals from 24 studies with participants from Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. These meta-analyses identified (P < 5 × 10-8) three novel loci associated with HDL-C near CD163-APOBEC1 (P = 7.4 × 10-9), NCOA2 (P = 1.6 × 10-8), and NID2-PTGDR (P = 4.2 × 10-8), and one novel locus associated with TG near WDR11-FGFR2 (P = 2.7 × 10-10). Conditional analyses identified a second signal near CD163-APOBEC1. We then combined results from the East Asian meta-analysis with association results from up to 187,365 European individuals from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium in a trans-ancestry meta-analysis. This analysis identified (log10Bayes Factor ≥6.1) eight additional novel lipid loci. Among the twelve total loci identified, the index variants at eight loci have demonstrated at least nominal significance with other metabolic traits in prior studies, and two loci exhibited coincident eQTLs (P < 1 × 10-5) in subcutaneous adipose tissue for BPTF and PDGFC. Taken together, these analyses identified multiple novel lipid loci, providing new potential therapeutic targets.	 4337382 20858683 25693563 28257690 26432245 24500759 17139284 21378990 23063622 25751400 22125221 25954002 24023260 26261634 24507774 23555291 22171074 26690388 24760767 17572673 24013639 18462017 8824235 20686565 26780889 24105470 22822086 20616382 8521507 19200528 24386095 27398621 23106963 21873549 21035760 25961943 27286809 16423883 23406875 20383146 15179446 24509480 21258325 16459312 7621302 21058334 15528449 25338720 20139978 17701901 21195347 25673412 22426310 24097068 27321945 12915450 12538434 10753843 21909115 25673413 21909109 18396371 16192269 22885922 20081857 23899561 23086419 20081858 25096241 25954001 26744325
28177523	Association between genetic variation within vitamin D receptor-DNA binding sites and risk of basal cell carcinoma.	An increasing number of studies have reported a protective association between vitamin D and cancer risk. The vitamin D endocrine system regulates transcriptional programs involved in inflammation, cell growth and differentiation through the binding of vitamin D receptor (VDR) to specific VDR elements. However, limited attention has been given to the role of variation within VDR binding sites in the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Across 2,776 previously identified VDR binding sites, we identified 2,540 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and examined their associations with BCC risk in a genome-wide association meta-analysis totaling 17,187 BCC cases and 287,054 controls from two data sets. After multiple testing corrections, we identified two SNPs at new loci (rs16917546 at 10q21.1: odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, p = 3.16 × 10

28649644	Constitutional variants are not associated with HER2-positive breast cancer: results from the SIGNAL/PHARE clinical cohort.	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer is a subtype of interest regarding its outcome and the impressive impact of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 targeted therapy. Constitutional variants may be involved in the aetiology of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer, and we propose a case-case study to test the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms may be associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. A Genome-Wide Association Study was used in a cohort of 9836 patients from the SIGNAL/PHARE study (NCT00381901-RECF1098). The main goal was to identify variants specifically related to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. A two-staged genotyping strategy was carried out to cover as large a proportion of the genome as possible. All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore Exome chip set.

We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with carotid plaque and to examine the potential shared genetic basis with CAD.	
28232668	Genome-wide analyses of non-syndromic cleft lip with palate identify 14 novel loci and genetic heterogeneity.	Non-syndromic cleft lip with palate (NSCLP) is the most serious sub-phenotype of non-syndromic orofacial clefts (NSOFC), which are the most common craniofacial birth defects in humans. Here we conduct a GWAS of NSCLP with multiple independent replications, totalling 7,404 NSOFC cases and 16,059 controls from several ethnicities, to identify new NSCLP risk loci, and explore the genetic heterogeneity between sub-phenotypes of NSOFC. We identify 41 SNPs within 26 loci that achieve genome-wide significance, 14 of which are novel (RAD54B, TMEM19, KRT18, WNT9B, GSC/DICER1, PTCH1, RPS26, OFCC1/TFAP2A, TAF1B, FGF10, MSX1, LINC00640, FGFR1 and SPRY1). These 26 loci collectively account for 10.94% of the heritability for NSCLP in Chinese population. We find evidence of genetic heterogeneity between the sub-phenotypes of NSOFC and among different populations. This study substantially increases the number of genetic susceptibility loci for NSCLP and provides important insights into the genetic aetiology of this common craniofacial malformation.	 7914451 26463473 24859337 21921199 17981355 16862161 10226010 20023658 26046797 19032739 23900075 25373698 23716939 12627230 19779022 23449973 25775280 27033726 24607185 24942156 20944595 22461561 21205968 17360555 23512105 21164525 18836445 19656524 15218257 26968009 19131313 18718930 25642632 22955616 21331089 27018472 20091798 23728348 23897749 24783654 22863734 20459789 16076837 24124047 19747722 19838193 19270707 17701901 20436469 24290375 20194897 22508319 21167468 25673413 15368555 15824545 16998816 12514106 15199404 27018475 21536720 25786657 21045058
28240269	Connecting genetic risk to disease end points through the human blood plasma proteome.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with intermediate phenotypes, like changes in metabolite and protein levels, provide functional evidence to map disease associations and translate them into clinical applications. However, although hundreds of genetic variants have been associated with complex disorders, the underlying molecular pathways often remain elusive. Associations with intermediate traits are key in establishing functional links between GWAS-identified risk-variants and disease end points. Here we describe a GWAS using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. We quantify 539 associations between protein levels and gene variants (pQTLs) in a German cohort and replicate over half of them in an Arab and Asian cohort. Fifty-five of the replicated pQTLs are located in trans. Our associations overlap with 57 genetic risk loci for 42 unique disease end points. We integrate this information into a genome-proteome network and provide an interactive web-tool for interrogations. Our results provide a basis for novel approaches to pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications.	 23692858 26287746 27444932 19474294 9458099 24700089 18464913 27918535 23300138 25868665 18003641 22421340 26542006 22595970 24037378 22740183 23733883 16032514 25123647 9895338 20147318 22789536 17952072 17170373 11841245 18448073 25087611 26039989 25722852 24135908 22446960 20179311 10622723 12860908 26907721 26352407 26035255 25652787 24352655 23946506 11950700 20224550 21751362 24816436 24816252 21743469 22022604 24023061 17395855 20037589 16407218 23032255 24768341 24119446 24439387 21886157 24014485 21165148 24248368 25147954 23894628 24121966 25060516 25431330 23487758 20562413 23676674 20103627 22672667 23868113 24262325 24423354
28334792	GWAS identifies population-specific new regulatory variants in FUT6 associated with plasma B12 concentrations in Indians.	Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in one-carbon metabolism whose dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions. Indians have a high prevalence of B12 deficiency but little is known about the genetic determinants of circulating B12 concentrations in Indians. We performed a genome-wide association study in 1001 healthy participants in the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS), replication studies in 3418 individuals from other Indian cohorts and by meta-analysis identified new variants, rs3760775 (P = 1.2 × 10-23) and rs78060698 (P = 8.3 × 10-17) in FUT6 to be associated with circulating B12 concentrations. Although in-silico analysis replicated both variants in Europeans, differences in the effect allele frequency, effect size and the linkage disequilibrium structure of credible set variants with the reported variants suggest population-specific characteristics in this region. We replicated previously reported variants rs602662, rs601338 in FUT2, rs3760776, rs708686 in FUT6, rs34324219 in TCN1 (all P < 5 × 10-8), rs1131603 in TCN2 (P = 3.4 × 10-5), rs12780845 in CUBN (P = 3.0 × 10-3) and rs2270655 in MMAA (P = 2.0 × 10-3). Circulating B12 concentrations in the PMNS and Parthenon study showed a significant decline with increasing age (P < 0.001), however, the genetic contribution to B12 concentrations remained constant. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic-mobility shift assay for the FUT6 variant rs78060698 using HepG2 cell line demonstrated strong allele-specific promoter and enhancer activity and differential binding of HNF4α, a key regulator of expression of various fucosyltransferases. Hence, the rs78060698 variant, through regulation of fucosylation may control intestinal host-microbial interaction which could influence B12 concentrations. Our results suggest that in addition to established genetic variants, population-specific variants are important in determining plasma B12 concentrations.	 10448523 25417156 24843588 19744961 26432245 11470726 19343610 23754956 17851649 18776911 22254022 24473328 22089603 25440056 16973733 22064851 19439916 12045153 17972060 25274297 25918370 20305127 24196873 19707742 17572673 19763151 25052622 10448529 25332324 23785302 24194598 26551672 11782049 22491358 24609067 17214273 20237569 12882927 15297300 25677713 20598278 26139635 22367966 20634204 7354869 17701901 18274891 23104008 11285330 12651883 21203500 19165915 22547309 22661206 9358143 1176445 26637976 8175676 19303062 11581259

28334814	Genome-wide association study identifies novel susceptible loci and highlights Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the development of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.	The genetic architecture of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains poorly understood. Here we present the result of a 4-stage genome-wide association study composed of 5,953 AIS patients and 8,137 controls. Overall, we identified three novel susceptible loci including rs7593846 at 2p14 near MEIS1 (Pcombined = 1.19 × 10-13, OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10-1.32), rs7633294 at 3p14.1 near MAGI1 (Pcombined = 1.85 × 10-12, OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.09-1.32), and rs9810566 at 3q26.2 near TNIK (Pcombined = 1.14 × 10-11, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.08-1.32). We also confirmed a recently reported region associated with AIS at 20p11.22 (Pcombined = 1.61 × 10-15, OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.12-1.34). Furthermore, we observed significantly asymmetric expression of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the bilateral paraspinal muscle of AIS patients, including beta-catenin, TNIK, and LBX1. This is the first study that unveils the potential role of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the development of AIS, and our findings may shed new light on the etiopathogenesis of AIS.

Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

28273873	Interaction between Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Urinary Sodium, Potassium, and Sodium-Potassium Ratio on the Risk of Hypertension in Korean Adults.	Hypertension is a complex disease explained with diverse factors including environmental factors and genetic factors. The objectives of this study were to determine the interaction effects between gene variants and 24 h estimated urinary sodium and potassium excretion and sodium-potassium excretion ratios on the risk of hypertension. A total of 8839 participants were included in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find genetic factors associated with hypertension. Tanaka and Kawasaki formulas were applied to estimate 24 h urinary sodium and potassium excretion. A total of 4414 participants were included in interaction analyses to identify the interaction effects of gene variants according to 24 h estimated urinary factors on the risk of hypertension. CSK rs1378942 and CSK-MIR4513 rs3784789 were significantly modified by urinary sodium-potassium excretion ratio. In addition, MKLN rs1643270 with urinary potassium excretion, LOC101929750 rs7554672 with urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and TENM4 rs10466739 with urinary sodium-potassium excretion ratio showed significant interaction effects. The present study results indicated that the mutant alleles of CSK rs1378942 and CSK-MIR4513 rs3784789 had the strongest protective effects against hypertension in the middle group of 24 h estimated urinary sodium-potassium excretion ratio. Further studies are needed to replicate these analyses in other populations.	 23759979 8522721 21963141 21228780 23036851 3521337 19424278 25119607 26902492 20147969 10543724 25398734 16291816 22959498 14681826 25119606 7507203 22525200 23079715 17572673 21796221 19430479 25385345 24001895 25353661 25618516 23727086 11463760 23591986 24975945 19888460 21633377 23079679 8890164 11136953 21045733 26039623 15531692 20479155 11288814 23558163 23558162 16772636 25789451 25249183 11369175 22110105 25275628 24142389 9168293 23082128 17554300 22100073 16267090 21378095 9288116 20542020 8432042 16452157 9016780 23611811 11850766 19396169 19960030 20852445 22322875 17911601 20090362 22229515 22071413 8321072 25826317 24642721 20414254
28262088	Genome-Wide Association Study of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Two High-Risk Populations.	Mexican Americans (MAs) and American Indians (AIs) constitute conspicuously understudied groups with respect to risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), especially in light of findings showing racial/ethnic differences in trauma exposure and risk for PTSD. The purpose of this study was to examine genetic influences on PTSD in two minority cohorts. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) with sum PTSD symptoms for trauma-exposed subjects was run in each cohort. Six highly correlated variants in olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily L member 1 (OR11L1) were suggestively associated with PTSD in the MA cohort. These associations remained suggestively significant after permutation testing. A signal in a nearby olfactory receptor on chromosome 1, olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily L member 13 (OR2L13), tagged by rs151319968, was nominally associated with PTSD in the AI sample. Although no variants were significantly associated after correction for multiple testing in a meta-analysis of the two cohorts, pathway analysis of the top hits showed an enrichment cluster of terms related to sensory transduction, olfactory receptor activity, G-protein coupled receptors, and membrane. As previous studies have proposed a role for olfaction in PTSD, our results indicate this influence may be partially driven by genetic variation in the olfactory system.	 15630077 24473328 23102628 25456346 25845746 21460063 4030702 12499305 12359672 23159328 17903334 25431634 16187777 8189735 19033363 22143225 24226308 17716068 10838673 27569652 22869035 23567521 20346193 8466386 25722852 20079770 16135633 10762547 26114229 8184996 21478889 19968392 10739422 27167565 24103155 17540456 24479562 12013069 17128961 23726511 17285093 20634204 17701901 9356568 21054919 23135256 19451168 21167468 19131956 12633130 24739678 24080187 15855465 18834274 20601685 25527893 10615721 10890822

28265120	A genome-wide gene-by-trauma interaction study of alcohol misuse in two independent cohorts identifies PRKG1 as a risk locus.	Traumatic life experiences are associated with alcohol use problems, an association that is likely to be moderated by genetic predisposition. To understand these interactions, we conducted a gene-by-environment genome-wide interaction study (GEWIS) of alcohol use problems in two independent samples, the Army STARRS (STARRS, N=16 361) and the Yale-Penn (N=8084) cohorts. Because the two cohorts were assessed using different instruments, we derived separate dimensional alcohol misuse scales and applied a proxy-phenotype study design. In African-American subjects, we identified an interaction of PRKG1 rs1729578 with trauma exposure in the STARRS cohort and replicated its interaction with trauma exposure in the Yale-Penn cohort (discovery-replication meta-analysis: z=5.64, P=1.69 × 10	 24865195 27046646 19089345 25693563 23703215 24387979 23136350 24929224 24135711 25555482 23709024 24332924 23672542 25828809 23045644 9242616 21097501 24143882 19109502 26361201 25444161 17590536 26592203 22955616 15995696 15769627 20616382 24925903 25722852 25201988 19156199 26114229 27196697 23894150 26458734 27531626 25951043 27065929 27167565 24166409 18832566 23958962 27439997 15297906 20595427 27187070 20040588 27028160 26267224 25410943 17123474 15896927 26657631 23630272 24287333

28346442	Identification of 12 new susceptibility loci for different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.	To identify common alleles associated with different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we pooled data from multiple genome-wide genotyping projects totaling 25,509 EOC cases and 40,941 controls. We identified nine new susceptibility loci for different EOC histotypes: six for serous EOC histotypes (3q28, 4q32.3, 8q21.11, 10q24.33, 18q11.2 and 22q12.1), two for mucinous EOC (3q22.3 and 9q31.1) and one for endometrioid EOC (5q12.3). We then performed meta-analysis on the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified three additional susceptibility loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31. Integrated analyses of genes and regulatory biofeatures at each locus predicted candidate susceptibility genes, including OBFC1, a new candidate susceptibility gene for low-grade and borderline serous EOC.	 19805447 26045974 22532805 27601076 19087329 17668372 23544012 26231222 23128226 24777667 20852632 23544013 18252211 23374354 24316577 26961892 24943595 20852633 20616382 26424751 19648919 19275939 23535730 21720365 26075790 26025000 23535731 27432226 20852631 21499239 22322322 23240669 25952785 25226589 26272984 25804953 26226460 24277755 17908964 26398868 22714938 27697780 22492648 19648609 22555104 23535648 23535649 21997682 23396013 25581431

28355295	Risk prediction of pulmonary tuberculosis using genetic and conventional risk factors in adult Korean population.	A complex interplay among host, pathogen, and environmental factors is believed to contribute to the risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The lack of replication of published genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings limits the clinical utility of reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted a GWAS using 467 PTB cases and 1,313 healthy controls obtained from two community-based cohorts in Korea. We evaluated the performance of PTB risk models based on different combinations of genetic and nongenetic factors and validated the results in an independent Korean population comprised of 179 PTB cases and 500 healthy controls. We demonstrated the polygenic nature of PTB and nongenetic factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were strongly associated with PTB risk. None of the SNPs achieved genome-wide significance; instead, we were able to replicate the associations between PTB and ten SNPs near or in the genes, CDCA7, GBE1, GADL1, SPATA16, C6orf118, KIAA1432, DMRT2, CTR9, CCDC67, and CDH13, which may play roles in the immune and inflammatory pathways. Among the replicated SNPs, an intergenic SNP, rs9365798, located downstream of the C6orf118 gene showed the most significant association under the dominant model (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.32-1.92, P = 2.1×10-6). The performance of a risk model combining the effects of ten replicated SNPs and six nongenetic factors (i.e., age, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin) were validated in the replication set (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.84). The strategy of combining genetic and nongenetic risk factors ultimately resulted in better risk prediction for PTB in the adult Korean population.	 27017310 25774636 26264962 26829749 27140283 21420161 23716474 26806298 23425167 22610074 23555274 19715440 17592104 21330400 26210231 16108831 24821915 22134068 22239941 23455638 25595711 22028674 20946665 23020818 20199642 21508110 17701901 24057671 22306650 19396169 19780822 21909109 19217374 21740661 22551897 20694014 25875811
28355232	A genome-wide trans-ethnic interaction study links the PIGR-FCAMR locus to coronary atherosclerosis via interactions between genetic variants and residential exposure to traffic.	Air pollution is a worldwide contributor to cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity. Traffic-related air pollution is a widespread environmental exposure and is associated with multiple cardiovascular outcomes such as coronary atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarction. Despite the recognition of the importance of both genetic and environmental exposures to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, studies of how these two contributors operate jointly are rare. We performed a genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) to examine gene-traffic exposure interactions associated with coronary atherosclerosis. Using race-stratified cohorts of 538 African-Americans (AA) and 1562 European-Americans (EA) from a cardiac catheterization cohort (CATHGEN), we identify gene-by-traffic exposure interactions associated with the number of significantly diseased coronary vessels as a measure of chronic atherosclerosis. We found five suggestive (P<1x10-5) interactions in the AA GWIS, of which two (rs1856746 and rs2791713) replicated in the EA cohort (P < 0.05). Both SNPs are in the PIGR-FCAMR locus and are eQTLs in lymphocytes. The protein products of both PIGR and FCAMR are implicated in inflammatory processes. In the EA GWIS, there were three suggestive interactions; none of these replicated in the AA GWIS. All three were intergenic; the most significant interaction was in a regulatory region associated with SAMSN1, a gene previously associated with atherosclerosis and B cell activation. In conclusion, we have uncovered several novel genes associated with coronary atherosclerosis in individuals chronically exposed to increased ambient concentrations of traffic air pollution. These genes point towards inflammatory pathways that may modify the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular disease risk.	 19194299 26540294 25807578 27233746 3917857 22569581 15803198 16862161 24098343 18673543 22223662 26343387 24452269 19022827 23482648 23245609 25954002 16866880 27082954 11125122 27804220 11536050 19604064 26271459 15381729 22491084 20616382 22053820 19341499 23245604 17638927 23202125 18091421 22524595 22607863 15156526 12676598 15855047 22409835 26613345 12269664 20458016 26502339 11779189 20173117 26149207 27789446 21414469 21738159 25954001

28358823	Genome-wide association screens for Achilles tendon and ACL tears and tendinopathy.	Achilles tendinopathy or rupture and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture are substantial injuries affecting athletes, associated with delayed recovery or inability to return to competition. To identify genetic markers that might be used to predict risk for these injuries, we performed genome-wide association screens for these injuries using data from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort consisting of 102,979 individuals. We did not find any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with either of these injuries with a p-value that was genome-wide significant (p<5x10-8). We found, however, four and three polymorphisms with p-values that were borderline significant (p<10-6) for Achilles tendon injury and ACL rupture, respectively. We then tested SNPs previously reported to be associated with either Achilles tendon injury or ACL rupture. None showed an association in our cohort with a false discovery rate of less than 5%. We obtained, however, moderate to weak evidence for replication in one case; specifically, rs4919510 in MIR608 had a p-value of 5.1x10-3 for association with Achilles tendon injury, corresponding to a 7% chance of false replication. Finally, we tested 2855 SNPs in 90 candidate genes for musculoskeletal injury, but did not find any that showed a significant association below a false discovery rate of 5%. We provide data containing summary statistics for the entire genome, which will be useful for future genetic studies on these injuries.	 19443461 19193663 22742074 17473005 25642630 23347277 24879018 26092718 22057989 23491141 26686553 22253303 24744467 23192621 26060338 21410539 20360039 18443036 24661680 23371043 26414676 20598278 19042922 19075007 25429546 23168334 16430677 25640225 24862178 24552666 22588838 21490505 18353721 8948254 21565264 20234392 15983124 19933162 21903159 18669982 18063176
28199695	GWAS of self-reported mosquito bite size, itch intensity and attractiveness to mosquitoes implicates immune-related predisposition loci.	Understanding the interaction between humans and mosquitoes is a critical area of study due to the phenomenal burdens on public health from mosquito-transmitted diseases. In this study, we conducted the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of self-reported mosquito bite reaction size (n = 84,724), itchiness caused by bites (n = 69,057), and perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes (n = 16,576). In total, 15 independent significant (P < 5×10-8) associations were identified. These loci were enriched for immunity-related genes that are involved in multiple cytokine signalling pathways. We also detected suggestive enrichment of these loci in enhancer regions that are active in stimulated T-cells, as well as within loci previously identified as controlling central memory T-cell levels. Egger regression analysis between the traits suggests that perception of itchiness and attractiveness to mosquitoes is driven, at least in part, by the genetic determinants of bite reaction size.Our findings illustrate the complex genetic and immunological landscapes underpinning human interactions with mosquitoes.	 17620829 26808494 21858135 12930761 8087654 24243840 22223662 21001941 9235946 19124715 25642630 19684581 22064851 17160889 18940858 26482879 22036096 20585627 15719167 24316577 24238038 22509285 22493691 11978138 22216154 16200082 25172491 7985763 24390342 12234522 24074872 26476454 9646849 19075398 17044878 21102463 23817571 26414676 10837078 16547250 26193341 19819109 24816252 18306972 10962477 23875801 25391959 16998491 25338720 19838193 9693276 17924348 15528444 10081770 23603761 25225667 14963366 23817569 22057235 19493208 23472185 20981092 23688850 20457114 25901606 22373907 19788800 26050253 15474865 22197932 15778349 26657631 7679483 20189939 17558408

28388302	Genome-Wide Association and Replication Study of Hepatotoxicity Induced by Antiretrovirals Alone or with Concomitant Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs.	Drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH) is a common adverse event that is associated with both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATD). Moreover, the genetic variations predisposing ARV- and ARV-ATD-induced liver toxicity in African populations are not well investigated, despite the two diseases being the major global health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication study to identify the genetic variants linked to the risk of developing DIH due to ARV drugs alone, and ARV-ATD co-treatment in Ethiopian HIV-positive patients. Treatment-naïve newly diagnosed HIV patients (n = 719) with or without tuberculosis (TB) co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based ARV therapy with or without rifampicin-based short course ATD, respectively. Whole-genome genotyping was performed by using the Illumina Omni Express Exome Bead Chip genotyping array with 951,117 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a total of 41 cases of DIH, and 452 people without DIH (treatment tolerants). The replication study was carried out for 100 SNPs with the lowest p-values (top SNPs) by using an independent cohort consisting of 18 DIH cases and 208 treatment tolerants.

28207573	Genome-wide analysis of clopidogrel active metabolite levels identifies novel variants that influence antiplatelet response.	Clopidogrel is one of the most commonly used therapeutics for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, considerable interindividual variation in clopidogrel response has been documented, resulting in suboptimal therapy and an increased risk of recurrent events for some patients. In this investigation, we carried out the first genome-wide association study of circulating clopidogrel active metabolite levels in 513 healthy participants to directly measure clopidogrel pharmacokinetics. We observed that the CYP2C19 locus was the strongest genetic determinant of active metabolite formation (P=9.5×10). In addition, we identified novel genome-wide significant variants on chromosomes 3p25 (rs187941554, P=3.3×10) and 17q11 (rs80343429, P=1.3×10), as well as six additional loci that showed suggestive evidence of association (P≤1.0×10). Four of these loci showed nominal associations with on-clopidogrel ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation (P≤0.05). Evaluation of clopidogrel active metabolite concentration may help identify novel genetic determinants of clopidogrel response, which has implications for the development of novel therapeutics and improved antiplatelet treatment for at-risk patients in the future.	 24127209 23686351 19706858 23392654 22169056 23056288 18829199 26374108 20517286 15837243 24848981 23715323 26168254 22281261 25653097 17088979 23111421 26362473 19543373 19074352 18193644

28406950	Interaction of iron status with single nucleotide polymorphisms on incidence of type 2 diabetes.	The objective of this study is to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Korean adults and to investigate the longitudinal association between these SNPs and T2D and the interaction effects of iron intake and average hemoglobin level. Data from the KoGES_Ansan and Ansung Study were used. Gene-iron interaction analysis was conducted using a two-step approach. To select candidate SNPs associated with T2D, a total of 7,935 adults at baseline were included in genome-wide association analysis (step one). After excluding T2D prevalent cases, prospective analyses were conducted with 7,024 adults aged 40-69 (step two). The association of selected SNPs and iron status with T2D and their interaction were determined using a Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 3 SNPs [rs9465871 (CDKAL1), rs10761745 (JMJD1C), and rs163177 (KCNQ1)] were selected as candidate SNPs related to T2D. Among them, rs10761745 (JMJD1C) and rs163177 (KCNQ1) were prospectively associated with T2D. High iron intake was also prospectively associated with the risk of T2D after adjusting for covariates. Average hemoglobin level was positively associated with T2D after adjusting for covariates in women. We also found significant interaction effects between rs10761745 (JMJD1C) and average hemoglobin levels on the risk of T2D among women with normal inflammation and without anemia at baseline. In conclusion, KCNQ1 and JMJD1C may prospectively contribute to the risk of T2D incidence among adults over the age of 40 and JMJD1C, but CDKAL1 may not, and iron status may interactively contribute to T2D incidence in women.	 20518947 16306377 10064092 22829776 20660052 9760147 18227363 10201801 24327370 20161779 16537739 23742704 9356019 24158761 12663437 26054392 23046549 21989113 9683388 19896746 24843659 19936222 1511065 17460697 18711367 19112455 14550627 19915463 18940312 18711366 17554300 17804762 16267090 16873796 22936694 18633108 18544707 23133642 20182862 18501198 23386860 19396169 19306073 22079683 17299477 24101783 12145144 26406982
28437668	Genome-wide association study of treatment response to venlafaxine XR in generalized anxiety disorder.	We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) to identify potential predictors of venlafaxine XR treatment outcome. Ninety-eight European American patients participated in a venlafaxine XR clinical trial for GAD, with Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) response/remission at 24 weeks as the primary outcome measure. All participants were genotyped with the Illumina PsychChip, and 266,820 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide significance, 8 SNPs were marginally associated with treatment response/remission and HAM-A reduction at week 12 and 24 (p<0.00001).

28416818	Large-scale analyses of common and rare variants identify 12 new loci associated with atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation affects more than 33 million people worldwide and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death. Fourteen genetic loci have been associated with atrial fibrillation in European and Asian ancestry groups. To further define the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation, we performed large-scale, trans-ancestry meta-analyses of common and rare variant association studies. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) included 17,931 individuals with atrial fibrillation and 115,142 referents; the exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) involved 22,346 cases and 132,086 referents. We identified 12 new genetic loci that exceeded genome-wide significance, implicating genes involved in cardiac electrical and structural remodeling. Our results nearly double the number of known genetic loci for atrial fibrillation, provide insights into the molecular basis of atrial fibrillation, and may facilitate the identification of new potential targets for drug discovery.	 25523945 27068588 22699862 24685669 20173747 25597830 25807286 19192299 21378987 25259869 22064851 27374138 22544366 24316577 11125122 18300295 25316677 19597492 25124494 26935894 18200594 19837132 20616382 23715323 24561134 22955989 24345399 20634204 15313941 17701901 18348202 22426310 25431330 24739678 26121088 17603472 15710328
28416822	Identification of six new genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation in the Japanese population.	Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and leads to stroke. To investigate genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation in the Japanese population, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included 8,180 atrial fibrillation cases and 28,612 controls with follow-up in an additional 3,120 cases and 125,064 controls. We replicated previously reported loci and identified six new loci, near the KCND3, PPFIA4, SLC1A4-CEP68, HAND2, NEBL and SH3PXD2A genes. Five of the six new loci were specifically associated with atrial fibrillation in the Japanese population after comparing our data to those from individuals of European ancestry, suggesting that there might be different genetic factors affecting susceptibility across ancestry groups. Our study discovered variants in the HAND2, KCND3 and NEBL genes, which are relevant to atrial fibrillation susceptibility. The involvement of PPFIA4 and SH3PXD2A in axon guidance also suggested a role in disease pathogenesis. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of atrial fibrillation susceptibility and pathogenesis.	 23985323 19008477 23400760 20173747 11076755 21374718 23963749 15199036 24103419 27374138 22544366 23280838 23632046 19597492 26189493 25124494 11822876 20951326 18691774 6852374 20733104 25564649 24965079 15052270 26321576 21407268 18348202 17357068 20714348 15750591 17603472 25854634 23280837
28416812	A new locus regulating MICALL2 expression was identified for association with executive inhibition in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	Impaired executive inhibition is a core deficit of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is a common childhood-onset psychiatric disorder with high heritability. In this study, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study of executive inhibition in ADHD in Han Chinese. We used the Stroop color-word interference test to evaluate executive inhibition. After quality control, 780 samples with phenotype and covariate data were included in the discovery stage, whereas 922 samples were included in the replication stage. We identified one new significant locus at 7p22.3 for the Stroop word interference time (rs11514810, P=3.42E-09 for discovery, P=0.01176 for replication and combined P=5.249E-09). Regulatory feature analysis and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data showed that this locus contributes to MICALL2 expression in the human brain. Most genes in the network interacting with MICALL2 were associated with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, hyperactive-impulsive-like behavior was induced by reducing the expression of the zebrafish gene that is homologous to MICALL2, which could be rescued by tomoxetine (atomoxetine), a clinical medication for ADHD. Our results suggested that MICALL2 is a new susceptibility gene for executive inhibition deficiency related to hyperactive-impulsive behavior in ADHD, further emphasizing the possible role of neurodevelopmental genes in the pathogenic mechanism of ADHD.	 22955619 16887023 10945922 17194218 22420046 25174004 16525024 16862161 10822345 24603720 23128226 15076256 24097066 9276836 26428549 26395975 20424623 15950004 23071556 19715440 18261248 15930055 22012869 24166412 17344885 17585884 16774975 12110185 8655658 22080511 26503253 25037459 22067443 17350233 10073923 18369939 23728934 25586935 20576703 24261515 20732625 18413246 19506906 21177762 26042010 17701901 23074066 21848658 10069618 17541055 9000892 15535793 21205410 16197923 17325717 20008558 12925520
28424481	The first genome-wide association study identifying new susceptibility loci for obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome.	Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most important treatable cause of recurrent pregnancy loss. The live birth rate is limited to only 70-80% in patients with APS undergoing established anticoagulant therapy. Lupus anticoagulant (LA), but not anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), was found to predict adverse pregnancy outcome. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of APS focusing on aCL have shown that several molecules may be involved. This is the first GWAS for obstetric APS focusing on LA. A GWAS was performed to compare 115 Japanese patients with obstetric APS, diagnosed according to criteria of the International Congress on APS, and 419 healthy individuals. Allele or genotype frequencies were compared in a total of 426 344 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Imputation analyses were also performed for the candidate regions detected by the GWAS. One SNP (rs2288493) located on the 3'-UTR of TSHR showed an experiment-wide significant APS association (P=7.85E-08, OR=6.18) under a recessive model after Bonferroni correction considering the number of analyzed SNPs. Another SNP (rs79154414) located around the C1D showed a genome-wide significant APS association (P=4.84E-08, OR=6.20) under an allelic model after applying the SNP imputation. Our findings demonstrate that a specific genotype of TSHR and C1D genes can be a risk factor for obstetric APS.	 24943836 22661547 6146787 23649468 27454295 7507506 8363725 16106256 19249757 9022487 25707395 19151747 27098658 22291604 26429521 17804842 27030795 20822807 23000144 19165919 23509613 19180478 23715323 25672763 15148393 20407389 1595785 7550312 16420554 23407388 9405624 15749499 20634204 21558126 10728763 19605742 19820021 19644876 14967375 11102274 19838195 20112363 20979474 19543373 22275304 19338986
28425483	A genome-wide association study identifies six novel risk loci for primary biliary cholangitis.	Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease with a strong hereditary component. Here, we report a genome-wide association study that included 1,122 PBC cases and 4,036 controls of Han Chinese descent, with subsequent replication in a separate cohort of 907 PBC cases and 2,127 controls. Our results show genome-wide association of 14 PBC risk loci including previously identified 6p21 (HLA-DRA and DPB1), 17q12 (ORMDL3), 3q13.33 (CD80), 2q32.3 (STAT1/STAT4), 3q25.33 (IL12A), 4q24 (NF-κB) and 22q13.1 (RPL3/SYNGR1). We also identified variants in IL21, IL21R, CD28/CTLA4/ICOS, CD58, ARID3A and IL16 as novel PBC risk loci. These new findings and histochemical studies showing enhanced expression of IL21 and IL21R in PBC livers (particularly in the hepatic portal tracks) support a disease mechanism in which the deregulation of the IL21 signalling pathway, in addition to CD4 T-cell activation and T-cell co-stimulation are critical components in the development of PBC.	 16862161 19458352 19237575 21254185 25197060 15378793 22064851 22936693 19169255 25899471 19525955 19501929 15300581 19554543 20639880 25185498 19898481 23000144 21199920 19944401 23603763 15297300 18817904 23893766 24453414 26394269 25627620 20634204 26239551 20693344 17873874 21281812 22171328 25042122 22961000 21399635 25690649 18208329 19543373 25854761 24013639
28429243	SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and plasma estrone conjugates in postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer: genome-wide association studies of the estrone pathway.	Estrone (E1), the major circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women, promotes estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor growth and proliferation. Two major reactions contribute to E1 plasma concentrations, aromatase (CYP19A1) catalyzed E1 synthesis from androstenedione and steroid sulfatase (STS) catalyzed hydrolysis of estrone conjugates (E1Cs). E1Cs have been associated with breast cancer risk and may contribute to tumor progression since STS is expressed in breast cancer where its activity exceeds that of aromatase.	 7828527 8636351 26432245 9285694 22829776 8895749 15601642 17325027 11959894 21707867 22675492 20354183 15328376 16399356 9927050 22588260 21177793 19414484 11477075 21457551 2560511 12796390 15199113 7198170 18650507 25163006 12077320 23550210 22017816 16322344 24816252 25825511 7376217 8275973 17268815 6317235 3015631 10963623 27228187 17924348 18321482 22588877 17701901 26211827 5014608 16533785 21854228 23518928 25954001 21342037
28430825	Discovery and fine-mapping of adiposity loci using high density imputation of genome-wide association studies in individuals of African ancestry: African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >300 loci associated with measures of adiposity including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), but few have been identified through screening of the African ancestry genomes. We performed large scale meta-analyses and replications in up to 52,895 individuals for BMI and up to 23,095 individuals for WHRadjBMI from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC) using 1000 Genomes phase 1 imputed GWAS to improve coverage of both common and low frequency variants in the low linkage disequilibrium African ancestry genomes. In the sex-combined analyses, we identified one novel locus (TCF7L2/HABP2) for WHRadjBMI and eight previously established loci at P < 5×10-8: seven for BMI, and one for WHRadjBMI in African ancestry individuals. An additional novel locus (SPRYD7/DLEU2) was identified for WHRadjBMI when combined with European GWAS. In the sex-stratified analyses, we identified three novel loci for BMI (INTS10/LPL and MLC1 in men, IRX4/IRX2 in women) and four for WHRadjBMI (SSX2IP, CASC8, PDE3B and ZDHHC1/HSD11B2 in women) in individuals of African ancestry or both African and European ancestry. For four of the novel variants, the minor allele frequency was low (<5%). In the trans-ethnic fine mapping of 47 BMI loci and 27 WHRadjBMI loci that were locus-wide significant (P < 0.05 adjusted for effective number of variants per locus) from the African ancestry sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses, 26 BMI loci and 17 WHRadjBMI loci contained ≤ 20 variants in the credible sets that jointly account for 99% posterior probability of driving the associations. The lead variants in 13 of these loci had a high probability of being causal. As compared to our previous HapMap imputed GWAS for BMI and WHRadjBMI including up to 71,412 and 27,350 African ancestry individuals, respectively, our results suggest that 1000 Genomes imputation showed modest improvement in identifying GWAS loci including low frequency variants. Trans-ethnic meta-analyses further improved fine mapping of putative causal variants in loci shared between the African and European ancestry populations.	 23583978 24861553 24097068 27438680 23150689 23128226 22344219 22138821 17943122 23639740 19767754 15965027 24947352 22344221 24316577 19191728 26426971 26189819 20139324 18421276 20686565 22001403 22233810 25282103 16077740 20616382 20935630 24931982 20935629 18388900 20354512 19478016 24643338 20811451 24990607 25302443 21521824 24509480 23563607 22484627 20421936 23966867 21058334 25673412 22689647 21701570 25653097 26727116 22955989 22426310 21167468 27272580 25673413 17143332 12642576 26579801 25102180 22474126 20601685 19543373 17311894 11238910 11855950 26657631 26132169 25954001

28449029	A genome-wide association study identifies nucleotide variants at SIGLEC5 and DEFA1A3 as risk loci for periodontitis.	Periodontitis is one of the most common inflammatory diseases, with a prevalence of 11% worldwide for the severe forms and an estimated heritability of 50%. The disease is characterized by destruction of the alveolar bone due to an aberrant host inflammatory response to a dysbiotic oral microbiome. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported several suggestive susceptibility loci. Here, we conducted a GWAS using a German and Dutch case-control sample of aggressive periodontitis (AgP, 896 cases, 7,104 controls), a rare but highly severe and early-onset form of periodontitis, validated the associations in a German sample of severe forms of the more moderate phenotype chronic periodontitis (CP) (993 cases, 1,419 controls). Positive findings were replicated in a Turkish sample of AgP (223 cases, 564 controls). A locus at SIGLEC5 (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 5) and a chromosomal region downstream of the DEFA1A3 locus (defensin alpha 1-3) showed association with both disease phenotypes and were associated with periodontitis at a genome-wide significance level in the pooled samples, with P = 1.09E-08 (rs4284742,-G; OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.21-1.48) and P = 5.48E-10 (rs2738058,-T; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.18-1.38), respectively. SIGLEC5 is expressed in various myeloid immune cells and classified as an inhibitory receptor with the potential to mediate tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1/-2 dependent signaling. Alpha defensins are antimicrobial peptides with expression in neutrophils and mucosal surfaces and a role in phagocyte-mediated host defense. This study identifies the first shared genetic risk loci of AgP and CP with genome-wide significance and highlights the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the etiology of periodontitis.

28441456	Genome-wide association study of facial morphology reveals novel associations with FREM1 and PARK2.	Several studies have now shown evidence of association between common genetic variants and quantitative facial traits in humans. The reported associations generally involve simple univariate measures and likely represent only a small fraction of the genetic loci influencing facial morphology. In this study, we applied factor analysis to a set of 276 facial linear distances derived from 3D facial surface images of 2187 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We retained 23 facial factors, which we then tested for genetic associations using a genome-wide panel of 10,677,593 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, we identified genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10-8) associations in three regions, including two that are novel: one involving measures of midface height at 6q26 within an intron of PARK2 (lead SNP rs9456748; p = 4.99 × 10-8) and another involving measures of central upper lip height at 9p22 within FREM1 (lead SNP rs72713618; p = 2.02 × 10-8). In both cases, the genetic association was stronger with the composite facial factor phenotype than with any of the individual linear distances that comprise those factors. While the biological role of PARK2 in the craniofacial complex is currently unclear, there is evidence from both mouse models and Mendelian syndromes that FREM1 may influence facial variation. These results highlight the potential value of data-driven multivariate phenotyping for genetic studies of human facial morphology.	 26492185 10932189 22384356 22341974 23128226 15345741 21507892 23028347 20718045 15820308 14306381 19732862 27626380 24339768 9560156 14681479 25575512 20667081 25972376 21931569 27560520 21331089 24651127 14737177 21901785 16681992 27560698 17701901 23269371 17227368 27193062 19543373 22993228
28443625	Genome-wide meta-analysis of 241,258 adults accounting for smoking behaviour identifies novel loci for obesity traits.	Few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for environmental exposures, like smoking, potentially impacting the overall trait variance when investigating the genetic contribution to obesity-related traits. Here, we use GWAS data from 51,080 current smokers and 190,178 nonsmokers (87% European descent) to identify loci influencing BMI and central adiposity, measured as waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio both adjusted for BMI. We identify 23 novel genetic loci, and 9 loci with convincing evidence of gene-smoking interaction (GxSMK) on obesity-related traits. We show consistent direction of effect for all identified loci and significance for 18 novel and for 5 interaction loci in an independent study sample. These loci highlight novel biological functions, including response to oxidative stress, addictive behaviour, and regulatory functions emphasizing the importance of accounting for environment in genetic analyses. Our results suggest that tobacco smoking may alter the genetic susceptibility to overall adiposity and body fat distribution.	 25914268 19474294 17495208 20558818 12897061 20379614 19719041 23632083 23029258 11526494 19273465 16372019 25476971 22064851 17023178 24962921 21555518 21966540 24973796 25366762 22820512 18391177 26426971 23561647 25245072 17898222 11389829 25458846 25282103 26891735 25260699 10878674 10824345 15282395 20616382 23754948 21517776 21223575 21465548 25474695 17541511 25747123 17604717 25673412 10093001 24762786 22955989 15599400 20418889 23269371 25640676 15901795 24278677 20981092 26264275 21167468 19442458 10381158 24787896 21293137 1994740 25673413 22760307 18831000 16393783 12925520 18633328
28447399	Genome-wide association study of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND): A CHARTER group study.	HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) often complicates HIV infection despite combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and may be influenced by host genomics. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HAND in 1,050 CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) Study participants. All participants underwent standardized, comprehensive neurocognitive, and neuromedical assessments to determine if they had cognitive impairment as assessed by the Global Deficit Score (GDS), and individuals with comorbidities that could confound diagnosis of HAND were excluded. Neurocognitive outcomes included GDS-defined neurocognitive impairment (NCI; binary GDS, 366 cases with GDS ≥ 0.5 and 684 controls with GDS < 0.5, and GDS as a continuous variable) and Frascati HAND definitions that incorporate assessment of functional impairment by self-report and performance-based criteria. Genotype data were obtained using the Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 platform. Multivariable logistic or linear regression-based association tests were performed for GDS-defined NCI and HAND. GWAS results did not reveal SNPs meeting the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0 × 10	 24814848 17194218 26939565 27143670 21748284 21085122 9818943 24101401 24996618 26281765 25404233 23408335 26129753 18240061 25024348 26214276 22347417 24630139 21179499 23198981 26690344 17634261 26257835 25144566 24161715 25283135 18562290 19187430 22156200 18631256 21135382 17701901 25362201 26689235 24291026 21174240 22708483 24156898 22628157 25969563 17914061 27021072
28448500	Genome-wide physical activity interactions in adiposity - A meta-analysis of 200,452 adults.	Physical activity (PA) may modify the genetic effects that give rise to increased risk of obesity. To identify adiposity loci whose effects are modified by PA, we performed genome-wide interaction meta-analyses of BMI and BMI-adjusted waist circumference and waist-hip ratio from up to 200,452 adults of European (n = 180,423) or other ancestry (n = 20,029). We standardized PA by categorizing it into a dichotomous variable where, on average, 23% of participants were categorized as inactive and 77% as physically active. While we replicate the interaction with PA for the strongest known obesity-risk locus in the FTO gene, of which the effect is attenuated by ~30% in physically active individuals compared to inactive individuals, we do not identify additional loci that are sensitive to PA. In additional genome-wide meta-analyses adjusting for PA and interaction with PA, we identify 11 novel adiposity loci, suggesting that accounting for PA or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may facilitate gene discovery.	 26276885 22242005 22125224 26287746 11315092 25693563 19553294 26164771 22938557 22876189 21266646 26343387 3237850 25642630 22941224 21779176 24632002 21124985 22344221 21952300 22415877 24316577 22399527 10951545 27306667 8907704 1391136 24973796 20824172 26426971 17572673 19557197 22405075 10468429 22049296 12036577 11234459 25104851 20361391 23539218 17086182 25260699 21795687 20616382 20935630 20935629 9164270 21465548 11022047 16581306 17942823 19726594 21586553 4745816 16890538 21058334 25673412 23935507 21701570 24762786 22234326 19057666 2336074 10707084 22426310 23286752 23457539 24297897 17192493 12048245 23620691 21293137 21994764 25673413 12610534 9122206 22982992 16885160 22069379 10828068
28445677	Overexpression of the Cytokine BAFF and Autoimmunity Risk.	Genomewide association studies of autoimmune diseases have mapped hundreds of susceptibility regions in the genome. However, only for a few association signals has the causal gene been identified, and for even fewer have the causal variant and underlying mechanism been defined. Coincident associations of DNA variants affecting both the risk of autoimmune disease and quantitative immune variables provide an informative route to explore disease mechanisms and drug-targetable pathways.	 26432245 21833088 26366554 12427767 20453840 23522783 19687804 21296403 20595611 26366553 24554778 26502338 11603614 26199283 24852507 20678503 18272891 24074872 16494531 24037091 19491910 10398604 11115838 26754803 26006014 10587360 26037721 16934002 22936176 22047971 24076602 17763423 26366551 17962238 16285858 17664289 13880318 19788815

28453575	Genome-wide association study of red blood cell traits in Hispanics/Latinos: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Prior GWAS have identified loci associated with red blood cell (RBC) traits in populations of European, African, and Asian ancestry. These studies have not included individuals with an Amerindian ancestral background, such as Hispanics/Latinos, nor evaluated the full spectrum of genomic variation beyond single nucleotide variants. Using a custom genotyping array enriched for Amerindian ancestral content and 1000 Genomes imputation, we performed GWAS in 12,502 participants of Hispanic Community Health Study and Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) for hematocrit, hemoglobin, RBC count, RBC distribution width (RDW), and RBC indices. Approximately 60% of previously reported RBC trait loci generalized to HCHS/SOL Hispanics/Latinos, including African ancestral alpha- and beta-globin gene variants. In addition to the known 3.8kb alpha-globin copy number variant, we identified an Amerindian ancestral association in an alpha-globin regulatory region on chromosome 16p13.3 for mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. We also discovered and replicated three genome-wide significant variants in previously unreported loci for RDW (SLC12A2 rs17764730, PSMB5 rs941718), and hematocrit (PROX1 rs3754140). Among the proxy variants at the SLC12A2 locus we identified rs3812049, located in a bi-directional promoter between SLC12A2 (which encodes a red cell membrane ion-transport protein) and an upstream anti-sense long-noncoding RNA, LINC01184, as the likely causal variant. We further demonstrate that disruption of the regulatory element harboring rs3812049 affects transcription of SLC12A2 and LINC01184 in human erythroid progenitor cells. Together, these results reinforce the importance of genetic study of diverse ancestral populations, in particular Hispanics/Latinos.	 20609343 26748516 21075281 20128890 23274905 20044742 19234465 7649529 22398613 26468426 21526222 23128226 16466950 24637361 24907273 23446634 26366553 16522934 22064851 25270877 17077204 12045153 24312262 21577104 3997542 10723803 18757846 15790781 11010938 22955616 26805783 4054596 20609344 25961943 20927387 19820697 20061948 27863252 26075791 19862010 15070217 27668658 19066309 12874782 24675047 22733308 21058334 8943886 22955989 24487276 20139978 20495075 23222517 23263863 27346685 18220685 9054696 17061732 15855277 24487584 25503918 28090672 19820698 27172203 23041383 24227676 20081858 10953959 24013639 25954001 26748518

28471803	Search for genetic factor association with cancer-free prostate-specific antigen level elevation on the basis of a genome-wide association study in the Korean population.	We investigated the genetic markers associated with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (sPSA) levels to improve the predictive power of sPSA in screening for prostate cancer. A genome-wide association study was carried out among 4124 healthy Korean male adults using the Affymetrix Axiom Customized Biobank Genotyping Arrays for sPSA levels. A subgroup analysis for increased sPSA levels who underwent a prostate biopsy (n=64) was also carried out. We detected 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the Solute carrier family 45member 3, AGAP7P, MSMB, LOC101929917, and KLK3 genes associated with sPSA levels. The top SNP associated with the log of the sPSA levels was rs72434280 in the Solute carrier family 45 member 3 gene (P value, discovery set=2.98×10, replication set=7.31×10). A case-control study utilizing available biopsy reports (49 patients with normal biopsies vs. 15 patients with biopsies indicating cancer) for the sPSA more than 3 ng/ml group was carried out for the respective SNPs after adjusting for age. Only the SNPs near the KLK3 gene were associated with prostate cancer. In the model of the predictive elevation of sPSA level, adding the genetic risk score [area under the curve (AUC)=0.697] to age and BMI (AUC=0.602) significantly improved the results of the AUC (P<0.0001). We found seven SNPs associated with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels in healthy Korean men. Four SNPs were a novel marker in the Korean population. In men with increased prostate-specific antigen levels, genotyping SNP related to cancer-free elevation of sPSA level could be informative to decide the indication of prostate biopsy.	
28472463	Genome-wide association study meta-analysis for quantitative ultrasound parameters of bone identifies five novel loci for broadband ultrasound attenuation.	Osteoporosis is a common and debilitating bone disease that is characterised by low bone mineral density, typically assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS), commonly utilising the two parameters velocity of sound (VOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), is an alternative technology used to assess bone properties at peripheral skeletal sites. The genetic influence on the bone qualities assessed by QUS remains an under-studied area. We performed a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) including low-frequency variants (minor allele frequency ≥0.005) for BUA and VOS using a discovery population of individuals with whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from the UK10K project (n = 1268). These results were then meta-analysed with those from two deeply imputed GWAS replication cohorts (n = 1610 and 13 749). In the gender-combined analysis, we identified eight loci associated with BUA and five with VOS at the genome-wide significance level, including three novel loci for BUA at 8p23.1 (PPP1R3B), 11q23.1 (LOC387810) and 22q11.21 (SEPT5) (P = 2.4 × 10-8 to 1.6 × 10-9). Gene-based association testing in the gender-combined dataset revealed eight loci associated with BUA and seven with VOS after correction for multiple testing, with one novel locus for BUA at FAM167A (8p23.1) (P = 1.4 × 10-6). An additional novel locus for BUA was seen in the male-specific analysis at DEFB103B (8p23.1) (P = 1.8 × 10-6). Fracture analysis revealed significant associations between variation at the WNT16 and RSPO3 loci and fracture risk (P = 0.004 and 4.0 × 10-4, respectively). In conclusion, by performing a large GWAS meta-analysis for QUS parameters of bone using a combination of WGS and deeply imputed genotype data, we have identified five novel genetic loci associated with BUA.	 26432245 12378368 21810493 27933520 24273451 24430505 17198494 18396124 12726991 1991810 8592936 21903627 22253318 22138821 24013639 22064851 19275933 12081241 25209980 20864672 24316577 17572673 15523071 11872655 9893071 20686565 7976495 16157825 25260699 22037972 25518859 17254428 9718201 25961943 12639900 10893672 22504420 9080917 26139635 8757153 25786930 25743335 11242110 20509871 26367794 11833060 20634204 22426310 25306233 20981092 8992884 11444090 17873874 24487584 24840563 11181055 2816496 9868278 14745486 16696966 24932701 21605215 19543373 19240081 11943714 22706312 10501797 21423719 18455228 25954001
28476931	A Genome-Wide Association Study Using a Custom Genotyping Array Identifies Variants in 	Pima Indians living in Arizona have a high prevalence of obesity, and we have previously shown that a relatively lower energy expenditure (EE) predicts weight and fat mass gain in this population. EE is a familial trait (heritability = 0.52); therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify genetic variants that affect EE and thereby influence BMI and body fatness in Pima Indians. Genotypic data from 491,265 variants were analyzed for association with resting metabolic rate (RMR) and 24-h EE assessed in a whole-room calorimeter in 507 and 419 Pima Indians, respectively. Variants associated with both measures of EE were analyzed for association with maximum BMI and percent body fat (PFAT) in 5,870 and 912 Pima Indians, respectively. rs11014566 nominally associated with both measures of EE and both measures of adiposity in Pima Indians, where the G allele (frequency: Pima Indians = 0.60, Europeans <0.01) associated with lower 24-h EE (β = -33 kcal/day per copy), lower RMR (β = -31 kcal/day), higher BMI (β = +0.6 kg/m	 3421330 23974925 24390345 21165629 25103139 17823426 17030972 6540980 22915022 2031485 23418317 1328091 19008344 27966570 21310274 2336075 22689652 16183910 3782471 25792749 18421262 2657322 26086330 7068313 3724804 22810975 12502614 7834744 8782724 12975636 2018460 9545414 26888156 3340128 16685049 7572700 4050294 7883999 22371490 9042926 25673413 27111224 15870896 27581474 20668236
28485404	Genetic contributors to variation in alcohol consumption vary by race/ethnicity in a large multi-ethnic genome-wide association study.	Alcohol consumption is a complex trait determined by both genetic and environmental factors, and is correlated with the risk of alcohol use disorders. Although a small number of genetic loci have been reported to be associated with variation in alcohol consumption, genetic factors are estimated to explain about half of the variance in alcohol consumption, suggesting that additional loci remain to be discovered. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of alcohol consumption in the large Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort, in four race/ethnicity groups: non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic/Latinos, East Asians and African Americans. We examined two statistically independent phenotypes reflecting subjects' alcohol consumption during the past year, based on self-reported information: any alcohol intake (drinker/non-drinker status) and the regular quantity of drinks consumed per week (drinks/week) among drinkers. We assessed these two alcohol consumption phenotypes in each race/ethnicity group, and in a combined trans-ethnic meta-analysis comprising a total of 86 627 individuals. We observed the strongest association between the previously reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs671 in ALDH2 and alcohol drinker status (odd ratio (OR)=0.40, P=2.28 × 10	 20374207 26365420 26034056 17047687 21372407 2562960 16862161 22384356 17847010 19581740 20380771 23300957 22138821 21968928 24277619 17222275 19262484 12050823 26092718 20109832 17718394 22820512 26092716 24621545 2014795 24963129 20236774 25365528 23529720 20517342 10441588 16642443 20074233 27392424 21497796 17471563 19261227 11141041 15897737 23364009 23456092 7625477 18498207 26036284 24967831 21689117 20634204 17701901 21471458 23409916 18996923 27911795 27087413 21565264 23712313 11022800 21270382 19621845 19543373 20482788 21903159 26231237 23953852 18702821 11775078

28502801	Genome-Wide Association Shows that Pigmentation Genes Play a Role in Skin Aging.	Loss of fine skin patterning is a sign of both aging and photoaging. Studies investigating the genetic contribution to skin patterning offer an opportunity to better understand a trait that influences both physical appearance and risk of keratinocyte skin cancer. We undertook a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of a measure of skin pattern (microtopography score) damage in 1,671 twin pairs and 1,745 singletons (N = 5,087) drawn from three independent cohorts. We identified that rs185146 near SLC45A2 is associated with a skin aging trait at genome-wide significance (P = 4.1 × 10	
28492228	Association between a common immunoglobulin heavy chain allele and rheumatic heart disease risk in Oceania.	The indigenous populations of the South Pacific experience a high burden of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of RHD susceptibility in 2,852 individuals recruited in eight Oceanian countries. Stratifying by ancestry, we analysed genotyped and imputed variants in Melanesians (607 cases and 1,229 controls) before follow-up of suggestive loci in three further ancestral groups: Polynesians, South Asians and Mixed or other populations (totalling 399 cases and 617 controls). We identify a novel susceptibility signal in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus centring on a haplotype of nonsynonymous variants in the IGHV4-61 gene segment corresponding to the IGHV4-61*02 allele. We show each copy of IGHV4-61*02 is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in the risk of RHD (odds ratio 1.43, 95% confidence intervals 1.27-1.61, P=4.1 × 10	 15546341 1967206 9140404 21326860 8490662 11315092 21833088 23546444 24473328 22384356 25892111 21085122 25641019 16253886 7734345 25536486 22708584 9138148 21035459 22138821 22125221 26371755 24006373 23541343 25431634 21677798 20644199 2988335 21565292 19797947 9712075 11397087 25722852 14170842 20354512 20517342 25891492 22371105 19758136 23708320 21249354 24509480 23657481 24162737 20980556 22551722 17554300 25653097 26963563 3006484 7672089 21709689 24215025 23104008 19752868 24700103 21167468 24739678 652041 18292342 10813149 21980428 23797669 19543373 18040280 3713863 18848134 9550331

28498854	Single-trait and multi-trait genome-wide association analyses identify novel loci for blood pressure in African-ancestry populations.	Hypertension is a leading cause of global disease, mortality, and disability. While individuals of African descent suffer a disproportionate burden of hypertension and its complications, they have been underrepresented in genetic studies. To identify novel susceptibility loci for blood pressure and hypertension in people of African ancestry, we performed both single and multiple-trait genome-wide association analyses. We analyzed 21 genome-wide association studies comprised of 31,968 individuals of African ancestry, and validated our results with additional 54,395 individuals from multi-ethnic studies. These analyses identified nine loci with eleven independent variants which reached genome-wide significance (P < 1.25×10-8) for either systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, or for combined traits. Single-trait analyses identified two loci (TARID/TCF21 and LLPH/TMBIM4) and multiple-trait analyses identified one novel locus (FRMD3) for blood pressure. At these three loci, as well as at GRP20/CDH17, associated variants had alleles common only in African-ancestry populations. Functional annotation showed enrichment for genes expressed in immune and kidney cells, as well as in heart and vascular cells/tissues. Experiments driven by these findings and using angiotensin-II induced hypertension in mice showed altered kidney mRNA expression of six genes, suggesting their potential role in hypertension. Our study provides new evidence for genes related to hypertension susceptibility, and the need to study African-ancestry populations in order to identify biologic factors contributing to hypertension.	 24789589 10818078 18391085 23229778 18375949 25764978 16862161 17668372 26507551 23128226 12214310 25642630 23245609 25776069 11040222 19609347 25469260 25500260 25883115 23688675 23972371 22820512 21572416 19430479 18852204 15665825 16077740 24508826 25007871 20616382 18043751 20647424 1348081 24702953 19553469 23117777 27618447 21422096 26414676 12675855 11642401 10572052 16494531 22276822 20038749 19176688 12493255 18722519 17875676 26414678 15851645 24396023 25233454 24762786 17989143 26719775 17954720 16216999 28062568 18205252 12724055 24585465 27618448 23940116 27618452 22426310 21167468 26390057 20714348 19396169 21909115 12748199 12952881 28135244 14614392 22215894 17682258 24133117 19543373 24134304 23253259 12559688
28552477	Genome-wide association study of erythrocyte density in sickle cell disease patients.	Deoxy-hemoglobin S polymerization into rigid fibers is the direct cause of the clinical sequelae observed in sickle cell disease (SCD). The rate of polymerization of sickle hemoglobin is determined primarily by intracellular hemoglobin concentration, itself dependent on the amount of sickle hemoglobin and on red blood cell (RBC) volume. Dense, dehydrated RBC (DRBC) are observed in SCD patients, and their number correlates with hemolytic parameters and complications such as renal dysfunction, leg ulcers and priapism. To identify new genes involved in RBC hydration in SCD, we performed the first genome-wide association study for DRBC in 374 sickle cell anemia (HbSS) patients. We did not find genome-wide significant results, indicating that variants that modulate DRBC have modest-to-weak effects. A secondary analysis demonstrated a nominal association (P=0.003) between DRBC in SCD patients and a variant associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in non-anemic individuals. This intronic variant controls the expression of ATP2B4, the main calcium pump in erythrocytes. Our study highlights ATP2B4 as a promising target for modulation of RBC hydration in SCD patients.

28334935	Genome-wide association study of iron traits and relation to diabetes in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL): potential genomic intersection of iron and glucose regulation?	Genetic variants contribute to normal variation of iron-related traits and may also cause clinical syndromes of iron deficiency or excess. Iron overload and deficiency can adversely affect human health. For example, elevated iron storage is associated with increased diabetes risk, although mechanisms are still being investigated. We conducted the first genome-wide association study of serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation, and ferritin in a Hispanic/Latino cohort, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (>12 000 participants) and also assessed the generalization of previously known loci to this population. We then evaluated whether iron-associated variants were associated with diabetes and glycemic traits. We found evidence for a novel association between TIBC and a variant near the gene for protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B; rs4841132, β = -0.116, P = 7.44 × 10-8). The effect strengthened when iron deficient individuals were excluded (β = -0.121, P = 4.78 × 10-9). Ten of sixteen variants previously associated with iron traits generalized to HCHS/SOL, including variants at the transferrin (TF), hemochromatosis (HFE), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2)/myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), transmembrane protease, serine 6 (TMPRSS6), transferrin receptor (TFR2), N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) (NAT2), ABO blood group (ABO), and GRB2 associated binding protein 3 (GAB3) loci. In examining iron variant associations with glucose homeostasis, an iron-raising variant of TMPRSS6 was associated with lower HbA1c levels (P = 8.66 × 10-10). This association was attenuated upon adjustment for iron measures. In contrast, the iron-raising allele of PPP1R3B was associated with higher levels of fasting glucose (P = 7.70 × 10-7) and fasting insulin (P = 4.79 × 10-6), but these associations were not attenuated upon adjustment for TIBC-so iron is not likely a mediator. These results provide new genetic information on iron traits and their connection with glucose homeostasis.	 20609343 20858683 25224454 10453183 25843914 26379229 25352340 10739755 22064851 23117778 24137020 11872655 15790781 22301935 20042775 10535879 26494808 25768928 20609344 21300955 12507977 19862010 22761678 26662797 24509480 23903356 26433129 22001757 22581228 9439462 18061062 24904118 16325165 20634204 23473030 25162662 26519772 20008199 23269371 12358889 24097068 3281000 21873547 25061138 28090672 10587829 17698317 20081857 19543373 21423719 20081858 22815867 26748518

28545128	Common variants upstream of MLF1 at 3q25 and within CPZ at 4p16 associated with neuroblastoma.	Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the developing sympathetic nervous system that most commonly presents in young children and accounts for approximately 12% of pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort or 2,101 cases and 4,202 controls of European ancestry. We identify two new association signals at 3q25 and 4p16 that replicated robustly in multiple independent cohorts comprising 1,163 cases and 4,396 controls (3q25: rs6441201 combined P = 1.2x10-11, Odds Ratio 1.23, 95% CI:1.16-1.31; 4p16: rs3796727 combined P = 1.26x10-12, Odds Ratio 1.30, 95% CI: 1.21-1.40). The 4p16 signal maps within the carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) gene. The 3q25 signal resides within the arginine/serine-rich coiled-coil 1 (RSRC1) gene and upstream of the myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) gene. Increased expression of MLF1 was observed in neuroblastoma cells homozygous for the rs6441201 risk allele (P = 0.02), and significant growth inhibition was observed upon depletion of MLF1 (P < 0.0001) in neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, we show that common DNA variants within CPZ at 4p16 and upstream of MLF1 at 3q25 influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and MLF1 likely plays an important role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.	 22367537 21504710 20558371 25693563 18463370 18316654 15122318 19412175 27677580 12944424 15024693 17203224 22138821 18847325 17967869 22416102 15338462 26100672 21436895 24634504 17572673 21124317 22955616 19536264 11021751 24194598 20616382 26560027 19065146 20444257 23042116 23334666 18923523 15798186 26481147 11766880 21036922 22328350 12824369 8570204 23202128 19543373 22350409 18724359 22941191 15246564
28525603	Genome-Wide Association Study of Psychosis Proneness in the Finnish Population.	The current study examined quantitative measures of psychosis proneness in a nonpsychotic population, in order to elucidate their underlying genetic architecture and to observe if there is any commonality to that already detected in the studies of individuals with overt psychotic conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Heritability, univariate and multivariate genome-wide association (GWAs) tests, including a series of comprehensive gene-based association analyses, were developed in 4269 nonpsychotic persons participating in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 study with information on the following psychometric measures: Hypomanic Personality, Perceptual Aberration, Physical and Social Anhedonia (also known as Chapman's Schizotypia scales), and Schizoidia scale. Genome-wide genetic data was available for ~9.84 million SNPs. Heritability estimates ranged from 16% to 27%. Phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlations ranged from 0.04-0.43, 0.25-0.73, and 0.12-0.43, respectively. Univariate GWAs tests revealed an intronic SNP (rs12449097) at the TMC7 gene (16p12.3) that significantly associated (P = 3.485 × 10-8) with the hypomanic scale. Bivariate GWAs tests including the hypomanic and physical anhedonia scales suggested a further borderline significant SNP (rs188320715; P-value = 5.261 × 10-8, ~572 kb downstream the ARID1B gene at 6q25.3). Gene-based tests highlighted 20 additional genes of which 5 had previously been associated to schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder: CSMD1, CCDC141, SLC1A2, CACNA1C, and SNAP25. Altogether the findings explained from 3.7% to 14.1% of the corresponding trait heritability. In conclusion, this study provides preliminary genomic evidence suggesting that qualitatively similar biological factors may underlie different psychosis proneness measures, some of which could further predispose to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.	 23442767 14990519 17323132 16738342 18668038 16967335 23974872 21525167 351663 18606047 25962355 500949 18483150 17551090 25056061 681612 12499305 22363459 11479587 20956536 25075799 19019849 17572673 8296903 26049723 25722988 21369821 8377097 15296513 25518859 19066302 27157801 21846867 23453885 19188535 12192614 10762547 20598278 6808536 18507876 21142928 18647788 20705805 15863738 12209867 16545544 956504 17716072 17701901 8040487 3745642 12877395 18081023 11665322 21167468 20923924 21451346 17604122 8666700 22437316 12651872 23332683 24174267 24718684 9516665
28540026	Meta-analysis of GWAS of over 16,000 individuals with autism spectrum disorder highlights a novel locus at 10q24.32 and a significant overlap with schizophrenia.	Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) <1.15).	 22350336 19404257 24768552 21993624 21572417 26849113 21926974 23933821 23620727 25534755 21926972 11452364 20691407 23959427 24381304 26709141 25056061 25642630 22411800 17322880 23879678 26402605 22521361 25180572 19812673 24267887 25363768 19456320 22253303 2745388 20804367 25363760 24794370 25518859 12032595 20616382 1821847 25266127 20118450 25722852 7814313 22843504 12192642 19218885 20955925 26414676 26130694 18852200 26913486 24387789 24133439 20598278 20149593 21078308 25038753 20950788 22820511 22739633 19404256 23657481 19454485 22511450 21647175 20663923 21680558 20848658 17701901 16835068 25887572 14966474 18348202 26289574 22513993 16467216 21757185 24214399 23275889 18184952 15378037 23153825 23715297 21844053 20531469 24473445 20573900

28533516	ASD restricted and repetitive behaviors associated at 17q21.33: genes prioritized by expression in fetal brains.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined condition that manifests in infancy or early childhood as deficits in communication skills and social interactions. Often, restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) accompany this disorder. ASD is polygenic and genetically complex, so we hypothesized that focusing analyses on intermediate core component phenotypes, such as RRBs, can reduce genetic heterogeneity and improve statistical power. Applying this approach, we mined Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from two of the largest ASD family cohorts, the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange and Autism Genome Project (AGP). Of the 12 RRBs measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, seven were found to be significantly familial and substantially variable, and hence, were tested for genome-wide association in 3104 ASD-affected children from 2045 families.

28540843	Genome-Wide Significance for PCLO as a Gene for Major Depressive Disorder.	In 2009, the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for major depressive disorder (MDD) highlighted an association with PCLO locus on chromosome 7, although not reaching genome-wide significance level. In the present study, we revisited the original GWAS after increasing the overall sample size and the number of interrogated SNPs. In an analysis comparing 1,942 cases with lifetime diagnosis of MDD and 4,565 controls, PCLO showed a genome-wide significant association with MDD at SNP (rs2715157, p = 2.91 × 10-8) and gene-based (p = 1.48 × 10-7) level. Our results confirm the potential role of the PCLO gene in MDD, which is worth further replication and functional studies.

We identified 13 novel T2D-associated loci (	 22286214 26367797 23128226 25597830 17452018 25954002 17167473 26323059 24699409 22820512 24413736 27189021 22955616 20581827 24990862 26551672 20935630 21157483 27398621 21873549 25631608 24509480 22581228 17098089 21980299 24411943 24464100 24439387 24296717 23562494 24141362 23104008 25673412 24915262 24127591 18372903 22426310 21717116 24097068 21167468 24114802 26063472 22885922 20081857 25363779 19543373 20081858 15823385 25954001 25157153
28577822	Genome-wide association study of language performance in Alzheimer's disease.	Language impairment is common in prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progresses over time. However, the genetic architecture underlying language performance is poorly understood. To identify novel genetic variants associated with language performance, we analyzed brain MRI and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a composite measure of language performance from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n=1560). The language composite score was associated with brain atrophy on MRI in language and semantic areas. GWAS identified GLI3 (GLI family zinc finger 3) as significantly associated with language performance (p<5×10	 20451872 10693759 21159998 18339515 25690665 11520668 24493627 23042737 1449404 24741381 21750375 25120480 19954747 26194313 16849325 14734594 22019776 2118997 22298328 23554593 21116054 20501604 21875407 17011743 24142144 17485107 24556551 19877269 21514250 16571630 22782295 10441342 22865056 22884464 25130324 22728617 11571033 25812849 12672860 9054938 20634204 2328410 17701901 10912591 14732621 22235033 11099452 18348202 10439584 1832072 25065397 22480918 23396189 15178173 25448601 23738518 14681189 2076493

28604728	Identification of 19 new risk loci and potential regulatory mechanisms influencing susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumor.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed understanding of susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), but much of the heritability remains unexplained. Here we report a new GWAS, a meta-analysis with previous GWAS and a replication series, totaling 7,319 TGCT cases and 23,082 controls. We identify 19 new TGCT risk loci, roughly doubling the number of known TGCT risk loci to 44. By performing in situ Hi-C in TGCT cells, we provide evidence for a network of physical interactions among all 44 TGCT risk SNPs and candidate causal genes. Our findings implicate widespread disruption of developmental transcriptional regulators as a basis of TGCT susceptibility, consistent with failed primordial germ cell differentiation as an initiating step in oncogenesis. Defective microtubule assembly and dysregulation of KIT-MAPK signaling also feature as recurrently disrupted pathways. Our findings support a polygenic model of risk and provide insight into the biological basis of TGCT.	 17895893 24369860 16110032 25598472 25497547 12111919 12213678 21779441 25281660 18715499 19509152 19001867 23666239 19372138 22138821 22064851 26588606 10604464 23315928 9230307 19410550 20837710 26835000 22820512 25887522 25609015 17572673 19483681 22955616 22930834 22405274 15608251 26349679 23001124 26503584 16415888 25466283 18622394 20543847 25908662 26070982 15208620 20517342 21551455 23535731 23715323 21357174 19483682 25913387 24335146 22730293 16549803 23666240 20418889 27306882 24120139 25208325 16228001 21623831 25877299 12140361 9413462 16873377 22373907 25266793 21464220 11984562 20819937 25938943
28604730	Large-scale association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci and heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across histological subtypes.	Although several lung cancer susceptibility loci have been identified, much of the heritability for lung cancer remains unexplained. Here 14,803 cases and 12,262 controls of European descent were genotyped on the OncoArray and combined with existing data for an aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of lung cancer in 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls. We identified 18 susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, including 10 new loci. The new loci highlight the striking heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across the histological subtypes of lung cancer, with four loci associated with lung cancer overall and six loci associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in 1,425 normal lung tissue samples highlights RNASET2, SECISBP2L and NRG1 as candidate genes. Other loci include genes such as a cholinergic nicotinic receptor, CHRNA2, and the telomere-related genes OFBC1 and RTEL1. Further exploration of the target genes will continue to provide new insights into the etiology of lung cancer.	 20418890 27197191 17668372 24851284 23370545 20570966 25642630 23128233 22899653 26961892 26635082 26363803 17572673 16077740 23209423 21566536 24908248 23143601 15630470 25804397 21102463 27713484 26646793 26414676 23535721 18587394 24880342 15990124 20548021 26746459 23535734 11728548 21167468 20395204 23850713 24572595 27697780 19836008 24469108 25954001 26138067

28608620	Genome-wide association study of facial emotion recognition in children and association with polygenic risk for mental health disorders.	Emotion recognition is disrupted in many mental health disorders, which may reflect shared genetic aetiology between this trait and these disorders. We explored genetic influences on emotion recognition and the relationship between these influences and mental health phenotypes. Eight-year-old participants (n = 4,097) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) completed the Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA) faces test. Genome-wide genotype data was available from the Illumina HumanHap550 Quad microarray. Genome-wide association studies were performed to assess associations with recognition of individual emotions and emotion in general. Exploratory polygenic risk scoring was performed using published genomic data for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, autism spectrum disorder, anorexia, and anxiety disorders. No individual genetic variants were identified at conventional levels of significance in any analysis although several loci were associated at a level suggestive of significance. SNP-chip heritability analyses did not identify a heritable component of variance for any phenotype. Polygenic scores were not associated with any phenotype. The effect sizes of variants influencing emotion recognition are likely to be small. Previous studies of emotion identification have yielded non-zero estimates of SNP-heritability. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in the measurement and analysis of the phenotype.	 17683341 22507743 15653288 20809200 15755224 17346241 21926972 14514489 12727138 25056061 25642630 12499305 23475001 25550326 23555274 25515860 26754954 17517149 27754483 22820512 24564958 10030445 10789354 12597072 26299295 25387716 25722852 25620996 19329561 16319410 17984393 23774735 20233392 26189816 22472876 24721987 22251308 21152015 21058334 20971165 10448187 19142765 9192895 17118928 16045522 24367110 23284144 21601927 25023143 10946756 14997420 21167468 20636189 24074471 19571811 8283869 17726476 521902 16854439
28613276	Genetic loci associated with heart rate variability and their effects on cardiac disease risk.	Reduced cardiac vagal control reflected in low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with greater risks for cardiac morbidity and mortality. In two-stage meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for three HRV traits in up to 53,174 individuals of European ancestry, we detect 17 genome-wide significant SNPs in eight loci. HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs (in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11, RGS6 and HCN4).

28628665	A chromosome 5q31.1 locus associates with tuberculin skin test reactivity in HIV-positive individuals from tuberculosis hyper-endemic regions in east Africa.	One in three people has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and the risk for MTB infection in HIV-infected individuals is even higher. We hypothesized that HIV-positive individuals living in tuberculosis-endemic regions who do not get infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis are genetically resistant. Using an "experiment of nature" design that proved successful in our previous work, we performed a genome-wide association study of tuberculin skin test positivity using 469 HIV-positive patients from prospective study cohorts of tuberculosis from Tanzania and Uganda to identify genetic loci associated with MTB infection in the context of HIV-infection. Among these individuals, 244 tested were tuberculin skin test (TST) positive either at enrollment or during the >8 year follow up, while 225 were not. We identified a genome-wide significant association between a dominant model of rs877356 and binary TST status in the combined cohort (Odds ratio = 0.2671, p = 1.22x10-8). Association was replicated with similar significance when examining TST induration as a continuous trait. The variant lies in the 5q31.1 region, 57kb downstream from IL9. Two-locus analyses of association of variants near rs877356 showed a haplotype comprised of rs877356 and an IL9 missense variant, rs2069885, had the most significant association (p = 1.59x10-12). We also replicated previously linked loci on chromosomes 2, 5, and 11. IL9 is a cytokine produced by mast cells and TH2 cells during inflammatory responses, providing a possible link between airway inflammation and protection from MTB infection. Our results indicate that studying uninfected, HIV-positive participants with extensive exposure increases the power to detect associations in complex infectious disease.	 20959295 3137580 22384356 1693525 23641253 23128226 8118628 7686859 25143445 2404438 7666875 8509135 3812414 15035039 10881762 2915455 18382088 8032047 2118397 20118767 12588714 22955616 10817790 8583267 17703412 11782049 23060615 25525872 21812969 15297300 24970328 26942285 19116662 19901083 20169197 2574778 10589003 19258923 17101709 23516984 24754895 16979761 1891008 19537417 20634204 17701901 21368237 21339819 22492155 10562299 21799772 17131776 23266187 25521228 7807661 19543373
28627999	Heritability and genome-wide associations studies of cerebral blood flow in the general population.	Cerebral blood flow is an important process for brain functioning and its dysregulation is implicated in multiple neurological disorders. While environmental risk factors have been identified, it remains unclear to what extent the flow is regulated by genetics. Here we performed heritability and genome-wide association analyses of cerebral blood flow in a population-based cohort study. We included 4472 persons free of cortical infarcts who underwent genotyping and phase-contrast magnetic resonance flow imaging (mean age 64.8 ± 10.8 years). The flow rate, cross-sectional area of the vessel, and flow velocity through the vessel were measured in the basilar artery and bilateral carotids. We found that the flow rate of the basilar artery is most heritable (h2 (SE) = 24.1 (9.8), p-value = 0.0056), and this increased over age. The association studies revealed two significant loci for the right carotid artery area (rs12546630, p-value = 2.0 × 10	 23127979 17351290 27428752 27694991 20562875 15668720 18215617 28098162 25420145 20222955 19732386 19344687 19488046 25607358 27322543 22820512 24258680 21654697 16574919 16306271 20616382 27496552 19319544 22002080 17622253 23508266 26219847 27976715 22252235 16388306 23818655 21068832 12960526 23793025 21167468 12112496 23358157 10468506 17765329 14975100 9171059 27782180 17572111

Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, HTT. Age at onset has been used as a quantitative phenotype in genetic analysis looking for Huntington's disease modifiers, but is hard to define and not always available. Therefore, we aimed to generate a novel measure of disease progression and to identify genetic markers associated with this progression measure.	
28632202	Genome-wide association study of borderline personality disorder reveals genetic overlap with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.	Borderline personality disorder (BOR) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, and characterized by affective instability and impulsivity, diagnostic symptoms also observed in manic phases of bipolar disorder (BIP). Up to 20% of BIP patients show comorbidity with BOR. This report describes the first case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BOR, performed in one of the largest BOR patient samples worldwide. The focus of our analysis was (i) to detect genes and gene sets involved in BOR and (ii) to investigate the genetic overlap with BIP. As there is considerable genetic overlap between BIP, major depression (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) and a high comorbidity of BOR and MDD, we also analyzed the genetic overlap of BOR with SCZ and MDD. GWAS, gene-based tests and gene-set analyses were performed in 998 BOR patients and 1545 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to detect the genetic overlap between BOR and these disorders. Single marker analysis revealed no significant association after correction for multiple testing.

28654678	Genetic factors affecting EBV copy number in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the 1000 Genome Project samples.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 4, has been classically associated with infectious mononucleosis, multiple sclerosis and several types of cancers. Many of these diseases show marked geographical differences in prevalence, which points to underlying genetic and/or environmental factors. Those factors may include a different susceptibility to EBV infection and viral copy number among human populations. Since EBV is commonly used to transform B-cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) we hypothesize that differences in EBV copy number among individual LCLs may reflect differential susceptibility to EBV infection. To test this hypothesis, we retrieved whole-genome sequenced EBV-mapping reads from 1,753 LCL samples derived from 19 populations worldwide that were sequenced within the context of the 1000 Genomes Project. An in silico methodology was developed to estimate the number of EBV copy number in LCLs and validated these estimations by real-time PCR. After experimentally confirming that EBV relative copy number remains stable over cell passages, we performed a genome wide association analysis (GWAS) to try detecting genetic variants of the host that may be associated with EBV copy number. Our GWAS has yielded several genomic regions suggestively associated with the number of EBV genomes per cell in LCLs, unraveling promising candidate genes such as CAND1, a known inhibitor of EBV replication. While this GWAS does not unequivocally establish the degree to which genetic makeup of individuals determine viral levels within their derived LCLs, for which a larger sample size will be needed, it potentially highlighted human genes affecting EBV-related processes, which constitute interesting candidates to follow up in the context of EBV related pathologies.	 24586164 17945327 24682154 12781368 16547280 14663138 17384015 8769480 25430668 23019411 16404738 19192299 26782058 10921899 18282298 15688063 17492755 21486137 22589722 25609584 26861404 20708603 12874607 19505943 23386127 25290448 25518859 25003566 21051598 20843302 18838382 12592401 25192014 24130483 20598278 2231712 21478889 18432252 19755393 19010793 24721987 22474075 14662920 25732820 22730293 12145742 20634204 21478335 17707260 12527209 22964660 23326239 17641165 21167468 22761553 19596032 24626628 22706312 15202522 17143291 20190741 17675336 26857264

28662289	Genome-wide association analysis identifies a GLUL haplotype for familial hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.	A family history of liver cancer increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 2-fold to 10-fold among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Previous genome-wide association studies have identified many possible susceptible loci associated with sporadic HBV-related HCC. However, despite family history being a well-known risk factor for HBV-related HCC, to the authors' knowledge its genetic mechanisms and associating loci remain largely unknown or unexplored, most likely due to the relative rarity of familial HCC and the difficulty of sample collection.	
28641744	Polygenic risk score and heritability estimates reveals a genetic relationship between ASD and OCD.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are both highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders that conceivably share genetic risk factors. However, the underlying genetic determinants remain largely unknown. In this work, the authors describe a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ASD and OCD. The OCD dataset includes 2998 individuals in nuclear families. The ASD dataset includes 6898 individuals in case-parents trios. GWAS summary statistics were examined for potential enrichment of functional variants associated with gene expression levels in brain regions.

29731509	A genome-wide association study for extremely high intelligence.	We used a case-control genome-wide association (GWA) design with cases consisting of 1238 individuals from the top 0.0003 (~170 mean IQ) of the population distribution of intelligence and 8172 unselected population-based controls. The single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability for the extreme IQ trait was 0.33 (0.02), which is the highest so far for a cognitive phenotype, and significant genome-wide genetic correlations of 0.78 were observed with educational attainment and 0.86 with population IQ. Three variants in locus ADAM12 achieved genome-wide significance, although they did not replicate with published GWA analyses of normal-range IQ or educational attainment. A genome-wide polygenic score constructed from the GWA results accounted for 1.6% of the variance of intelligence in the normal range in an unselected sample of 3414 individuals, which is comparable to the variance explained by GWA studies of intelligence with substantially larger sample sizes. The gene family plexins, members of which are mutated in several monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, was significantly enriched for associations with high IQ. This study shows the utility of extreme trait selection for genetic study of intelligence and suggests that extremely high intelligence is continuous genetically with normal-range intelligence in the population.	 27548312 27070863 25644384 11519655 16862161 28095416 25642630 26711998 23555274 25885710 23358156 25599223 24413527 21943169 25132410 19859063 25593376 26430803 27431296 22041814 27225220 25282103 27604932 20306291 25201988 20517342 26414676 23110994 23531483 25082288 23919982 27225129 24342839 15800012 9875845 25003214 21167468 22243964 24307393 26303664 26239293 27046643

28698626	A genome-wide association study suggests the HLA Class II region as the major susceptibility locus for IgA vasculitis.	The genetic component of Immunoglobulin-A (IgA) vasculitis is still far to be elucidated. To increase the current knowledge on the genetic component of this vasculitis we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on this condition. 308 IgA vasculitis patients and 1,018 healthy controls from Spain were genotyped by Illumina HumanCore BeadChips. Imputation of GWAS data was performed using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase III dataset as reference panel. After quality control filters and GWAS imputation, 285 patients and 1,006 controls remained in the datasets and were included in further analysis. Additionally, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region was comprehensively studied by imputing classical alleles and polymorphic amino acid positions. A linkage disequilibrium block of polymorphisms located in the HLA class II region surpassed the genome-wide level of significance (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46-0.68). Although no polymorphic amino acid positions were associated at the genome-wide level of significance, P-values of potential relevance were observed for the positions 13 and 11 of HLA-DRB1 (P = 6.67E-05, P = 1.88E-05, respectively). Outside the HLA, potential associations were detected, but none of them were close to the statistical significance. In conclusion, our study suggests that IgA vasculitis is an archetypal HLA class II disease.	 25470797 22286218 11723761 27548383 24646467 23045170 23762245 25405820 18398418 23782179 1613701 24387989 25817017 25889603 2202310 17701901 22808956 19543373

28706201	Genotypic variability based association identifies novel non-additive loci DHCR7 and IRF4 in sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis.	Sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly heterogeneous disorder with only a few additive loci identified to date. We report a genotypic variability-based genome-wide association study (vGWAS) of six cohorts of sero-negative RA recruited in Europe and the US that were genotyped with the Immunochip. A two-stage approach was used: (1) a mixed model to partition dichotomous phenotypes into an additive component and non-additive residuals on the liability scale and (2) the Levene's test to assess equality of the residual variances across genotype groups. The vGWAS identified rs2852853 (P = 1.3e-08, DHCR7) and rs62389423 (P = 1.8e-05, near IRF4) in addition to two previously identified loci (HLA-DQB1 and ANKRD55), which were all statistically validated using cross validation. DHCR7 encodes an enzyme important in cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D and DHCR7 mutations are believed to be important for early humans to adapt to Northern Europe where residents have reduced ultraviolet-B exposure and tend to have light skin color. IRF4 is a key locus responsible for skin color, with a vitamin D receptor-binding interval. These vGWAS results together suggest that vitamin D deficiency is potentially causal of sero-negative RA and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder.	 24532677 20541253 23143596 15803198 23910463 22272569 23150607 27109064 20428936 24771767 26258845 24298061 26879349 25101110 20942902 22661644 20736230 26895230 22827487 25152454 21345260 20418485 26599497 25506102 25200660 24267888 26755675 23897126 23636220 20212493 25724930 26528330 25262152 21167468 23837623 24728037 20541252 20601685 20585554 22982992

28757204	Low-Frequency Synonymous Coding Variation in CYP2R1 Has Large Effects on Vitamin D Levels and Risk of Multiple Sclerosis.	Vitamin D insufficiency is common, correctable, and influenced by genetic factors, and it has been associated with risk of several diseases. We sought to identify low-frequency genetic variants that strongly increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and tested their effect on risk of multiple sclerosis, a disease influenced by low vitamin D concentrations. We used whole-genome sequencing data from 2,619 individuals through the UK10K program and deep-imputation data from 39,655 individuals genotyped genome-wide. Meta-analysis of the summary statistics from 19 cohorts identified in CYP2R1 the low-frequency (minor allele frequency = 2.5%) synonymous coding variant g.14900931G>A (p.Asp120Asp) (rs117913124[A]), which conferred a large effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels (-0.43 SD of standardized natural log-transformed 25OHD per A allele; p value = 1.5 × 10	 27548312 26432245 17194218 8201479 26366554 21310306 16862161 21085122 26367797 8530107 20686493 21903627 24413527 19525955 17572673 26305103 21653522 21478889 27694958 24076602 10735584 15128933 20509871 25826379 26367794 22596255 24676807 26368830 17660530 21167468 15297675 20541252 18030310

Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and dyslipidemia are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibrates are a class of drugs prescribed to treat dyslipidemia, but variation in response has been observed. To evaluate common and rare genetic variants that impact lipid responses to fenofibrate in statin-treated patients with T2D, we examined lipid changes in response to fenofibrate therapy using a genomewide association study (GWAS).

28738859	Genes and pathways underlying susceptibility to impaired lung function in the context of environmental tobacco smoke exposure.	Studies aiming to assess genetic susceptibility for impaired lung function levels upon exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) have thus far focused on candidate-genes selected based on a-priori knowledge of potentially relevant biological pathways, such as glutathione S-transferases and ADAM33. By using a hypothesis-free approach, we aimed to identify novel susceptibility loci, and additionally explored biological pathways potentially underlying this susceptibility to impaired lung function in the context of ETS exposure.	 22792237 18075776 8564092 17217536 20008879 16571143 12231496 7952544 24645673 20616382 21487444 23937118 11784622 12153756 25502107 21652557 20435672 8499054 24747433 17022810 20639653 19236319 17701901 21508374 7812570 26657631 17959643 26386597
28743860	Bivariate genome-wide association meta-analysis of pediatric musculoskeletal traits reveals pleiotropic effects at the SREBF1/TOM1L2 locus.	Bone mineral density is known to be a heritable, polygenic trait whereas genetic variants contributing to lean mass variation remain largely unknown. We estimated the shared SNP heritability and performed a bivariate GWAS meta-analysis of total-body lean mass (TB-LM) and total-body less head bone mineral density (TBLH-BMD) regions in 10,414 children. The estimated SNP heritability is 43% (95% CI: 34-52%) for TBLH-BMD, and 39% (95% CI: 30-48%) for TB-LM, with a shared genetic component of 43% (95% CI: 29-56%). We identify variants with pleiotropic effects in eight loci, including seven established bone mineral density loci: WNT4, GALNT3, MEPE, CPED1/WNT16, TNFSF11, RIN3, and PPP6R3/LRP5. Variants in the TOM1L2/SREBF1 locus exert opposing effects TB-LM and TBLH-BMD, and have a stronger association with the former trait. We show that SREBF1 is expressed in murine and human osteoblasts, as well as in human muscle tissue. This is the first bivariate GWAS meta-analysis to demonstrate genetic factors with pleiotropic effects on bone mineral density and lean mass.Bone mineral density and lean skeletal mass are heritable traits. Here, Medina-Gomez and colleagues perform bivariate GWAS analyses of total body lean mass and bone mass density in children, and show genetic loci with pleiotropic effects on both traits.	 8156598 26733130 23988118 21452281 26079878 14757268 21645416 27428752 21169019 24163105 20466885 15746153 24013639 22064851 17967140 12400034 18029498 24316577 24275495 24249740 19922823 26967290 24763738 22748210 22495300 26453500 28724990 25260699 22843982 9421240 18269309 22792071 25385511 21075843 18343975 23737753 26414676 23208849 21444814 19801982 19812512 22792070 22045659 20028734 22504420 27019110 21533022 23074152 20658559 23644456 23226416 21738487 26267216 26367794 17701901 26235824 23108985 20431112 11929849 18271028 23990248 26980276 19960889 18231123 24945404 18455228 25954001 24643965
28937693	Genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and genetic overlap with other health-related traits in UK Biobank (N=112 117).	Alcohol consumption has been linked to over 200 diseases and is responsible for over 5% of the global disease burden. Well-known genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing genes, for example, ALDH2 and ADH1B, are strongly associated with alcohol consumption but have limited impact in European populations where they are found at low frequency. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol consumption in 112 117 individuals in the UK Biobank (UKB) sample of white British individuals. We report significant genome-wide associations at 14 loci. These include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C/ADH5) and two loci in KLB, a gene recently associated with alcohol consumption. We also identify SNPs at novel loci including GCKR, CADM2 and FAM69C. Gene-based analyses found significant associations with genes implicated in the neurobiology of substance use (DRD2, PDE4B). GCTA analyses found a significant SNP-based heritability of self-reported alcohol consumption of 13% (se=0.01). Sex-specific analyses found largely overlapping GWAS loci and the genetic correlation (rG) between male and female alcohol consumption was 0.90 (s.e.=0.09, P-value=7.16 × 10	 23756893 2285844 26365420 22102315 22671516 22333326 21182554 6634831 25171596 24094508 24904269 21968928 15706788 25642630 17014726 25692341 11322030 23948525 25828809 25550326 25869804 27089180 22786799 6829404 17406835 25885710 17485608 20452109 17921519 24881324 26849558 25741455 23737753 26414676 26379859 18235070 27298186 22808013 25982659 14625264 15535450 28270201 15672114 24450588 24166409 8096045 27663502 25826379 8357294 11894976 15692081 17701901 21471458 24094745 18996923 26368830 24359476 27911795 22426310 28228447 21167468 27023175 21381824 19560604 8974313 16710775 27749845 27046643
28753643	Pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of baseline risk factors, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and tolerability endpoints from two large global cardiovascular outcomes trials for darapladib.	Darapladib, a lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) inhibitor, failed to demonstrate efficacy for the primary endpoints in two large phase III cardiovascular outcomes trials, one in stable coronary heart disease patients (STABILITY) and one in acute coronary syndrome (SOLID-TIMI 52). No major safety signals were observed but tolerability issues of diarrhea and odor were common (up to 13%). We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with Lp-PLA2 activity may influence efficacy and tolerability and therefore performed a comprehensive pharmacogenetic analysis of both trials. We genotyped patients within the STABILITY and SOLID-TIMI 52 trials who provided a DNA sample and consent (n = 13,577 and 10,404 respectively, representing 86% and 82% of the trial participants) using genome-wide arrays with exome content and performed imputation using a 1000 Genomes reference panel. We investigated baseline and change from baseline in Lp-PLA2 activity, two efficacy endpoints (major coronary events and myocardial infarction) as well as tolerability parameters at genome-wide and candidate gene level using a meta-analytic approach. We replicated associations of published loci on baseline Lp-PLA2 activity (APOE, CELSR2, LPA, PLA2G7, LDLR and SCARB1) and identified three novel loci (TOMM5, FRMD5 and LPL) using the GWAS-significance threshold P≤5E-08. Review of the PLA2G7 gene (encoding Lp-PLA2) within these datasets identified V279F null allele carriers as well as three other rare exonic null alleles within various ethnic groups, however none of these variants nor any other loci associated with Lp-PLA2 activity at baseline were associated with any of the drug response endpoints. The analysis of darapladib efficacy endpoints, despite low power, identified six low frequency loci with main genotype effect (though with borderline imputation scores) and one common locus (minor allele frequency 0.24) with genotype by treatment interaction effect passing the GWAS-significance threshold. This locus conferred risk in placebo subjects, hazard ratio (HR) 1.22 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.33, but was protective in darapladib subjects, HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.88). No major loci for tolerability were found. Thus, genetic analysis confirmed and extended the influence of lipoprotein loci on Lp-PLA2 levels, identified some novel null alleles in the PLA2G7 gene, and only identified one potentially efficacious subgroup within these two large clinical trials.	 22883141 17463246 23118302 18806801 16503872 22286170 16004595 17587752 10395969 16873290 22138821 26791069 25173516 10591668 17903299 11501940 21107710 19715440 17290721 27940953 15990594 20686565 15731492 26343387 20616382 20926117 23060615 20517342 27329448 9245731 18765397 9472966 14709372 21490708 8675689 10917985 19373214 22843986 16960105 17701901 26972588 20934559 19060906 10781653 11807372 1636183 20442857 20926424 24678955 22003152 21982651 23870195 9799208

28763065	Genome-wide association analysis identifies common variants influencing infant brain volumes.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of adolescents and adults are transforming our understanding of how genetic variants impact brain structure and psychiatric risk, but cannot address the reality that psychiatric disorders are unfolding developmental processes with origins in fetal life. To investigate how genetic variation impacts prenatal brain development, we conducted a GWAS of global brain tissue volumes in 561 infants.

The P wave on an ECG is a measure of atrial electric function, and its characteristics may serve as predictors for atrial arrhythmias. Increased mean P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force traditionally have been used as markers for left atrial enlargement, and both have been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Here, we explore the genetic basis of P-wave morphology through meta-analysis of genome-wide association study results for P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force from 12 cohort studies.	 22194935 6064984 25916567 23183192 21378987 19389651 25607358 23139255 24850809 25124494 15735645 15007004 19213946 20639392 20062061 25055868 24727801 18272008 12952837 15998695 25497248 20215591 21347284 23583979 20062060 20537347 17701901 20656787 24517470 20062063 24360345 22388767 1831587 25035420 24124408

29117387	Two Novel Susceptibility Loci for Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry.	Prostate cancer incidence is 1.6-fold higher in African Americans than in other populations. The risk factors that drive this disparity are unknown and potentially consist of social, environmental, and genetic influences. To investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis using two-sided statistical tests in 10 202 case subjects and 10 810 control subjects. We identified novel signals on chromosomes 13q34 and 22q12, with the risk-associated alleles found only in men of African ancestry (13q34: rs75823044, risk allele frequency = 2.2%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37 to 1.76, P = 6.10 × 10-12; 22q12.1: rs78554043, risk allele frequency = 1.5%, OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.39 to 1.89, P = 7.50 × 10-10). At 13q34, the signal is located 5' of the gene IRS2 and 3' of a long noncoding RNA, while at 22q12 the candidate functional allele is a missense variant in the CHEK2 gene. These findings provide further support for the role of ancestry-specific germline variation in contributing to population differences in prostate cancer risk.	 26034056 16945910 18264096 26823525 19767754 27595995 20676098 27734877 23535732 7559579 24185611 17401364 23104005 25217961 10695593

28800603	Genetic variants specific to aging-related verbal memory: Insights from GWASs in a population-based cohort.	Verbal memory is typically studied using immediate recall (IR) and delayed recall (DR) scores, although DR is dependent on IR capability. Separating these components may be useful for deciphering the genetic variation in age-related memory abilities. This study was conducted to (a) construct individual trajectories in IR and independent aspects of delayed recall, or residualized-DR (rDR), across older adulthood; and (b) identify genetic markers that contribute to four estimated phenotypes: IR and rDR levels and changes after age 60. A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of adults aged 50 and older. Mixed effects regression models were constructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (1996-2012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) were conducted in the genotypic subsample (N = 7,486) using ~1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One SNP (rs2075650) in TOMM40 associated with rDR level at the genome-wide level (p = 5.0x10-08), an effect that replicated in an independent sample from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (N = 6,898 with 41,328 observations). Meta-analysis of rDR level confirmed the association (p = 5.0x10-11) and identified two others in TOMM40 (rs71352238 p = 1.0x10-10; rs157582 p = 7.0x10-09), and one in APOE (rs769449 p = 3.1 x10-12). Meta-analysis of IR change identified associations with three of the same SNPs in TOMM40 (rs157582 p = 8.3x10-10; rs71352238 p = 1.9x10-09) and APOE (rs769449 p = 2.2x10-08). Conditional analyses indicate GWAS signals on rDR level were driven by APOE, whereas signals on IR change were driven by TOMM40. Additionally, we found that TOMM40 had effects independent of APOE e4 on both phenotypes. Findings from this first U.S. population-based GWAS study conducted on both age-related immediate and delayed verbal memory merit continued examination in other samples and additional measures of verbal memory.	 24508314 10467585 10869235 17194218 26742953 16862161 25598848 22710966 11754475 11838535 23102119 20718045 12214310 12227921 12061405 8527064 9153028 18196181 19404731 7168798 20044193 24448547 20832485 24903779 6037305 15656733 25862420 11806695 12470696 21784354 10488814 18161052 17053149 22710912 17029783 21893661 2001185 23734114 9848808 10363039 20616382 25722852 15716907 21743047 23288655 25360018 18852203 21835680 25666727 15769210 24956007 22863908 21463045 8801636 12603244 14735112 21460840 17032541 18758442 9339305 16184483 26139635 20029386 16783130 23207651 11756601 9803018 1459160 19294424 14512830 12508255 11752477 23390181 23333464 20634204 16537568 20548291 23143611 17701901 25567624 26187033 21167468 25044051 17874952 2239105 23871114 14674836 11838538 17434289 19225597
28843169	The low single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of plasma and saliva cortisol levels.	Cortisol is an important stress hormone affected by a variety of biological and environmental factors, such as the circadian rhythm, exercise and psychological stress. Cortisol is mostly measured using blood or saliva samples. A number of genetic variants have been found to contribute to cortisol levels with these methods. While the effects of several specific single genetic variants is known, the joint genome-wide contribution to cortisol levels is unclear. Our aim was to estimate the amount of cortisol variance explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e. the SNP heritability, using a variety of cortisol measures, cohorts and analysis approaches. We analyzed morning plasma (n=5705) and saliva levels (n=1717), as well as diurnal saliva levels (n=1541), in the Rotterdam Study using genomic restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, linkage disequilibrium score regression was fitted on the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed by the CORNET consortium on morning plasma cortisol (n=12,597) and saliva cortisol (n=7703). No significant SNP heritability was detected for any cortisol measure, sample or analysis approach. Point estimates ranged from 0% to 9%. Morning plasma cortisol in the CORNET cohorts, the sample with the most power, had a 6% [95%CI: 0-13%] SNP heritability. The results consistently suggest a low SNP heritability of these acute and short-term measures of cortisol. The low SNP heritability may reflect the substantial environmental and, in particular, situational component of these cortisol measures. Future GWAS will require very large sample sizes. Alternatively, more long-term cortisol measures such as hair cortisol samples are needed to discover further genetic pathways regulating cortisol concentrations.	
28808816	A genome-wide association study of cognitive function in Chinese adult twins.	Multiple loci or genes have been identified using genome-wide association studies mainly in western countries but with inconsistent results. No similar studies have been conducted in the world's largest and rapidly aging Chinese population. The paper aimed to identify the specific genetic variants associated with cognitive function in middle and old-aged Chinese dizygotic twins (DZ). Cognitive function was measured on 139 pairs of DZ by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The subjects were genotyped at 1048575 SNP positions. Regression-based mixed-effect kinship model of GWAS was conducted to test the SNPs. Gene-based analysis was performed on VEGAS2. The statistically significant genes were then subject to gene set enrichment analysis to further identify the specific biological pathways associated with cognitive function. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance although there were 13 SNPs of suggestive significance (P < 10	
28806749	Defining the genetic susceptibility to cervical neoplasia-A genome-wide association study.	A small percentage of women with cervical HPV infection progress to cervical neoplasia, and the risk factors determining progression are incompletely understood. We sought to define the genetic loci involved in cervical neoplasia and to assess its heritability using unbiased unrelated case/control statistical approaches. We demonstrated strong association of cervical neoplasia with risk and protective HLA haplotypes that are determined by the amino-acids carried at positions 13 and 71 in pocket 4 of HLA-DRB1 and position 156 in HLA-B. Furthermore, 36% (standard error 2.4%) of liability of HPV-associated cervical pre-cancer and cancer is determined by common genetic variants. Women in the highest 10% of genetic risk scores have approximately >7.1% risk, and those in the highest 5% have approximately >21.6% risk, of developing cervical neoplasia. Future studies should examine genetic risk prediction in assessing the risk of cervical neoplasia further, in combination with other screening methods.	 20084279 20464545 26241630 14660243 24700089 12195346 19638646 17366619 12499305 23762245 24390348 18451182 25528152 11097225 16835346 11072236 19012493 12426567 21471563 15630470 10446440 19446866 17357107 23482656 21173650 21743469 12692554 24995157 11979442 23817570 19151717 12634637 17701901 19625214 24403192 25341114 21167468 21602310 18940314 24963154 9048832 15818615 27749845
28809852	The SNP-set based association study identifies ITGA1 as a susceptibility gene of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Han Chinese.	Genome-wide association studies, which detect the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease susceptibility, have been extensively applied to study attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but genome-wide significant associations have not been found yet. Genetic heterogeneity and insufficient genomic coverage may account for the missing heritability. We performed a two-stage association study for ADHD in the Han Chinese population. In the discovery stage, 1033 ADHD patients and 950 healthy controls were genotyped using both the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. The genotyped SNPs were combined to generate a powerful SNP set with better genomic coverage especially for the nonsynonymous variants. In addition to the association of single SNPs, we collected adjacent SNPs as SNP sets, which were determined by either genes or successive sliding windows, to evaluate their synergetic effect. The candidate susceptibility SNPs were further replicated in an independent cohort of 1441 ADHD patients and 1447 healthy controls. No genome-wide significant SNPs or gene-based SNP sets were found to be associated with ADHD. However, two continuous sliding windows located in ITGA1 (P-value=8.33E-7 and P-value=8.43E-7) were genome-wide significant. The quantitative trait analyses also demonstrated their association with ADHD core symptoms and executive functions. The association was further validated by follow-up replications for four selected SNPs: rs1979398 (P-value=2.64E-6), rs16880453 (P-value=3.58E-4), rs1531545 (P-value=7.62E-4) and rs4074793 (P-value=2.03E-4). Our results suggest that genetic variants in ITGA1 may be involved in the etiology of ADHD and the SNP-set based analysis is a promising strategy for the detection of underlying genetic risk factors.	 26268243 27189265 22495306 24448550 18081024 20560208 15972070 25363768 22795700 18821565 26184070 25363760 27004716 14564503 20616382 20159345 16415888 18839057 20098435 25631608 18579810 20598278 22001757 23874508 27754487 23728934 9603370 20150074 20732625 17572784 11682119 17701901 26819946 22513993 26515609 23658731 23684009 20601685 14685227
28828242	Genome-wide association study identifies novel type II diabetes risk loci in Jordan subpopulations.	The prevalence of Type II Diabetes (T2D) has been increasing and has become a disease of significant public health burden in Jordan. None of the previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have specifically investigated the Middle East populations. The Circassian and Chechen communities in Jordan represent unique populations that are genetically distinct from the Arab population and other populations in the Caucasus. Prevalence of T2D is very high in both the Circassian and Chechen communities in Jordan despite low obesity prevalence. We conducted GWAS on T2D in these two populations and further performed meta-analysis of the results.

28817678	Family-based exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia among Hispanics confirms role of ARID5B in susceptibility.	We conducted an exome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among Hispanics to confirm and identify novel variants associated with disease risk in this population. We used a case-parent trio study design; unlike more commonly used case-control studies, this study design is ideal for avoiding issues with population stratification bias among this at-risk ethnic group. Using 710 individuals from 323 Guatemalan and US Hispanic families, two inherited SNPs in ARID5B reached genome-wide level significance: rs10821936, RR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.70-3.14, p = 1.7×10-8 and rs7089424, RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.64-3.01, p = 5.2×10-8. Similar results were observed when restricting our analyses to those with the B-ALL subtype: ARID5B rs10821936 RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.02, p = 9.63×10-8 and ARID5B rs7089424 RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.57-2.88, p = 2.81×10-7. Notably, effect sizes observed for rs7089424 and rs10821936 in our study were >20% higher than those reported among non-Hispanic white populations in previous genetic association studies. Our results confirmed the role of ARID5B in childhood ALL susceptibility among Hispanics; however, our assessment did not reveal any strong novel inherited genetic risks for acute lymphoblastic leukemia among this ethnic group.	 22419666 24013273 17503334 18064533 22076464 9529360 10835412 22738121 23996088 20453839 21753830 27529658 22660188 25468567 22064851 19684604 20395969 11308071 24800985 14559954 18074355 22086414 12598158 9801020 23233609 19684603 23512250 25138779 20460642 15071128 20634204 24707947 21297632 25112189 23615557 21181895 24141364 17986460
28820441	Genome-Wide Interaction Study of Omega-3 PUFAs and Other Fatty Acids on Inflammatory Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Health in the Framingham Heart Study.	Numerous genetic loci have been identified as being associated with circulating fatty acid (FA) levels and/or inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular health (e.g., C-reactive protein). Recently, using red blood cell (RBC) FA data from the Framingham Offspring Study, we conducted a genome-wide association study of over 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 22 RBC FAs (and associated ratios), including the four Omega-3 FAs (ALA, DHA, DPA, and EPA). Our analyses identified numerous causal loci. In this manuscript, we investigate the extent to which polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels moderate the relationship of genetics to cardiovascular health biomarkers using a genome-wide interaction study approach. In particular, we test for possible gene-FA interactions on 9 inflammatory biomarkers, with 2.5 million SNPs and 12 FAs, including all Omega-3 PUFAs. We identified eighteen novel loci, including loci which demonstrate strong evidence of modifying the impact of heritable genetics on biomarker levels, and subsequently cardiovascular health. The identified genes provide increased clarity on the biological functioning and role of Omega-3 PUFAs, as well as other common fatty acids, in cardiovascular health, and suggest numerous candidate loci for future replication and biological characterization.	 24981077 23741290 20852092 16900203 19421317 19033007 25786118 21688154 20031568 17665981 27111519 22727409 27571263 26055507 27341449 16159603 21479357 22253303 17903291 26078757 27877049 20145438 20031590 17634253 22064162 20551373 21829377 24777981 22359512 24126178 18673009 23076616 28491088 18852200 27021288 28391879 27694958 25890600 23505291 22659391 26247967 21507922 24453077 19010253 23726511 20634204 22613931 22748167 25573147 23400010 10769275 22371413 23251661 19185299 14717057 18522621 21081504 25500335 25897795 23968978 24323631 27434045 16477172
28836065	A multi-stage genome-wide association study of uterine fibroids in African Americans.	Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus affecting up to 77% of women by menopause. They are the leading indication for hysterectomy, and account for $34 billion annually in the United States. Race/ethnicity and age are the strongest known risk factors. African American (AA) women have higher prevalence, earlier onset, and larger and more numerous fibroids than European American women. We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of fibroid risk among AA women followed by in silico genetically predicted gene expression profiling of top hits. In Stage 1, cases and controls were confirmed by pelvic imaging, genotyped and imputed to 1000 Genomes. Stage 2 used self-reported fibroid and GWAS data from 23andMe, Inc. and the Black Women's Health Study. Associations with fibroid risk were modeled using logistic regression adjusted for principal components, followed by meta-analysis of results. We observed a significant association among 3399 AA cases and 4764 AA controls at rs739187 (risk-allele frequency = 0.27) in CYTH4 (OR (95% confidence interval) = 1.23 (1.16-1.30), p value = 7.82 × 10	 15824551 21347282 25495367 21293383 15218005 23956302 16862161 18357799 22044079 23891629 24210251 22155802 22138821 25954002 26040208 22666423 26862846 20443953 11159139 17572673 23040493 25240857 12606893 20616382 23161897 19459228 3204420 20467159 24449056 26484571 17988198 26236334 21460842 24709693 17917603 15738025 19019355 17090618 23604678 17701901 9397113 10023416 26258848 12548202 24690197 24516594 11099869 25954001 18321499 25455875

28776340	ABCG2 Polymorphism Is Associated with Hyperuricemia in a Study of a Community-Based Korean Cohort.	The purpose of the present study was to find novel loci associated with hyperuricemia using data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on healthy Koreans. We conducted a GWAS using data from a community-based cohort study where 3,647 subjects aged 40-89 were recruited by the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH). The community-based cohort consisted of subjects who did not suffer from any of 6 major diseases (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, heart diseases, brain diseases, and cancers). Epidemiologic information includes 249 traits such as epidemiological surveys, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. A total of 3,647 participants, including 234 hyperuricemia cases (serum uric acid [SUA] level was 7 mg/dL or higher) and 3,413 controls, were genotyped by Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip GWAS array at KNIH. In the multivariate regression analysis of clinical variables, significant variables associated with hyperuricemia were male gender (odds ratio [OR], 5.526; P = 3.2 × 10⁻¹⁰), old age (OR, 1.017; P = 0.040), high body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.147; P = 5.4 × 10⁻⁷), current alcohol intake (OR, 2.413; P = 4.7 × 10⁻⁷), and high creatinine (OR, 1.647; P = 1.6 × 10⁻¹³). We identified a hyperuricemia susceptible loci (rs2054576 in ABCG2, OR, 1.883; P = 4.7 × 10⁻⁸) that passed a genome-wide significance threshold, adjusted by clinical variables (male, age, BMI, current alcohol, and creatinine). It was first identified that rs2054576 in ABCG2 is associated with hyperuricemia. Our results should be validated through replication studies among other Korean subjects or various ethnic groups.	 24499401 22229870 20368174 25639607 19506252 24777469 23584883 24408252 24929540 22945592 25608828 22038265 24513273 24021215 19890391 22797727 25705163 20359726 19503597 20516647 18834626 23263486 25646370 20421215 23852331 20634204 20139978 22609445 22513714 17701901 19921266 23703922 22132951 18348202 18256235 20858603 21768215 21983786 23238572 23552988

28871152	Genome-Wide Association Study of Blood Pressure Traits by Hispanic/Latino Background: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Hypertension prevalence varies between ethnic groups, possibly due to differences in genetic, environmental, and cultural determinants. Hispanic/Latino Americans are a diverse and understudied population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of blood pressure (BP) traits in 12,278 participants from the Hispanics Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). In the discovery phase we identified eight previously unreported BP loci. In the replication stage, we tested these loci in the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study of admixed Southern Brazilians, the COGENT-BP study of African descent, women of European descent from the Women Health Initiative (WHI), and a sample of European descent from the UK Biobank. No loci met the Bonferroni-adjusted level of statistical significance (0.0024). Two loci had marginal evidence of replication: rs78701042 (NGF) with diastolic BP (P = 0.008 in the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study), and rs7315692 (SLC5A8) with systolic BP (P = 0.007 in European ancestry replication). We investigated whether previously reported loci associated with BP in studies of European, African, and Asian ancestry generalize to Hispanics/Latinos. Overall, 26% of the known associations in studies of individuals of European and Chinese ancestries generalized, while only a single association previously discovered in a people of African descent generalized.	 20609343 26390057 27018471 19304780 23128226 24627442 20718045 23245609 24165912 11040222 19609347 17309936 20727787 23972371 27618447 14575939 19430479 14631557 20609344 10319585 19140131 27256683 22276822 16373375 12493255 25249183 18922396 21058334 25733577 8898761 27618448 23269371 27618452 18348202 21909115 28135244 28090672 14614392 27841878 19543373 27736895 26748518
28869590	Identification of new susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes and shared etiological pathways with coronary heart disease.	To evaluate the shared genetic etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we conducted a genome-wide, multi-ancestry study of genetic variation for both diseases in up to 265,678 subjects for T2D and 260,365 subjects for CHD. We identify 16 previously unreported loci for T2D and 1 locus for CHD, including a new T2D association at a missense variant in HLA-DRB5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). We show that genetically mediated increase in T2D risk also confers higher CHD risk. Joint T2D-CHD analysis identified eight variants-two of which are coding-where T2D and CHD associations appear to colocalize, including a new joint T2D-CHD association at the CCDC92 locus that also replicated for T2D. The variants associated with both outcomes implicate new pathways as well as targets of existing drugs, including icosapent ethyl and adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein.	 26432245 23703215 24894501 22941192 25825043 21892160 19404752 26074316 27487401 25939054 28566273 9363890 18762020 8910278 26073397 12377750 21249183 24316577 25948681 26017687 26343387 25857751 20616382 26702093 23263489 22819432 9430630 26414676 20167359 19557189 25262344 19430480 24630390 21366474 24509480 17554340 10610182 27252175 17701901 25673412 24336170 22426310 22479202 24097068 11385507 26905861 12939343 24203711 22885922 19543373 27908689 25954001 12689998
28869591	Identification of 153 new loci associated with heel bone mineral density and functional involvement of GPC6 in osteoporosis.	Osteoporosis is a common disease diagnosed primarily by measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 142,487 individuals from the UK Biobank to identify loci associated with BMD as estimated by quantitative ultrasound of the heel. We identified 307 conditionally independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that attained genome-wide significance at 203 loci, explaining approximately 12% of the phenotypic variance. These included 153 previously unreported loci, and several rare variants with large effect sizes. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we undertook (1) bioinformatic, functional genomic annotation and human osteoblast expression studies; (2) gene-function prediction; (3) skeletal phenotyping of 120 knockout mice with deletions of genes adjacent to lead independent SNPs; and (4) analysis of gene expression in mouse osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts.

Genome-wide association studies are a powerful tool for searching for disease susceptibility loci. Several studies identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) connected intimately to the onset of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been published, but there are few reports of genome-wide association studies in Japan. To identify genetic variants that modify the risk of CRC oncogenesis, especially in the Japanese population, we performed a multi-stage genome-wide association study using a large number of samples: 1846 CRC cases and 2675 controls. We identified 4 SNP (rs7912831, rs4749812, rs7898455 and rs10905453) in chromosome region 10p14 associated with CRC; however, there are no coding or non-coding genes within this region of fairly extensive linkage disequilibrium (a 500-kb block) on 10p14. Our study revealed that the 10p14 locus is significantly correlated with susceptibility to CRC in the Japanese population, in accordance with the results of multiple studies in other races.	 19561604 25023989 18084292 21655089 24743840 24390711 24978480 23717594 19857256 25105248 21242260 8960139 22634755 23263487 17572673 18172290 26885031 19011631 22976378 17483957 26498495 27661122 22434246 26404086 20972440 17618283 24836286 17618284 21761138 25990418 26965516 24737748 21632853 18372905 17934461 18372901 26515597
28878392	Multivariate discovery and replication of five novel loci associated with Immunoglobulin G N-glycosylation.	Joint modeling of a number of phenotypes using multivariate methods has often been neglected in genome-wide association studies and if used, replication has not been sought. Modern omics technologies allow characterization of functional phenomena using a large number of related phenotype measures, which can benefit from such joint analysis. Here, we report a multivariate genome-wide association studies of 23 immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation phenotypes. In the discovery cohort, our multi-phenotype method uncovers ten genome-wide significant loci, of which five are novel (IGH, ELL2, HLA-B-C, AZI1, FUT6-FUT3). We convincingly replicate all novel loci via multivariate tests. We show that IgG N-glycosylation loci are strongly enriched for genes expressed in the immune system, in particular antibody-producing cells and B lymphocytes. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of multivariate methods to discover novel, reproducible pleiotropic effects.Multivariate analysis methods can uncover the relationship between phenotypic measures characterised by modern omic techniques. Here the authors conduct a multivariate GWAS on IgG N-glycosylation phenotypes and identify 5 novel loci enriched in immune system genes.	 22034591 11780939 24857970 11315092 22303408 16888140 17384015 19260141 25597830 21908519 22567092 25613900 16973733 27005778 23752797 19019849 17572673 18177457 20686565 23088889 26076425 26184070 17660554 19158813 22916037 27347381 23382691 24531419 23799013 18760389 18327257 23861737 21203500 1290021 24097068 2338269 19749764 9806640

28886140	Male-specific association of the FCGR2A His167Arg polymorphism with Kawasaki disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that can potentially cause coronary artery aneurysms in some children. KD occurs approximately 1.5 times more frequently in males than in females. To identify sex-specific genetic variants that are involved in KD pathogenesis in children, we performed a sex-stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS), using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (249 cases and 1,000 controls) and a replication study for the 34 sex-specific candidate SNPs in an independent sample set (671 cases and 3,553 controls). Male-specific associations were detected in three common variants: rs1801274 in FCGR2A [odds ratio (OR) = 1.40, P = 9.31 × 10-5], rs12516652 in SEMA6A (OR = 1.87, P = 3.12 × 10-4), and rs5771303 near IL17REL (OR = 1.57, P = 2.53 × 10-5). The male-specific association of FCGR2A, but not SEMA6A and IL17REL, was also replicated in a Japanese population (OR = 1.74, P = 1.04 × 10-4 in males vs. OR = 1.22, P = 0.191 in females). In a meta-analysis with 1,461 cases and 5,302 controls, a very strong association of KD with the nonsynonymous SNP rs1801274 (p.His167Arg, previously assigned as p.His131Arg) in FCGR2A was confirmed in males (OR = 1.48, P = 1.43 × 10-7), but not in the females (OR = 1.17, P = 0.055). The present study demonstrates that p.His167Arg, a KD-associated FCGR2A variant, acts as a susceptibility gene in males only. Overall, the gender differences associated with FCGR2A in KD provide a new insight into KD susceptibility.	 22447211 22446962 22105492 22081228 25093412 26920472 1401085 3802833 23740775 27510389 23024280 7875742 19237439 26497525 24793874 27589061 19575028 22431266 12958120 20228798 26089602 23012250 26480299 22446961 16436660 23517907 19915573 24944465 25470559 1428496 9437284 13655060 25720438 20104198 24958858 15313941 19002143 17701901 1532589 22777942 15505111 18625544 21221998 21732179 15771703 10331870 18064051 11343485 26111818

28898252	Impact of common genetic determinants of Hemoglobin A1c on type 2 diabetes risk and diagnosis in ancestrally diverse populations: A transethnic genome-wide meta-analysis.	Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is used to diagnose type 2 diabetes (T2D) and assess glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 18 HbA1c-associated genetic variants. These variants proved to be classifiable by their likely biological action as erythrocytic (also associated with erythrocyte traits) or glycemic (associated with other glucose-related traits). In this study, we tested the hypotheses that, in a very large scale GWAS, we would identify more genetic variants associated with HbA1c and that HbA1c variants implicated in erythrocytic biology would affect the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c. We therefore expanded the number of HbA1c-associated loci and tested the effect of genetic risk-scores comprised of erythrocytic or glycemic variants on incident diabetes prediction and on prevalent diabetes screening performance. Throughout this multiancestry study, we kept a focus on interancestry differences in HbA1c genetics performance that might influence race-ancestry differences in health outcomes.	 20858683 11315092 24647736 22876189 4889647 22290723 20200384 28170391 2445253 17943122 22125221 20547905 27979889 24244560 17536077 24733192 19096518 21148304 20067953 22139419 20616382 18523629 5333234 21873549 23774735 20978092 11159762 22283416 24246264 19380854 22581228 22885924 20849430 20139978 19703808 23429543 23222517 18348202 22426310 21788574 21167468 28170479 20081857

28921602	Human leukocyte antigen variants and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma modified by hepatitis C virus genotypes: A genome-wide association study.	We conducted a genome-wide association study to discover genetic variants associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We genotyped 502 HCC cases and 749 non-HCC controls using the Axiom-CHB genome-wide array. After identifying single-nucleotide polymorphism clusters located in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which were potentially associated with HCC, HLA-DQB1 genotyping was performed to analyze 994 anti-HCV seropositives collected in the period 1991-2013 in a community-based cohort for evaluating long-term predictability of HLA variants for identifying the risk of HCC. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of HLA genotypes for determining the aforementioned HCC risk. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the proximity of HLA-DQB1 were associated with HCC (P < 8.7 × 10	
28921760	Genome-wide association study of a nicotine metabolism biomarker in African American smokers: impact of chromosome 19 genetic influences.	The activity of CYP2A6, the major nicotine-inactivating enzyme, is measurable in smokers using the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine). Due to its role in nicotine clearance, the NMR is associated with smoking behaviours and response to pharmacotherapies. The NMR is highly heritable (~80%), and on average lower in African Americans (AA) versus whites. We previously identified several reduce and loss-of-function CYP2A6 variants common in individuals of African descent. Our current aim was to identify novel genetic influences on the NMR in AA smokers using genome-wide approaches.	 18388868 11106261 27035242 16862161 22384356 16872570 27488534 15229465 22547082 17112802 24305170 27832052 16952495 25588294 27712845 18559554 21266057 15592323 23674838 24402139 19000709 16765148 18216723 24676348 27113016 20554984 26407342 22282543 20336063 26670214 17322544 8801636 26014804 19184645 21747048 27918784 19365400 19845430 22334123 25112433 11854334 25653097 19300303 27101133 20418889 17701901 22971134 24094745 24743097 25012994 16696632 19543373 16436765 26340336 18360915 8937855 8627511

28924203	The common variants implicated in microstructural abnormality of first episode and drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia.	Both post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have identified abnormal white matter (WM) microstructure in patients with schizophrenia. However, its genetic underpinnings and relevant biological pathways remain unclear. In order to unravel the genes and the pathways associated with abnormal WM microstructure in schizophrenia, we recruited 100 first-episode, drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia and 140 matched healthy controls to conduct genome-wide association analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) value measured using diffusing tensor imaging (DTI), followed by multivariate association study and pathway enrichment analysis.

29036319	Discovery of susceptibility loci associated with tuberculosis in Han Chinese.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed the worldwide heterogeneity of genetic factors in tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility. Despite having the third highest global TB burden, no TB-related GWAS has been performed in China. Here, we performed the first three-stage GWAS on TB in the Han Chinese population. In the stage 1 (discovery stage), after quality control, 691 388 SNPs present in 972 TB patients and 1537 controls were retained. After replication on an additional 3460 TB patients and 4862 controls (stages 2 and 3), we identified three significant loci associated with TB, the most significant of which was rs4240897 (logistic regression P = 1.41 × 10-11, odds ratio = 0.79). The aforementioned three SNPs were harbored by MFN2, RGS12 and human leukocyte antigen class II beta chain paralogue encoding genes, all of which are candidate immune genes associated with TB. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic background of TB in the Han Chinese population.

28957384	Two genetic loci associated with ankle injury.	Ankle injuries, including sprains, strains and other joint derangements and instability, are common, especially for athletes involved in indoor court or jumping sports. Identifying genetic loci associated with these ankle injuries could shed light on their etiologies. A genome-wide association screen was performed using publicly available data from the Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH) including 1,694 cases of ankle injury and 97,646 controls. An indel (chr21:47156779:D) that lies close to a collagen gene, COL18A1, showed an association with ankle injury at genome-wide significance (p = 3.8x10-8; OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.75-2.23). A second DNA variant (rs13286037 on chromosome 9) that lies within an intron of the transcription factor gene NFIB showed an association that was nearly genome-wide significant (p = 5.1x10-8; OR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.46-1.80). The ACTN3 R577X mutation was previously reported to show an association with acute ankle sprains, but did not show an association in this cohort. This study is the first genome-wide screen for ankle injury that yields insights regarding the genetic etiology of ankle injuries and provides DNA markers with the potential to inform athletes about their genetic risk for ankle injury.	 22384356 28358823 10569362 7590749 22820512 26686553 22253303 17786212 22955616 27543408 9974196 16415888 28482362 10936052 12852262 24105612 26502412 25687200 22663078 28521375 21490505 21565264 20234392 8188291 19543373 21795671 25954001 17190537 20547668

29228715	Bayesian and frequentist analysis of an Austrian genome-wide association study of colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas.	Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were analyzed using single marker tests in combination with stringent correction procedures for multiple testing. Thus, a substantial proportion of associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remained undetected and may account for missing heritability in complex traits. Model selection procedures present a powerful alternative to identify associated SNPs in high-dimensional settings. In this GWAS including 1060 colorectal cancer cases, 689 cases of advanced colorectal adenomas and 4367 controls we pursued a dual approach to investigate genome-wide associations with disease risk applying both, single marker analysis and model selection based on the modified Bayesian information criterion, mBIC2, implemented in the software package MOSGWA.

This study extends those findings by analyzing the ancestry- and sex-specific AD-stratified effects on RSB. We examined the concordance of findings for the AD-stratified GWAS and the GW-GxAD analysis of RSB, with concordance defined as genome-wide significance in one analysis and at least nominal significance in the second analysis. A total of 2,173 African-American (AA) and 1,751 European-American (EA) subjects were investigated. Information regarding RSB (lifetime experiences of unprotected sex and multiple sexual partners) and DSM-IV diagnosis of lifetime AD were derived from the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). In our ancestry- and sex-specific analyses, we identified four independent genome-wide significant (GWS) loci (p < 5*10	 22384356 24448210 23643377 28335735 19515289 21940822 23319000 27752767 28745446 27089180 24634552 28265120 21045073 24624106 19033363 20607790 25518859 10915126 27973554 23903073 20616382 22952603 24408308 23663970 28349588 20038610 22067443 8627271 26458734 27531626 28672076 22472876 27129937 19800813 25203924 24166409 23958962 28115739 24741044 18980221 25153362 28473910 27187070 19342616 20040588 26267224 28745447 21448230 15082785 24950638 15896927
28991256	Genome-wide association analysis identifies 30 new susceptibility loci for schizophrenia.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with replication in 36,180 Chinese individuals and performed further transancestry meta-analyses with data from the Psychiatry Genomics Consortium (PGC2). Approximately 95% of the genome-wide significant (GWS) index alleles (or their proxies) from the PGC2 study were overrepresented in Chinese schizophrenia cases, including ∼50% that achieved nominal significance and ∼75% that continued to be GWS in the transancestry analysis. The Chinese-only analysis identified seven GWS loci; three of these also were GWS in the transancestry analyses, which identified 109 GWS loci, thus yielding a total of 113 GWS loci (30 novel) in at least one of these analyses. We observed improvements in the fine-mapping resolution at many susceptibility loci. Our results provide several lines of evidence supporting candidate genes at many loci and highlight some pathways for further research. Together, our findings provide novel insight into the genetic architecture and biological etiology of schizophrenia.	 27167520 19571809 27922604 25693563 17194218 21926974 11399432 23933821 16862161 23974872 22683681 23128226 15279046 25597830 22138821 26698217 25056061 20485568 25642630 24013639 22064851 25439723 27668389 17078926 22714935 25885710 25599223 17572673 26189819 21565292 20881960 22207632 27399966 12958120 26551672 16415888 24608321 20832056 23983478 22649501 22037552 21791550 26414676 24712986 26206863 19571808 27019110 20195266 23954163 22709448 24695403 24762786 23085507 17701901 23269371 21407268 25609598 19501919 21167468 15277450 22037555 20714348 18642345 19571811 18560438 25886982 25363779 19543373 25954001
29030101	Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis in multiple populations identifies new loci for peanut allergy and establishes C11orf30/EMSY as a genetic risk factor for food allergy.	Peanut allergy (PA) is a complex disease with both environmental and genetic risk factors.

Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) is an autoimmune disease of skin and joints with heterogeneity in epidemiologic and genetic landscapes of global populations. We conducted an initial genome-wide association study and a replication study of PsV in the Japanese population (606 PsV cases and 2,052 controls). We identified significant associations of the single nucleotide polymorphisms with PsV risk at TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1and the major histocompatibility complex region (P = 3.7 × 10	
29030599	Genome-wide meta-analysis associates HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA and lifestyle factors with human longevity.	Genomic analysis of longevity offers the potential to illuminate the biology of human aging. Here, using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA). We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Next we show that giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan while susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD), cigarettes smoked per day, lung cancer, insulin resistance and body fat are most negatively correlated. We suggest that the effect of education on lifespan is principally mediated through smoking while the effect of obesity appears to act via CAD. Using instrumental variables, we suggest that an increase of one body mass index unit reduces lifespan by 7 months while 1 year of education adds 11 months to expected lifespan.Variability in human longevity is genetically influenced. Using genetic data of parental lifespan, the authors identify associations at HLA-DQA/DRB1 and LPA and find that genetic variants that increase educational attainment have a positive effect on lifespan whereas increasing BMI negatively affects lifespan.	 20304771 27938824 26912274 24799767 8786073 25199915 21612516 27318201 27029810 20230275 2956279 26192919 27423262 19196970 22493691 18765803 26626624 20616382 24390342 27074913 21300955 24622370 26414676 19430480 24688116 26139635 9778168 27015805 21418511 17554300 27663502 24762786 25660550 25826379 19525953 17701901 20511445 24008273 27618452 26677855 20032323 27599814 21378988 21909115 26766619 19198610 25751625 25262443 28033196 23732715
29016859	A functional variant in MIR4300HG, the host gene of microRNA MIR4300 is associated with progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting millions of children. Since treatment and prognosis of AIS depend on curve progression, identifying factors related to AIS curve progression is important in its management. Although several genetic loci for AIS occurrence are reported, no locus for curve progression has been identified. To identify genes associated with AIS progression, we conducted a genome-wide association study followed by a replication study using a total of 2,543 AIS subjects who were evaluated for the curve progression. We identified a significantly associated locus on chromosome 11q14.1 (P = 1.98 × 10-9, odds ratio = 1.56). In silico and in vitro analyses identified a functional variant, rs35333564 in MIR4300HG, the host gene of a microRNA, MIR4300. The genomic region containing rs35333564 had enhancer activity, which was decreased in its risk allele. Our data suggest that decrease of MIR4300 is related to AIS progression.	
29051540	Genome-wide association study identifies the SERPINB gene cluster as a susceptibility locus for food allergy.	Genetic factors and mechanisms underlying food allergy are largely unknown. Due to heterogeneity of symptoms a reliable diagnosis is often difficult to make. Here, we report a genome-wide association study on food allergy diagnosed by oral food challenge in 497 cases and 2387 controls. We identify five loci at genome-wide significance, the clade B serpin (SERPINB) gene cluster at 18q21.3, the cytokine gene cluster at 5q31.1, the filaggrin gene, the C11orf30/LRRC32 locus, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Stratifying the results for the causative food demonstrates that association of the HLA locus is peanut allergy-specific whereas the other four loci increase the risk for any food allergy. Variants in the SERPINB gene cluster are associated with SERPINB10 expression in leukocytes. Moreover, SERPINB genes are highly expressed in the esophagus. All identified loci are involved in immunological regulation or epithelial barrier function, emphasizing the role of both mechanisms in food allergy.	 27548312 7918016 26542096 2427596 24117770 10887305 15144462 20167617 23727859 9548481 25710614 27268795 26317211 26786172 25642630 12499305 22064851 21429916 21892150 23443026 27571263 15618462 19169254 23128233 17898169 24316577 23630350 22981205 15711639 19589816 12177636 27883235 23329114 21377035 24909706 24816523 20616382 25111616 16238792 25620273 28260260 7594540 16308410 9515587 25174864 27109612 25769611 21377036 24564528 16550169 23334152 26139635 23195525 21907864 26806049 12421571 17701901 15677460 24207119 26482879 23269371 25431330 22243964 19349984 21215659 22197932 17030239 25954001

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with high mortality, uncertain cause, and few treatment options. Studies have identified a significant genetic risk associated with the development of IPF; however, mechanisms by which genetic risk factors promote IPF remain unclear. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility and provide mechanistic insight using gene and protein expression analyses.	 23872052 27548312 16710477 19211510 11290559 17549752 26512610 20935110 23583980 24836312 23783374 27103349 16469733 24058608 3875162 27266705 16670278 8778339 19147812 25217476 25848748 17572673 20952439 24652950 20696764 27799632 21525528 26423011 23209423 24836310 11546812 10480888 12435612 21471066 24429156 23936167 27139517 17717200 24948432 26744410 7706493 23695349 18835860 20656946 24628285 24269843 26177183 26121088 20139090 12239094 11790668 11991887 23090968 25395505
29064910	A molecular pathway analysis informs the genetic risk for arrhythmias during antipsychotic treatment.	Arrhythmias are a frequent and potentially fatal side effect of antipsychotic treatment. Strict ECG monitoring and clinical interviews are the standards used to prevent arrhythmias. A biologic predictive tool is missing. The identification of a genetic makeup at risk of antipsychotic-induced arrhythmias is the aim of the present investigation. The aim of this study was to identify a molecular pathway enriched in single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with antipsychotic-induced QTc modifications. In total, 661 schizophrenic individuals from the CATIE study, M=486 (73.52%), mean age=40.92±11.02, were included. QTc variation was measured as a phase-specific change-created variable. A nested mixed regression for a repeated-measures model served in R for the analysis of the clinical and treatment-related covariates and molecular pathway analysis. Plink was used for the genetic genome-wide analysis. Quality checking was the standard (genotype call rate>0.95; minor allele frequency>0.01; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium<0.0001) and the inflation factor was controlled by λ values. Quetiapine and perphenazine were associated with QTc variation during phase 1. No other significant association was detected. No significant inflation was detected. A number of molecular pathways were associated with QT variation at a conservative (adjusted) P value less than 0.05, including pathways related to neuronal wiring and collagen biosynthesis, along with pathways related to K+ currents and cardiac contraction. Pathways related to neuronal wiring, collagen biosynthesis, and ion currents were identified as possibly involved in QTc modifications during antispsychotic treatment in SKZ patients.

29229094	No genetic association detected with mepolizumab efficacy in severe asthma.	Treatment with mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5, reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations and the requirement for systemic glucocorticoids while maintaining asthma control. Treatment decisions are guided by predictors of response, including blood eosinophil thresholds in patients with frequent exacerbations despite intensive anti-inflammatory and controller treatment. Identification of additional predictors of response could aid treatment decisions. We investigated genetic associations that may predict response to mepolizumab-treatment.	
29107063	Hidden heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from genetic association studies and other analyses.	Despite evident success in clarifying many important features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the efficient methods of its prevention and treatment are not yet available. The reasons are likely to be the fact that AD is a multifactorial and heterogeneous health disorder with multiple alternative pathways of disease development and progression. The availability of genetic data on individuals participated in longitudinal studies of aging health and longevity, as well as on participants of cross-sectional case-control studies allow for investigating genetic and non-genetic connections with AD and to link the results of these analyses with research findings obtained in clinical, experimental, and molecular biological studies of this health disorder. The objective of this paper is to perform GWAS of AD in several study populations and investigate possible roles of detected genetic factors in developing AD hallmarks and in other health disorders. The data collected in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study (LOADFS) were used in these analyses. The logistic regression and Cox's regression were used as statistical models in GWAS. The results of analyses confirmed strong associations of genetic variants from well-known genes APOE, TOMM40, PVRL2 (NECTIN2), and APOC1 with AD. Possible roles of these genes in pathological mechanisms resulting in development of hallmarks of AD are described. Many genes whose connection with AD was detected in other studies showed nominally significant associations with this health disorder in our study. The evidence on genetic connections between AD and vulnerability to infection, as well as between AD and other health disorders, such as cancer and type 2 diabetes, were investigated. The progress in uncovering hidden heterogeneity in AD would be substantially facilitated if common mechanisms involved in development of AD, its hallmarks, and AD related chronic conditions were investigated in their mutual connection.	 24777546 24534555 21920438 25711031 16313259 15709483 24498013 18452970 16862161 18468826 15181252 19416677 24549102 25387057 19005175 28215174 22290178 28242298 27023435 22629316 20354705 19001172 22899188 24064264 26468143 26184725 19275633 26639962 28246336 15750215 24468470 26572157 18487850 27101831 23326517 25199842 22815194 27154058 22286219 20838585 16391793 26758603 26968700 20686565 21715678 2807709 26238946 24529521 28258088 27229721 24906231 22710912 17696193 20426618 22159054 28572047 19734902 21352095 23288655 28258087 28035936 23100439 23620513 28459000 24059324 26657933 26239352 16894402 26004017 23562540 25015123 25207746 24059323 28261941 27497484 23111699 21569558 24084292 24688116 27277824 26795201 27707806 25745640 20188211 28507517 21435176 21418511 24924924 26967229 25247594 12529167 26679859 28225789 21266538 28346566 23546992 27259692 25385258 25512792 22898894 24746514 26800892 21933454 27875990 23758976 21740922 28768149 15817610 26930295 24176626 19442637 26657631 21196064 8089103 28067607 21156047
29077507	Multiethnic Meta-Analysis Identifies RAI1 as a Possible Obstructive Sleep Apnea-related Quantitative Trait Locus in Men.	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common heritable disorder displaying marked sexual dimorphism in disease prevalence and progression. Previous genetic association studies have identified a few genetic loci associated with OSA and related quantitative traits, but they have only focused on single ethnic groups, and a large proportion of the heritability remains unexplained. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is a commonly used quantitative measure characterizing OSA severity. Because OSA differs by sex, and the pathophysiology of obstructive events differ in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, we hypothesized that additional genetic association signals would be identified by analyzing the NREM/REM-specific AHI and by conducting sex-specific analyses in multiethnic samples. We performed genome-wide association tests for up to 19,733 participants of African, Asian, European, and Hispanic/Latino American ancestry in 7 studies. We identified rs12936587 on chromosome 17 as a possible quantitative trait locus for NREM AHI in men (N = 6,737; P = 1.7 × 10	 22267724 25693563 20538960 25373911 16564214 22578325 25409106 23155414 9613860 22138821 8464434 24013639 24037378 27699167 22064851 11282771 10673173 18812455 22056827 24132995 17357070 25481384 15781100 26426971 22955616 14607346 17666524 19014073 12911743 17167088 20616382 23754948 7881656 16444292 24897551 10615134 23202125 26977737 20502693 18974833 18285828 12668679 20625114 18209735 8725788 26112012 25673412 20663924 21739587 24392863 16647992 27836648 19543373 22706312 18231123 25954001 25781356
29082582	Problematic alcohol use associates with sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) in trauma-exposed populations.	Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort.

29084231	Common, low-frequency, and rare genetic variants associated with lipoprotein subclasses and triglyceride measures in Finnish men from the METSIM study.	Lipid and lipoprotein subclasses are associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, yet the genetic contributions to variability in subclass traits are not fully understood. We conducted single-variant and gene-based association tests between 15.1M variants from genome-wide and exome array and imputed genotypes and 72 lipid and lipoprotein traits in 8,372 Finns. After accounting for 885 variants at 157 previously identified lipid loci, we identified five novel signals near established loci at HIF3A, ADAMTS3, PLTP, LCAT, and LIPG. Four of the signals were identified with a low-frequency (0.005<minor allele frequency [MAF]<0.05) or rare (MAF<0.005) variant, including Arg123His in LCAT. Gene-based associations (P<10-10) support a role for coding variants in LIPC and LIPG with lipoprotein subclass traits. 30 established lipid-associated loci had a stronger association for a subclass trait than any conventional trait. These novel association signals provide further insight into the molecular basis of dyslipidemia and the etiology of metabolic disorders.	 22156577 23288948 18193044 22650159 22418572 3739751 23243195 24055740 25691689 12601178 26254015 27135400 27005778 25751400 19684899 20944595 19287092 12569161 20038528 24507774 21829380 23555291 25625282 25654695 22286219 20686565 1859405 22955616 9812910 19038363 19223598 26717317 27398621 28119442 25961943 15077113 24397894 21970364 24586121 12569160 22367708 10192396 21831376 21907014 26305978 25573147 19755485 23269371 25673412 24995866 24497850 24248942 19060906 24097068 23525445 20562413 16380547 11435404 26011824 20208533

Asthma, hay fever (or allergic rhinitis) and eczema (or atopic dermatitis) often coexist in the same individuals, partly because of a shared genetic origin. To identify shared risk variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS; n = 360,838) of a broad allergic disease phenotype that considers the presence of any one of these three diseases.

29066854	2SNP heritability and effects of genetic variants for neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio.	Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are important biomarkers for disease development and progression. To gain insight into the genetic causes of variance in NLR and PLR in the general population, we conducted genome-wide association (GWA) analyses and estimated SNP heritability in a sample of 5901 related healthy Dutch individuals. GWA analyses identified a new genome-wide significant locus on the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region for PLR, which replicated in a sample of 2538 British twins. For platelet count, we replicated three known genome-wide significant loci in our cohort (at CCDC71L-PIK3CG, BAK1 and ARHGEF3). For neutrophil count, we replicated the PSMD3 locus. For the identified top SNPs, we found significant cis and trans expression quantitative trait loci effects for several loci involved in hematological and immunological pathways. Linkage Disequilibrium score (LD) regression analyses for PLR and NLR confirmed that both traits are heritable, with a polygenetic SNP heritability for PLR of 14.1%, and for NLR of 2.4%. Genetic correlations were present between ratios and the constituent counts, with the genetic correlation (r=0.45) of PLR with platelet count reaching statistical significance. In conclusion, we established that two important biomarkers have a significant heritable SNP component, and identified the first genome-wide locus for PLR.	 24614105 11780939 21738478 25705162 25853885 16862161 18197199 24473328 26024889 25642630 25120783 17846035 28165122 26544803 26536980 24968121 23935956 18839276 24921916 21153663 22820512 20886046 22009189 21385855 23625199 26805783 22139419 20410504 23522328 21738480 18667698 18179887 23531865 20172861 26220525 26416715 24026423 23737753 23876227 26414676 22191716 19820697 19221038 19862010 26657649 21058334 24728292 21738479 27663502 17592125 20477721 20139978 17701901 27690543 23094636 25480500 23074066 23222517 26064965 18348202 23263863 24097068 21167468 25849990 16339693 19198610 25231743 24681815 20338884 22492648 19543373 22423221 25096241

29095316	Genome-wide association study for genetic variants related with maximal voluntary ventilation reveals two novel genomic signals associated with lung function.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for spirometry parameters have been limited to forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and their ratio. This study examined to identify genetic variants associated with maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), an important spirometry parameter presenting inspiratory muscle strength.A total of 8842 Korean subjects participated in the Korean Association REsource Consortium were used to identify nucleotide variants associated with MVV and other spirometry parameters through a GWAS. Genetic associations were determined by employing a mixed model that can control background polygenic effects.The analysis revealed 3 nucleotide variants associated with MVV (P < 5 × 10). One (rs1496255) was also associated with FVC and FEV1. The other 2 variants were identified only for MVV and located in the genes of LOC102724340 (rs41434646) and FHIT (rs9833533). In particular, FHIT represses transcriptional activity of β-catenin, a critical protein for growth of skeletal muscle, and thus might have influenced the level of MVV.The current study revealed 2 novel nucleotide variants as genetic association signals for MVV. The association signals were suggested specific for neuromuscular diseases with a restrictive ventilatory impairment. Further studies are required to understand underlying mechanisms for their influence to restrictive lung diseases.	 23932459 7200340 16436469 23376423 21288905 648206 21892150 26634245 26635082 21946350 6606385 18596417 23299959 20010834 18077326 21119205 16264058 16055882 22231545 10861898 7331181 7103242 26630577 12796194 21324671 16267090 24673696 7444828 25002401 21167468 20010835 19396169 25640449 15023009 19300500 19695101 8047713

This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with uncontrolled BP on combination therapy with a thiazide diuretic and a β-blocker.	 26084263 26432245 16862161 11712771 21986251 21208655 22064851 28222112 19249413 19609347 26201974 11592949 25511213 25622599 24288524 22820512 26592190 14657064 27502908 25472959 25385345 24714214 17531579 20375987 27490782 26462805 17137217 26149738 17700361 28070240 27447665 28495658 27323773 24560520 20233392 19845074 9809930 23125214 23144044 21451595 23761671 21058334 26425837 25338720 24309125 24352797 25359234 20634204 17701901 25064769 23907142 16154016 15477383 25134739 25853135 25031298 23873354 26194979 25767282 25587205 25954001 19052124
29093273	Genetic determinants of circulating GIP and GLP-1 concentrations.	The secretion of insulin and glucagon from the pancreas and the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) from the gastrointestinal tract is essential for glucose homeostasis. Several novel treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) mimic GLP-1 actions or inhibit incretin degradation (DPP4 inhibitors), but none is thus far aimed at increasing the secretion of endogenous incretins. In order to identify new potential therapeutic targets for treatment of T2D, we performed a meta-analysis of a GWAS and an exome-wide association study of circulating insulin, glucagon, GIP, and GLP-1 concentrations measured during an oral glucose tolerance test in up to 7,828 individuals. We identified 6 genome-wide significant functional loci associated with plasma incretin concentrations in or near the SLC5A1 (encoding SGLT1), GIPR, ABO, GLP2R, F13A1, and HOXD1 genes and studied the effect of these variants on mRNA expression in pancreatic islet and on metabolic phenotypes. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of GIPR, ABO, and HOXD1 in human enteroendocrine cells and expression of ABO in pancreatic islets, supporting a role in hormone secretion. This study thus provides candidate genes and insight into mechanisms by which secretion and breakdown of GIP and GLP-1 are regulated.	 18974171 22272906 23707316 25767259 20529992 15544847 27048234 17676310 22124465 21501586 19729612 22325160 20305008 17498508 23990519 26699465 11916347 20935630 20354512 19251046 21593115 20454776 24412928 25631608 22791750 25304002 25746169 19734900 22581228 17293876 25157092 25894829 12537595 23569246 20509871 22843986 28530675 17701901 6174334 25774817 21810601 25748021 21167468 24891433 1520322 23349498 15797829 26672094 20081857 20167578 22349073 23633510 26395740 20081858 26344355 10982769 25954001

29097723	Genome-wide linkage and association study implicates the 10q26 region as a major genetic contributor to primary nonsyndromic vesicoureteric reflux.	Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the commonest urological anomaly in children. Despite treatment improvements, associated renal lesions - congenital dysplasia, acquired scarring or both - are a common cause of childhood hypertension and renal failure. Primary VUR is familial, with transmission rate and sibling risk both approaching 50%, and appears highly genetically heterogeneous. It is often associated with other developmental anomalies of the urinary tract, emphasising its etiology as a disorder of urogenital tract development. We conducted a genome-wide linkage and association study in three European populations to search for loci predisposing to VUR. Family-based association analysis of 1098 parent-affected-child trios and case/control association analysis of 1147 cases and 3789 controls did not reveal any compelling associations, but parametric linkage analysis of 460 families (1062 affected individuals) under a dominant model identified a single region, on 10q26, that showed strong linkage (HLOD = 4.90; ZLRLOD = 4.39) to VUR. The ~9Mb region contains 69 genes, including some good biological candidates. Resequencing this region in selected individuals did not clearly implicate any gene but FOXI2, FANK1 and GLRX3 remain candidates for further investigation. This, the largest genetic study of VUR to date, highlights the 10q26 region as a major genetic contributor to VUR in European populations.	 27548312 22507743 11315092 21833088 23664119 21652655 12394743 26367797 20303521 23128226 14501657 16442091 23684010 23409123 18670373 21892150 27571263 11115062 24681721 21765025 11713418 28282036 25431634 20644199 22517427 27152526 23664116 23291585 24733292 15829711 8447318 20354512 17895932 21441121 9345087 1580681 19443636 19959718 9284209 22577215 10742323 17660461 21478889 27694958 11731797 16715099 25033443 23620400 17554300 22751902 18287559 20634204 17701901 20007758 19561590 3975102 7581446 15888565 18197425 19451168 10739767 23499752 1433599 11343739 18322164 9146654 1433624 11009294 17012268 11788961 19690587 24498626 16565260 20208533
29112194	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel locus for cannabis dependence.	Despite moderate heritability, only one study has identified genome-wide significant loci for cannabis-related phenotypes. We conducted meta-analyses of genome-wide association study data on 2080 cannabis-dependent cases and 6435 cannabis-exposed controls of European descent. A cluster of correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a novel region on chromosome 10 was genome-wide significant (lowest P=1.3E-8). Among the SNPs, rs1409568 showed enrichment for H3K4me1 and H3K427ac marks, suggesting its role as an enhancer in addiction-relevant brain regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the angular and cingulate gyri. This SNP is also predicted to modify binding scores for several transcription factors. We found modest evidence for replication for rs1409568 in an independent cohort of African American (896 cases and 1591 controls; P=0.03) but not European American (EA; 781 cases and 1905 controls) participants. The combined meta-analysis (3757 cases and 9931 controls) indicated trend-level significance for rs1409568 (P=2.85E-7). No genome-wide significant loci emerged for cannabis dependence criterion count (n=8050). There was also evidence that the minor allele of rs1409568 was associated with a 2.1% increase in right hippocampal volume in an independent sample of 430 EA college students (fwe-P=0.008). The identification and characterization of genome-wide significant loci for cannabis dependence is among the first steps toward understanding the biological contributions to the etiology of this psychiatric disorder, which appears to be rising in some developed nations.	 11871371 20418890 26122584 26283092 25987507 26044905 20485568 24315570 25439723 25607358 25473424 21529783 27668389 23390554 25885710 23089632 11163266 12880848 20201924 16683055 21106759 24832863 26502112 26811803 24204649 22011681 20616382 26308883 22955987 22823124 19200528 19456333 19710631 11860390 21668797 23715323 17436240 26139635 26414678 11859196 1742275 20202923 21058334 24741043 22127213 24166409 27221226 22955989 20634204 19541620 11771995 26239289 17701901 24743097 17924335 20040588 27028160 15943940 22955828 27023175 20402985 19543373 20590400 10506833
29118346	Genome-wide Association Study of Idiopathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head.	Idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (IONFH) is an ischemic disorder that causes bone necrosis of the femoral head, resulting in hip joint dysfunction. IONFH is a polygenic disease and steroid and alcohol have already known to increase its risk; however, the mechanism of IONFH remains to be elucidated. We performed a genome-wide association study using ~60,000 subjects and found two novel loci on chromosome 20q12 and 12q24. Big data analyses identified LINC01370 as a candidate susceptibility gene in the 20q12 locus. Stratified analysis by IONFH risk factors suggested that the 12q24 locus was associated with IONFH through drinking capacity. Our findings would shed new light on pathophysiology of IONFH.	 26660727 21372407 19640674 26384821 2562960 26343334 17982410 7890797 19763724 22955988 24097066 23450014 26521779 22138821 26130054 15205891 15252296 24277619 17974890 17698375 2076924 23856555 22291604 509830 25707511 19715440 22820512 7979587 22495300 25723102 25722852 20224959 21953089 11741095 12915519 26590194 23243507 12771833 15084905 3409564 20811451 20358330 26363020 17962936 26484571 24296535 15930420 18991344 21645143 3225489 20634204 1574093 18696186 20074509 15934439 26265699 20981092 12355139 11792583 26387635 20714348 11709458 19004033 8465804
29123153	A genome-wide association study links small-vessel ischemic stroke to autophagy.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can serve as strong evidence in correlating biological pathways with human diseases. Although ischemic stroke has been found to be associated with many biological pathways, the genetic mechanism of ischemic stroke is still unclear. Here, we performed GWAS for a major subtype of stroke-small-vessel occlusion (SVO)-to identify potential genetic factors contributing to ischemic stroke. GWAS were conducted on 342 individuals with SVO stroke and 1,731 controls from a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan. The study was replicated in an independent Han Chinese population comprising an additional 188 SVO stroke cases and 1,265 controls.

29147026	Leveraging genome characteristics to improve gene discovery for putamen subcortical brain structure.	Discovering genetic variants associated with human brain structures is an on-going effort. The ENIGMA consortium conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with standard multi-study analytical methodology and identified several significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here we employ a novel analytical approach that incorporates functional genome annotations (e.g., exon or 5'UTR), total linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores and heterozygosity to construct enrichment scores for improved identification of relevant SNPs. The method provides increased power to detect associated SNPs by estimating stratum-specific false discovery rate (FDR), where strata are classified according to enrichment scores. Applying this approach to the GWAS summary statistics of putamen volume in the ENIGMA cohort, a total of 15 independent significant SNPs were identified (conditional FDR < 0.05). In contrast, 4 SNPs were found based on standard GWAS analysis (P < 5 × 10	 24319118 19474294 18353808 21320248 29136250 24473328 12946879 1478642 26189703 10471385 25904081 25064009 12946880 23637625 21552263 22856370 20583285 25439723 16566899 25607358 27338279 21556132 24316577 16800000 23418889 22820512 11453658 23375658 19763151 22689754 22955616 19249274 25282103 23770413 20616382 24702953 23644463 19065146 8725965 26808560 26555806 23033978 27629089 24711653 11731797 26414678 16500937 21058334 25862742 18574483 25224261 19812666 8278047 17670959 19786105 21839162 23637621 22243964 10923985 20360716 22889923 24844982 24095129 19571811 22055184 20208533

Male pattern baldness (MPB) or androgenetic alopecia is one of the most common conditions affecting men, reaching a prevalence of ~50% by the age of 50; however, the known genes explain little of the heritability. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study including more than 70,000 men, identifying 71 independently replicated loci, of which 30 are novel. These loci explain 38% of the risk, suggesting that MPB is less genetically complex than other complex traits. We show that many of these loci contain genes that are relevant to the pathology and highlight pathways and functions underlying baldness. Finally, despite only showing genome-wide genetic correlation with height, pathway-specific genetic correlations are significant for traits including lifespan and cancer. Our study not only greatly increases the number of MPB loci, illuminating the genetic architecture, but also provides a new approach to disentangling the shared biological pathways underlying complex diseases.	 22810306 27428752 1188424 23128226 22693459 26508577 25597830 26531824 26757425 2646917 25352553 21998597 19424496 14675213 15902657 25282103 18208984 20616382 21376301 20517342 27060448 26414676 18849994 21829388 20233392 27182965 25150481 27663502 11371349 28196072 25826379 28272467 16307704 27606777 24008273 22426310 2215561 19571811 23358095 26450413 18385763 26764224 26974007 26657631
29151059	Genome-wide association study of telomere length among South Asians identifies a second RTEL1 association signal.	Leucocyte telomere length (TL) is a potential biomarker of ageing and risk for age-related disease. Leucocyte TL is heritable and shows substantial differences by race/ethnicity. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) report ~10 loci harbouring SNPs associated with leucocyte TL, but these studies focus primarily on populations of European ancestry.	 23900074 27197291 15520935 18391173 20139977 21573004 24473328 16212831 27207662 12573379 25231748 22064851 16160703 25770094 27186324 20508208 24719895 26785477 16436506 26936823 24536095 23590571 27182778 26239175 25472675 25006006 23321625 20606151 23737753 26646793 21304559 18462274 12208997 24149546 18215413 19666704 22136229 23001564 16400618 22383894 7977349 25624462 26354067 23535734 20421499 21167468 27050034 24563217 26138067 12000852
29160300	Genome-wide association study identifies the common variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 responsible for variation in tacrolimus trough concentration in Caucasian kidney transplant recipients.	The immunosuppressant tacrolimus (TAC) is metabolized by both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 enzymes. It is common for European Americans (EA) to carry two CYP3A5 loss-of-function (LoF) variants that profoundly reduces TAC metabolism. Despite having two LoF alleles, there is still considerable variability in TAC troughs and identifying additional variants in genes outside of the CYP3A5 gene could provide insight into this variability. We analyzed TAC trough concentrations in 1345 adult EA recipients with two CYP3A5 LoF alleles in a genome-wide association study. Only CYP3A4*22 was identified and no additional variants were genome-wide significant. Additional high allele frequency genetic variants with strong genetic effects associated with TAC trough variability are unlikely to be associated with TAC variation in the EA population. These data suggest that low allele frequency variants, identified by DNA sequencing, should be evaluated and may identify additional variants that contribute to TAC pharmacokinetic variability.	 26227094 23879408 11740341 15169924 21671989 26325438 12065767 22384356 26681736 24249597 26829596 25588704 22947444 24061445 26423053 26485092 24658827 16501005 23175667 27597269 9636551 21085059 25287072 11279519 26228923 21107304 15951320 28704257 26067485 25271728 17701901 26667830 17965516 24094745 24739669 21206424 25590378 25817604 16430309 22909204 26879833 21903774
29160301	New insights into the pharmacogenomics of antidepressant response from the GENDEP and STAR*D studies: rare variant analysis and high-density imputation.	Genome-wide association studies have generally failed to identify polymorphisms associated with antidepressant response. Possible reasons include limited coverage of genetic variants that this study tried to address by exome genotyping and dense imputation. A meta-analysis of Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) and Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) studies was performed at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene and pathway levels. Coverage of genetic variants was increased compared with previous studies by adding exome genotypes to previously available genome-wide data and using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel for imputation. Standard quality control was applied. Phenotypes were symptom improvement and remission after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Significant findings were investigated in NEWMEDS consortium samples and Pharmacogenomic Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS) for replication. A total of 7062 950 SNPs were analyzed in GENDEP (n=738) and STAR*D (n=1409). rs116692768 (P=1.80e-08, ITGA9 (integrin α9)) and rs76191705 (P=2.59e-08, NRXN3 (neurexin 3)) were significantly associated with symptom improvement during citalopram/escitalopram treatment. At the gene level, no consistent effect was found. At the pathway level, the Gene Ontology (GO) terms GO: 0005694 (chromosome) and GO: 0044427 (chromosomal part) were associated with improvement (corrected P=0.007 and 0.045, respectively). The association between rs116692768 and symptom improvement was replicated in PGRN-AMPS (P=0.047), whereas rs76191705 was not. The two SNPs did not replicate in NEWMEDS. ITGA9 codes for a membrane receptor for neurotrophins and NRXN3 is a transmembrane neuronal adhesion receptor involved in synaptic differentiation. Despite their meaningful biological rationale for being involved in antidepressant effect, replication was partial. Further studies may help in clarifying their role.	 27548312 6080235 26173456 17194218 20351716 20051569 16862161 21085122 23091423 18190676 26911380 26012578 23726668 15834813 16633950 16959794 15061154 23554486 27001122 19255581 1929776 27622933 11987478 25885710 19160447 18300295 21255436 24281779 14665791 20943906 19880458 25043320 23377640 24256404 19846067 16415888 16230481 23842577 24743713 23852853 13688369 26149738 17007486 26035185 25485773 26013316 16677226 444788 23064114 12730696 25838241 23237317 19736353 21058334 7811843 21084300 22907730 19568273 25293720 14971628 20360315 26297903 22256872 17701901 19760522 23149449 25943212 20399565 25850031 24866044 22028362 24593825 25602163 25897834 15448691 21934132 18498636 23732877

29299148	Cancer risk susceptibility loci in a Swedish population.	A germline mutation in cancer predisposing genes is known to increase the risk of more than one tumor type. In order to find loci associated with many types of cancer, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted, and 3,555 Swedish cancer cases and 15,581 controls were analyzed for 226,883 SNPs. The study used haplotype analysis instead of single SNP analysis in order to find putative founder effects. Haplotype association studies identified seven risk loci associated with cancer risk, on chromosomes 1, 7, 11, 14, 16, 17 and 21. Four of the haplotypes, on chromosomes 7, 14, 16 and 17, were confirmed in Swedish familial cancer cases. It was possible to perform exome sequencing in one patient for each of those four loci. No clear disease-causing exonic mutation was found in any of the four loci. Some of the candidate loci hold several cancer genes, suggesting that the risk associated with one locus could involve more than one gene associated with cancer risk. In summary, this study identified seven novel candidate loci associated with cancer risk. It was also suggested that cancer risk at one locus could depend on multiple contributing risk mutations/genes.	 18709484 24706189 21351276 20371680 23137839 22033325 27135401 14968116 28068625 23128226 25789021 20852632 22807578 26956055 10433620 27747588 21623387 8261515 1651174 17468294 10891514 11125122 20596663 28289712 16966434 24336635 22237439 21544814 14612926 7545954 23327602 26468391 15630470 10389937 19583808 12354477 28373448 20204290 19207009 24761864 27432226 21478889 25391265 8091231 26220827 11377649 25583674 23884440 18541045 17004108 24942859 17701901 26818094 27145271 27502484 28262839 26617870 23535729 27771229 26763429 8145827 20601685 26657901 17465217 7907678

29186428	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel determinants of circulating serum progranulin.	Progranulin is a secreted protein with important functions in processes including immune and inflammatory response, metabolism and embryonic development. The present study aimed at identification of genetic factors determining progranulin concentrations. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis for serum progranulin in three independent cohorts from Europe: Sorbs (N = 848) and KORA (N = 1628) from Germany and PPP-Botnia (N = 335) from Finland (total N = 2811). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with progranulin levels were replicated in two additional German cohorts: LIFE-Heart Study (Leipzig; N = 967) and Metabolic Syndrome Berlin Potsdam (Berlin cohort; N = 833). We measured mRNA expression of genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by micro-arrays and performed mRNA expression quantitative trait and expression-progranulin association studies to functionally substantiate identified loci. Finally, we conducted siRNA silencing experiments in vitro to validate potential candidate genes within the associated loci. Heritability of circulating progranulin levels was estimated at 31.8% and 26.1% in the Sorbs and LIFE-Heart cohort, respectively. SNPs at three loci reached study-wide significance (rs660240 in CELSR2-PSRC1-MYBPHL-SORT1, rs4747197 in CDH23-PSAP and rs5848 in GRN) explaining 19.4%/15.0% of the variance and 61%/57% of total heritability in the Sorbs/LIFE-Heart Study. The strongest evidence for association was at rs660240 (P = 5.75 × 10-50), which was also associated with mRNA expression of PSRC1 in PBMC (P = 1.51 × 10-21). Psrc1 knockdown in murine preadipocytes led to a consecutive 30% reduction in progranulin secretion. In conclusion, the present meta-GWAS combined with mRNA expression identified three loci associated with progranulin and supports the role of PSRC1 in the regulation of progranulin secretion.

29186694	Large-Scale Cognitive GWAS Meta-Analysis Reveals Tissue-Specific Neural Expression and Potential Nootropic Drug Targets.	Here, we present a large (n = 107,207) genome-wide association study (GWAS) of general cognitive ability ("g"), further enhanced by combining results with a large-scale GWAS of educational attainment. We identified 70 independent genomic loci associated with general cognitive ability. Results showed significant enrichment for genes causing Mendelian disorders with an intellectual disability phenotype. Competitive pathway analysis implicated the biological processes of neurogenesis and synaptic regulation, as well as the gene targets of two pharmacologic agents: cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and LY97241, a potassium channel inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide and epigenome-wide analysis revealed that the implicated loci were enriched for genes expressed across all brain regions (most strongly in the cerebellum). Enrichment was exclusive to genes expressed in neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Finally, we report genetic correlations between cognitive ability and disparate phenotypes including psychiatric disorders, several autoimmune disorders, longevity, and maternal age at first birth.	 27548312 25644384 26432245 25174004 18391951 24183029 25948564 27268795 22251222 25056061 25642630 25539791 20829693 28746715 25550326 28402318 25885710 21841781 23358156 27707967 15386596 21451499 26809841 23027411 28530673 20616382 25201988 28385461 26414676 26178667 18171944 27225129 27321640 22642228 21826061 27312344 28057866 23722424 24342994 27663502 24762786 19294424 20010807 28552197 26503795 18391952 28397838 25813877 27251486 28963561 20679521 25673413 27694570 23926272 26121088 20819015 23325106 27694991 25224258 23868113 25869805 28093568 27046643
29423119	Meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies identifies two loci that predict survival and treatment outcome in breast cancer.	The majority of breast cancers are driven by the female hormone oestrogen via oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha. ER-positive patients are commonly treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy, however, resistance is a common occurrence and aside from ER-status, no unequivocal predictive biomarkers are currently in clinical use. In this study, we aimed to identify constitutional genetic variants influencing breast cancer survival among ER-positive patients and specifically, among endocrine-treated patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies comprising in total 3,136 patients with ER-positive breast cancer of which 2,751 had received adjuvant endocrine therapy. We identified a novel locus (rs992531 at 8p21.2) associated with reduced survival among the patients with ER-positive breast cancer (	 10334533 20709693 22064851 19221464 25823661 22180457 22955616 9039267 25964295 25157146 25890600 19937980 18835386 23644459 17517369 25431329 21801820 26030518 22522925 22452336 24440914 18240019 25526632 23176488 20887199 16112269 20577206 20020197
29187730	Genome-wide analysis in UK Biobank identifies four loci associated with mood instability and genetic correlation with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and schizophrenia.	Mood instability is a core clinical feature of affective and psychotic disorders. In keeping with the Research Domain Criteria approach, it may be a useful construct for identifying biology that cuts across psychiatric categories. We aimed to investigate the biological validity of a simple measure of mood instability and evaluate its genetic relationship with several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mood instability in 53,525 cases and 60,443 controls from UK Biobank, identifying four independently associated loci (on chromosomes 8, 9, 14 and 18), and a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimate of ~8%. We found a strong genetic correlation between mood instability and MDD (r 	 26615365 25662294 20836910 21788082 18673409 21653843 27890972 28439101 22384356 24074230 21926972 11329059 27833568 28250456 25056061 25642630 28250454 23672542 24687194 23062775 26754954 24346136 26243040 19180491 27067015 24885632 26414676 24190934 19615671 22472876 7478581 12091877 20732625 22228176 25826379 17701901 23269371 17003333 26368830 26429679 24282498 23835198 28267147 23331090 26265397 20016818 12393422
29187748	Genome-wide association study of subcortical brain volume in PTSD cases and trauma-exposed controls.	Depending on the traumatic event, a significant fraction of trauma survivors subsequently develop PTSD. The additional variability in PTSD risk is expected to arise from genetic susceptibility. Unfortunately, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have failed to identify a consistent genetic marker for PTSD. The heritability of intermediate phenotypes such as regional brain volumes is often 80% or higher. We conducted a GWAS of subcortical brain volumes in a sample of recent military veteran trauma survivors (n = 157), grouped into PTSD (n = 66) and non-PTSD controls (n = 91). Covariates included PTSD diagnosis, sex, intracranial volume, ancestry, childhood trauma, SNP×PTSD diagnosis, and SNP×childhood trauma.

29187746	Genome-wide haplotype-based association analysis of major depressive disorder in Generation Scotland and UK Biobank.	Genome-wide association studies using genotype data have had limited success in the identification of variants associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Haplotype data provide an alternative method for detecting associations between variants in weak linkage disequilibrium with genotyped variants and a given trait of interest. A genome-wide haplotype association study for MDD was undertaken utilising a family-based population cohort, Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (n = 18,773), as a discovery cohort with UK Biobank used as a population-based replication cohort (n = 25,035). Fine mapping of haplotype boundaries was used to account for overlapping haplotypes potentially tagging the same causal variant. Within the discovery cohort, two haplotypes exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10	 17681762 20663410 1655852 19100699 23653854 24473328 20562875 19416750 25642630 17943122 12499305 17360153 20872768 21621269 19065144 22786799 22911880 25914875 26544616 20953200 26176920 12742871 17964051 12772088 16316783 20616382 15241432 21117147 23737753 23535385 24553384 25201436 15108176 26598607 22472876 18499089 22520966 15706348 21791035 26297903 17701901 17768066 23269371 24743097 20382196 17052748 26571028 11007705 24739678 26048416 24282498 20562874 19818725 27479909 19067971 22832354

29195075	An Unexpectedly Complex Architecture for Skin Pigmentation in Africans.	Approximately 15 genes have been directly associated with skin pigmentation variation in humans, leading to its characterization as a relatively simple trait. However, by assembling a global survey of quantitative skin pigmentation phenotypes, we demonstrate that pigmentation is more complex than previously assumed, with genetic architecture varying by latitude. We investigate polygenicity in the KhoeSan populations indigenous to southern Africa who have considerably lighter skin than equatorial Africans. We demonstrate that skin pigmentation is highly heritable, but known pigmentation loci explain only a small fraction of the variance. Rather, baseline skin pigmentation is a complex, polygenic trait in the KhoeSan. Despite this, we identify canonical and non-canonical skin pigmentation loci, including near SLC24A5, TYRP1, SMARCA2/VLDLR, and SNX13, using a genome-wide association approach complemented by targeted resequencing. By considering diverse, under-studied African populations, we show how the architecture of skin pigmentation can vary across humans subject to different local evolutionary pressures.	 26748516 25102153 10689800 23771755 23823723 20221248 7258341 18083106 6508999 23110848 20562875 24681889 27268795 17952075 20595611 28366442 19425101 25963972 20445093 11775055 14204850 22064851 25439723 19340012 27216439 21383195 19407144 10766940 24068893 22556244 7199888 23555287 20644199 26080414 21890477 20083088 16357253 17182896 24058663 20164927 26744415 22748210 28301464 25383972 25282103 18488028 20616382 25722852 15386260 20647424 11126724 23737753 20811451 23910464 22997136 19784067 23118974 18971310 19297406 9545414 24385924 22923467 21050833 24267888 23586463 17924348 24550290 26712023 17236130 25008852 24743097 27474727 19451168 21167468 19374514 24616518 24244186 20926424 22917817 24679998 19543373 20208533

29251981	Hierarchical investigation of genetic influences on response inhibition in healthy young adults.	Poor inhibitory control is a known risk factor for substance use disorders, making it a priority to identify the determinants of these deficits. The aim of the current study was to identify genetic associations with inhibitory control using the stop signal task in a large sample (n = 934) of healthy young adults of European ancestry. We genotyped the subjects genome-wide and then used a hierarchical approach in which we tested seven a priori single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with stop signal task performance, approximately 9,000 SNPs designated as high-value addiction (HVA) markers by the SmokeScreen array, and approximately five million genotyped and imputed SNPs, followed by a gene-based association analysis using the resultant p values. A priori SNP analyses revealed nominally significant associations between response inhibition and one locus in HTR2A (rs6313; p = .04, dominance model, uncorrected) in the same direction as prior findings. A nominally significant association was also found in one locus in ANKK1 (rs1800497; p = .03, uncorrected), although in the opposite direction of previous reports. After accounting for multiple comparisons, the HVA, genome-wide, and gene-based analyses yielded no significant findings. This study implicates variation in serotonergic and dopaminergic genes while underscoring the difficulty of detecting the influence of individual SNPs, even when biological information is used to prioritize testing. Although such small effect sizes suggest limited utility of individual SNPs in predicting risk for addiction or other impulse control disorders, they may nonetheless shed light on complex biological processes underlying poor inhibitory control.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major comorbidity among HIV-infected individuals. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cCIMT) is a valid and reliable subclinical measure of atherosclerosis and is known to predict CVD. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) and admixture analysis among 682 HIV-positive and 288 HIV-negative Black, non-Hispanic women from the Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS) cohort using a combined and stratified analysis approach. We found some suggestive associations but none of the SNPs reached genome-wide statistical significance in our GWAS analysis. The top GWAS SNPs were rs2280828 in the region intergenic to mediator complex subunit 30 and exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (MED30 | EXT1) among all women, rs2907092 in the catenin delta 2 (CTNND2) gene among HIV-positive women, and rs7529733 in the region intergenic to family with sequence similarity 5, member C and regulator of G-protein signaling 18 (FAM5C | RGS18) genes among HIV-negative women. The most significant local European ancestry associations were in the region intergenic to the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 5D gene and NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 1 (ZSCAN5D | NDUF1) pseudogene on chromosome 19 among all women, in the region intergenic to vomeronasal 1 receptor 6 pseudogene and zinc finger protein 845 (VN1R6P | ZNF845) gene on chromosome 19 among HIV-positive women, and in the region intergenic to the SEC23-interacting protein and phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 1A (SEC23IP | PPAPDC1A) genes located on chromosome 10 among HIV-negative women. A number of previously identified SNP associations with cCIMT were also observed and included rs2572204 in the ryanodine receptor 3 (RYR3) and an admixture region in the secretion-regulating guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SERGEF) gene. We report several SNPs and gene regions in the GWAS and admixture analysis, some of which are common across HIV-positive and HIV-negative women as demonstrated using meta-analysis, and also across the two analytic approaches (i.e., GWA and admixture). These findings suggest that local European ancestry plays an important role in genetic associations of cCIMT among black women from WIHS along with other environmental factors that are related to CVD and may also be triggered by HIV. These findings warrant confirmation in independent samples.	 25468659 22495753 21347282 11730394 22951632 11315092 17003363 27872105 22627881 20930713 25100719 16862161 24658877 19455012 12124407 20009918 24951662 23487405 18787196 20671544 23153620 17369504 22563364 19537956 25902833 23793823 23194035 18192217 20048286 16148165 19193380 15692111 20798374 25519335 9056629 11137099 22234696 25902421 20594047 23275298 17903303 16227796 24265418 15088270 22580566 25043967 17275008 20961976 20400883 17456578 15023877 16697654 21909108 21666250 9620772 15256397 23196938 17242284 17761941 14681465 22717648 21858044 28408707 18670221 18430236 16640957 24751643 25251368 24561552 20409867 17701901 20889494 17604107 22216000 23615000 22460597 27827325 28396569 23449258 22423143 21541012 7521166 19372452 9504278 19344451 26744416

29210060	Genome-wide association study identifies the GLDC/IL33 locus associated with survival of osteosarcoma patients.	Survival rates for osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone cancer, have changed little over the past three decades and are particularly low for patients with metastatic disease. We conducted a multi-institutional genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify germline genetic variants associated with overall survival in 632 patients with osteosarcoma, including 523 patients of European ancestry and 109 from Brazil. We conducted a time-to-event analysis and estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards models, with and without adjustment for metastatic disease. The results were combined across the European and Brazilian case sets using a random-effects meta-analysis. The strongest association after meta-analysis was for rs3765555 at 9p24.1, which was inversely associated with overall survival (HR = 1.76; 95% CI 1.41-2.18, p = 4.84 × 10	 19525685 19474294 25174004 10835412 25897948 22232737 23666239 19454435 19197972 22064851 19684604 28338660 27352631 26002013 23555554 26084801 28402273 22648705 27287205 26912475 12859030 25823661 19330840 21124317 22955616 26095223 25611573 12958120 26560027 22327514 20308648 21372215 12879476 17921068 25890600 20939024 22983152 22955989 20634204 24345772 20876667 27241064 23180869 19232880 16919776 20981092 22225612 25620841 23727862 25030440 23724904 23205532 22941191 23688189 25954001 19349163 15659502
29213071	GWAS of the electrocardiographic QT interval in Hispanics/Latinos generalizes previously identified loci and identifies population-specific signals.	QT interval prolongation is a heritable risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and can predispose to sudden death. Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of QT were performed in European ancestral populations, leaving other groups uncharacterized. Herein we present the first QT GWAS of Hispanic/Latinos using data on 15,997 participants from four studies. Study-specific summary results of the association between 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) imputed SNPs and electrocardiographically measured QT were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. We identified 41 genome-wide significant SNPs that mapped to 13 previously identified QT loci. Conditional analyses distinguished six secondary signals at NOS1AP (n = 2), ATP1B1 (n = 2), SCN5A (n = 1), and KCNQ1 (n = 1). Comparison of linkage disequilibrium patterns between the 13 lead SNPs and six secondary signals with previously reported index SNPs in 1000G super populations suggested that the SCN5A and KCNE1 lead SNPs were potentially novel and population-specific. Finally, of the 42 suggestively associated loci, AJAP1 was suggestively associated with QT in a prior East Asian GWAS; in contrast BVES and CAP2 murine knockouts caused cardiac conduction defects. Our results indicate that whereas the same loci influence QT across populations, population-specific variation exists, motivating future trans-ethnic and ancestrally diverse QT GWAS.	 20609343 17546500 1985358 23437344 21738491 24861553 23166209 13057814 22384356 23128226 21511878 23908377 21753830 19587794 23463857 22025428 16043757 11684624 19022967 7733014 14575938 27734877 10622302 10750623 26616005 17903306 20581827 12397006 20616382 27988371 15851319 25055868 24952745 20622880 20609344 19026856 27577874 15461007 16648850 22726844 22912591 21347284 15892024 20031603 14630600 21647700 27162171 17538054 28831689 24322550 23369741 20062063 23515882 28090672 25693562 19576304 15499007 19305408 26657631 28389980 24568819 23534349 26748518

29220522	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies 8 novel loci involved in shape variation of human head hair.	Shape variation of human head hair shows striking variation within and between human populations, while its genetic basis is far from being understood. We performed a series of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and replication studies in a total of 28 964 subjects from 9 cohorts from multiple geographic origins. A meta-analysis of three European GWASs identified 8 novel loci (1p36.23 ERRFI1/SLC45A1, 1p36.22 PEX14, 1p36.13 PADI3, 2p13.3 TGFA, 11p14.1 LGR4, 12q13.13 HOXC13, 17q21.2 KRTAP, and 20q13.33 PTK6), and confirmed 4 previously known ones (1q21.3 TCHH/TCHHL1/LCE3E, 2q35 WNT10A, 4q21.21 FRAS1, and 10p14 LINC00708/GATA3), all showing genome-wide significant association with hair shape (P < 5e-8). All except one (1p36.22 PEX14) were replicated with nominal significance in at least one of the 6 additional cohorts of European, Native American and East Asian origins. Three additional previously known genes (EDAR, OFCC1, and PRSS53) were confirmed at the nominal significance level. A multivariable regression model revealed that 14 SNPs from different genes significantly and independently contribute to hair shape variation, reaching a cross-validated AUC value of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62-0.70) and an AUC value of 0.64 in an independent validation cohort, providing an improved accuracy compared with a previous model. Prediction outcomes of 2504 individuals from a multiethnic sample were largely consistent with general knowledge on the global distribution of hair shape variation. Our study thus delivers target genes and DNA variants for future functional studies to further evaluate the molecular basis of hair shape in humans.	 29141579 17919196 26753140 22234890 24641098 25164149 19803779 23128226 26508577 27019510 135613 23819985 20585627 26959817 25716572 18065779 21572415 20644199 24258680 12573256 20881960 16091842 15845033 19589173 19505943 20080505 24528593 15797458 20616382 26414620 8477445 16007071 15982300 23554671 19896111 26733196 21569108 15366372 26432246 17919197 18651655 26926045 17701901 24743097 24646999 28087452 27866708 23358095 27559308 27487801 19543373 26967478 22706312 28370528 21331090 18252221 23063621 25254375

29221444	Genome-wide association study of coronary artery calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African Americans with type 2 diabetes.	Coronary artery calcified atherosclerotic plaque (CAC) predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite exposure to more severe conventional CVD risk factors, African Americans (AAs) are less likely to develop CAC, and when they do, have markedly lower levels than European Americans. Genetic factors likely contribute to the observed ethnic differences. To identify genes associated with CAC in AAs with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the Illumina 5 M chip in 691 African American-Diabetes Heart Study participants (AA-DHS), with replication in 205 Jackson Heart Study (JHS) participants with T2D.

29253144	Polymorphisms in the Wilms Tumor Gene Are Associated With Interindividual Variations in Rubella Virus-Specific Cellular Immunity After Measles-Mumps-Rubella II Vaccination.	Rubella vaccination induces widely variable immune responses in vaccine recipients. While rubella vaccination is effective at inducing immunity to rubella infection in most subjects, up to 5% of individuals do not achieve or maintain long-term protective immunity. To expand upon our previous work identifying genetic polymorphisms that are associated with these interindividual differences in humoral immunity to rubella virus, we performed a genome-wide association study in a large cohort of 1843 subjects to discover single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with rubella virus-specific cellular immune responses. We identified SNPs in the Wilms tumor protein gene (WT1) that were significantly associated (P < 5 × 10-8) with interindividual variations in rubella-specific interleukin 6 secretion from subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells postvaccination. No SNPs were found to be significantly associated with variations in rubella-specific interferon-γ secretion. Our findings demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms in the WT1 gene in subjects of European ancestry are associated with interindividual differences in rubella virus-specific cellular immunity after measles-mumps-rubella II vaccination.	 12115544 22086389 26122450 25576992 22265947 26275479 10593950 26462627 9784496 19896518 766879 11595161 19200845 20001730 26655220 25293367 27417971 26090994 8621487 19659440 20217072 22241978 26854805 20647212 18419548 27417955 9223327 20974136 16912181 20237505 27993090 1655284 22610502 24375276 7738027 9499425 21875636 27417970 26563595 23269371 18348202 20117947 21939710 2154702 20079393 6126663 20562874 19761839 19543373 23579257 26807256 23936312
29240982	Multidimensional Bone Density Phenotyping Reveals New Insights Into Genetic Regulation of the Pediatric Skeleton.	Osteoporosis is a complex disease with developmental origins. It is therefore important to understand the genetic contribution to pediatric areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Individual skeletal site phenotyping has been primarily used to identify pediatric aBMD loci. However, this approach is limited because there is a degree of aBMD discordance across skeletal sites. We therefore applied a novel multidimensional phenotyping approach to further understand the genetic regulation of pediatric aBMD. Our sample comprised a prospective, longitudinal cohort of 1293 children of European ancestry (52% female; up to seven annual measurements). Principal components analysis was applied to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived aBMD Z-scores for total hip, femoral neck, spine, and distal radius to generate multidimensional aBMD phenotypes (ie, principal component scores). We tested the association between a genetic score (percentage of bone lowering alleles at 63 loci) and each principal component. We also performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) using the multiethnic baseline data (n = 1885) to identify novel loci associated with these principal components. The first component (PC1) reflected a concordant phenotypic model of the skeleton (eg, higher loading score = higher BMD across all sites). In contrast, PC2 was discordant for distal radius versus spine and hip aBMD, and PC3 was discordant for spine versus distal radius and hip aBMD. The genetic score was associated with PC1 (beta = -0.05, p = 3.9 × 10	
29253858	A family-based genome-wide association study of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps implicates several genes in the disease pathogenesis.	The pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is largely unknown. Previous studies have given valuable information about genetic variants associated with this disease but much is still unexplained. Our goal was to identify genetic markers and genes associated with susceptibility to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps using a family-based genome-wide association study.	 21991567 16890076 16564380 23664120 22391069 22941192 9699500 18922348 25677865 15647046 24395734 7408219 24013639 21303603 22424883 22173721 8876553 23028483 19184112 19405090 20625511 12903683 7538905 20666777 14977082 25282015 10480701 19793277 25756074 15577839 22271279 19080774 14609947 23193258 17701901 18622306 22513993 21629274 21167468 10718431 21293453 23540616 1527348 22416915 24691993 24133061 22764607 25975240 7581390 20358028 20208533

29273806	Multiancestry association study identifies new asthma risk loci that colocalize with immune-cell enhancer marks.	We examined common variation in asthma risk by conducting a meta-analysis of worldwide asthma genome-wide association studies (23,948 asthma cases, 118,538 controls) of individuals from ethnically diverse populations. We identified five new asthma loci, found two new associations at two known asthma loci, established asthma associations at two loci previously implicated in the comorbidity of asthma plus hay fever, and confirmed nine known loci. Investigation of pleiotropy showed large overlaps in genetic variants with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The enrichment in enhancer marks at asthma risk loci, especially in immune cells, suggested a major role of these loci in the regulation of immunologically related mechanisms.	 23829686 26211970 25693563 18923164 22941192 12111919 21814517 22561835 26374098 21374718 24013639 3802833 20860503 20032318 24316577 19715440 22617340 21946350 24952213 14646381 24406073 22694930 23209423 25582340 21505031 26422229 21989056 20502693 20110278 19557189 23087404 25707804 19426955 27863249 24241537 21682737 17991429 21804548 18729826 21907864 24388013 25591454 21804549 22426310 21442426 23345460 25954001 2252253

29278698	GWAS links variants in neuronal development and actin remodeling related loci with pseudoexfoliation syndrome without glaucoma.	Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEXS) is an age-related elastosis, strongly associated with the development of secondary glaucoma. It is clearly suggested that PEXS has a genetic component, but this has not been extensively studied. Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a DNA-pooling approach was conducted to explore the potential association of genetic variants with PEXS in a Polish population, including 103 PEXS patients without glaucoma and 106 perfectly (age- and gender-) matched controls. Individual sample TaqMan genotyping was used to validate GWAS-selected single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was applied to develop a prediction model for PEXS. In total, 15 SNPs representing independent PEXS susceptibility loci were selected for further validation in individual samples. For 14 of these variants, significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls were identified, of which 12 remained significant after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. The minor allele of five SNPs was associated with an increased risk of PEXS development, while for nine SNPs, it showed a protective effect. Beyond the known LOXL1 variant rs2165241, nine other SNPs were located within gene regions, including in OR11L1, CD80, TNIK, CADM2, SORBS2, RNF180, FGF14, FMN1, and RBFOX1 genes. None of these associations with PEXS has previously been reported. Selected SNPs were found to explain nearly 69% of the total risk of PEXS development. The overall risk prediction accuracy for PEXS, expressed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value, increased by 0.218, from 0.672 for LOXL1 rs2165241 alone to 0.89 when seven additional SNPs were included in the proposed 8-SNP prediction model. In conclusion, several new susceptibility loci for PEXS without glaucoma suggested that neuronal development and actin remodeling are potentially involved in either PEXS onset or inhibition or delay of its conversion to glaucoma.
