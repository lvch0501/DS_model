29263008	Investigating the genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy bodies: a two-stage genome-wide association study.	Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia in elderly people but has been overshadowed in the research field, partly because of similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. So far, to our knowledge, no large-scale genetic study of dementia with Lewy bodies has been done. To better understand the genetic basis of dementia with Lewy bodies, we have done a genome-wide association study with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors for this disorder.	 27548312 24842889 25188341 20562875 23407718 24973356 25064009 23150934 24013639 27571263 27287057 19026398 26252872 19416878 2026173 23921447 27871938 22892372 12754338 25722852 21376301 26643944 26836416 27312774 8105537 26401513 23588557 27535533 17681982 27694958 23334152 26818399 25362483 26595642 21738488 20509871 21737059 22863193 16237129 23622250 25954001 16267179

29364747	Rare and Common Variants Conferring Risk of Tooth Agenesis.	We present association results from a large genome-wide association study of tooth agenesis (TA) as well as selective TA, including 1,944 subjects with congenitally missing teeth, excluding third molars, and 338,554 controls, all of European ancestry. We also tested the association of previously identified risk variants, for timing of tooth eruption and orofacial clefts, with TA. We report associations between TA and 9 novel risk variants. Five of these variants associate with selective TA, including a variant conferring risk of orofacial clefts. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of tooth development and disease. The few variants previously associated with TA were uncovered through candidate gene studies guided by mouse knockouts. Knowing the etiology and clinical features of TA is important for planning oral rehabilitation that often involves an interdisciplinary approach.	 24355560 19165921 25883107 26854916 16434736 25807286 28123722 25642630 27033726 20195514 10742093 7958926 11035039 18787161 23760270 9371801 26082386 15151692 25092397 20616382 23704328 268264 28232668 23991204 17847007 24393477 27535533 24172245 21931568 11854422 24464100 24554542 9477034 1281468 6332449 25756904 26963285 26418927 25954001 25650440
29293537	Gene-level association analysis of systemic sclerosis: A comparison of African-Americans and White populations.	Gene-level analysis of ImmunoChip or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data has not been previously reported for systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma). The objective of this study was to analyze genetic susceptibility loci in SSc at the gene level and to determine if the detected associations were shared in African-American and White populations, using data from ImmunoChip and GWAS genotyping studies. The White sample included 1833 cases and 3466 controls (956 cases and 2741 controls from the US and 877 cases and 725 controls from Spain) and the African American sample, 291 cases and 260 controls. In both Whites and African Americans, we performed a gene-level analysis that integrates association statistics in a gene possibly harboring multiple SNPs with weak effect on disease risk, using Versatile Gene-based Association Study (VEGAS) software. The SNP-level analysis was performed using PLINK v.1.07. We identified 4 novel candidate genes (STAT1, FCGR2C, NIPSNAP3B, and SCT) significantly associated and 4 genes (SERBP1, PINX1, TMEM175 and EXOC2) suggestively associated with SSc in the gene level analysis in White patients. As an exploratory analysis we compared the results on Whites with those from African Americans. Of previously established susceptibility genes identified in Whites, only TNFAIP3 was significant at the nominal level (p = 6.13x10-3) in African Americans in the gene-level analysis of the ImmunoChip data. Among the top suggestive novel genes identified in Whites based on the ImmunoChip data, FCGR2C and PINX1 were only nominally significant in African Americans (p = 0.016 and p = 0.028, respectively), while among the top novel genes identified in the gene-level analysis in African Americans, UNC5C (p = 5.57x10-4) and CLEC16A (p = 0.0463) were also nominally significant in Whites. We also present the gene-level analysis of SSc clinical and autoantibody phenotypes among Whites. Our findings need to be validated by independent studies, particularly due to the limited sample size of African Americans.	 22076442 26474180 23239025 20807474 20570966 14594725 20383147 23793108 22614290 25328554 21790288 26212856 23740937 20598278 22727333 24387989 23756887 21779181 24401602 17701901 25887572 26032405 21750679 20124481 21167853 27111665 22896740
29309628	Genome-wide association study of offspring birth weight in 86 577 women identifies five novel loci and highlights maternal genetic effects that are independent of fetal genetics.	Genome-wide association studies of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics, whereas relatively little is known about the role of maternal genetic variation. We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth. We meta-analysed data on up to 8.7 million SNPs in up to 86 577 women of European descent from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the UK Biobank. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and analyses of mother-child pairs to quantify the separate maternal and fetal genetic effects. Maternal SNPs at 10 loci (MTNR1B, HMGA2, SH2B3, KCNAB1, L3MBTL3, GCK, EBF1, TCF7L2, ACTL9, CYP3A7) were associated with offspring birth weight at P < 5 × 10-8. In SEM analyses, at least 7 of the 10 associations were consistent with effects of the maternal genotype acting via the intrauterine environment, rather than via effects of shared alleles with the fetus. Variants, or correlated proxies, at many of the loci had been previously associated with adult traits, including fasting glucose (MTNR1B, GCK and TCF7L2) and sex hormone levels (CYP3A7), and one (EBF1) with gestational duration. The identified associations indicate that genetic effects on maternal glucose, cytochrome P450 activity and gestational duration, and potentially on maternal blood pressure and immune function, are relevant for fetal growth. Further characterization of these associations in mechanistic and causal analyses will enhance understanding of the potentially modifiable maternal determinants of fetal growth, with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with low and high birth weights.	 24768677 15737964 11315092 21935397 21833088 15985487 14948109 9662401 20372150 22504419 25281659 6538464 23258944 25642630 21324938 27680694 28877031 26192919 26964624 8307262 18311140 21909110 17572673 22493691 29447406 17326099 19430479 26603244 19060907 23088889 21124317 20581827 25282103 22139419 20616382 23704328 20682688 26621817 23202125 24553384 19633095 24816252 19430480 26014426 23720494 21931568 23903356 11279519 25642633 18463375 6541980 19896111 27182965 25060210 21058334 21885063 26284790 17186458 26978208 9187528 20477721 28017375 17701901 23202124 26482879 17503332 20558539 23222517 22426310 20714348 20453842 21909115 19198610 24853593 28135244 17215379 27063603 22233651 21533175 19060910 20081858 24262325 25954001 28072767 1954451 17311798 11940601
29304378	Life-Course Genome-wide Association Study Meta-analysis of Total Body BMD and Assessment of Age-Specific Effects.	Bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by DXA is used to evaluate bone health. In children, total body (TB) measurements are commonly used; in older individuals, BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) is used to diagnose osteoporosis. To date, genetic variants in more than 60 loci have been identified as associated with BMD. To investigate the genetic determinants of TB-BMD variation along the life course and test for age-specific effects, we performed a meta-analysis of 30 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of TB-BMD including 66,628 individuals overall and divided across five age strata, each spanning 15 years. We identified variants associated with TB-BMD at 80 loci, of which 36 have not been previously identified; overall, they explain approximately 10% of the TB-BMD variance when combining all age groups and influence the risk of fracture. Pathway and enrichment analysis of the association signals showed clustering within gene sets implicated in the regulation of cell growth and SMAD proteins, overexpressed in the musculoskeletal system, and enriched in enhancer and promoter regions. These findings reveal TB-BMD as a relevant trait for genetic studies of osteoporosis, enabling the identification of variants and pathways influencing different bone compartments. Only variants in ESR1 and close proximity to RANKL showed a clear effect dependency on age. This most likely indicates that the majority of genetic variants identified influence BMD early in life and that their effect can be captured throughout the life course.	 26733130 22733092 21789637 27311723 23437003 11719191 24163105 19933393 26744418 11162635 25534700 24068962 17158225 24430505 11585338 25597830 16670761 21623375 25642630 27626380 24954895 26323059 24606124 27845263 26392310 24249740 19224985 26218146 21757756 25589784 19356224 27535945 28477420 25260699 15523888 26214591 15781582 26414676 21625884 24194600 27476799 22792070 22045659 28344004 25047518 22504420 27345526 23074152 25814643 12074592 15760903 20024590 25900210 27663502 24762786 26367794 15940371 26235824 22426310 24114802 27107558 26032105 21533175 12568404 21423719 20809528 24945404 23810553
29290336	Genome-wide Study of Atrial Fibrillation Identifies Seven Risk Loci and Highlights Biological Pathways and Regulatory Elements Involved in Cardiac Development.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure, and premature death. The pathogenesis of AF remains poorly understood, which contributes to the current lack of highly effective treatments. To understand the genetic variation and biology underlying AF, we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 6,337 AF individuals and 61,607 AF-free individuals from Norway, including replication in an additional 30,679 AF individuals and 278,895 AF-free individuals. Through genotyping and dense imputation mapping from whole-genome sequencing, we tested almost nine million genetic variants across the genome and identified seven risk loci, including two novel loci.

29310926	Identification of non-HLA genes associated with development of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes in the prospective TEDDY cohort.	Traditional linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies have identified HLA and a number of non-HLA genes as genetic factors for islet autoimmunity (IA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the relative risk associated with previously identified non-HLA genes is usually very small as measured in cases/controls from mixed populations. Genetic associations for IA and T1D may be more accurately assessed in prospective cohorts. In this study, 5806 subjects from the TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) study, an international prospective cohort study, were genotyped for 176,586 SNPs on the ImmunoChip. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to discover the SNPs associated with the risk for IA, T1D, or both. Three regions were associated with the risk of developing any persistent confirmed islet autoantibody: one known region near SH2B3 (HR = 1.35, p = 3.58 × 10	 28077579 22284131 20444913 25075402 21564455 23522783 20829310 28646072 19017950 21515266 27670114 21383967 25422764 20453841 21340626 19768733 25660258 22517757 26248552 21193627 20833654 25003765 26405073 28941965 27015091 25422107 19281773 25802328 25640675 17850472 8660300 19481926 28081700 23740937 29018046 27690455 20574445 19430480 27723757 27481563 25362052 22476155 19956094 21980299 20871974 28568286 26513234 25620976 20634204 25803446 22777911 26074154 18373080 21205883 27812365 26347073 26450413 21266329 23444373

29317602	Genome-wide meta-analyses of stratified depression in Generation Scotland and UK Biobank.	Few replicable genetic associations for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been identified. Recent studies of MDD have identified common risk variants by using a broader phenotype definition in very large samples, or by reducing phenotypic and ancestral heterogeneity. We sought to ascertain whether it is more informative to maximize the sample size using data from all available cases and controls, or to use a sex or recurrent stratified subset of affected individuals. To test this, we compared heritability estimates, genetic correlation with other traits, variance explained by MDD polygenic score, and variants identified by genome-wide meta-analysis for broad and narrow MDD classifications in two large British cohorts - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank. Genome-wide meta-analysis of MDD in males yielded one genome-wide significant locus on 3p22.3, with three genes in this region (CRTAP, GLB1, and TMPPE) demonstrating a significant association in gene-based tests. Meta-analyzed MDD, recurrent MDD and female MDD yielded equivalent heritability estimates, showed no detectable difference in association with polygenic scores, and were each genetically correlated with six health-correlated traits (neuroticism, depressive symptoms, subjective well-being, MDD, a cross-disorder phenotype and Bipolar Disorder). Whilst stratified GWAS analysis revealed a genome-wide significant locus for male MDD, the lack of independent replication, and the consistent pattern of results in other MDD classifications suggests that phenotypic stratification using recurrence or sex in currently available sample sizes is currently weakly justified. Based upon existing studies and our findings, the strategy of maximizing sample sizes is likely to provide the greater gain.	 27548312 26122587 8775767 27270105 12813115 12102386 21926974 23933821 24473328 22384356 23042114 27838479 24507187 20562875 23128226 21926972 11989963 25597830 27932955 11722156 26836320 22138821 25642630 17014726 25550326 8656541 22786799 24316577 25885710 24413527 16899155 26176920 27871938 20616382 25722852 23749187 28196529 23737753 26414676 24553384 15337647 23427220 27519822 6544237 22472876 24721987 28270201 27663502 22955989 9333350 25826379 17701901 27899670 23290196 26368830 21167468 26048416 24282498 20926424 27479909 27089181
29324852	Real-life helping behaviours in North America: A genome-wide association approach.	In humans, prosocial behaviour is essential for social functioning. Twin studies suggest this distinct human trait to be partly hardwired. In the last decade research on the genetics of prosocial behaviour focused on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, such as oxytocin, dopamine, and their respective pathways. Recent trends towards large scale medical studies targeting the genetic basis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia pave the way for new directions also in behavioural genetics. Based on data from 10,713 participants of the American Health and Retirement Study we estimated heritability of helping behaviour-its total variance explained by 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms-to be 11%. Both, fixed models and mixed linear models identified rs11697300, an intergene variant on chromosome 20, as a candidate variant moderating this particular helping behaviour. We assume that this so far undescribed area is worth further investigation in association with human prosocial behaviour.	 26631737 15992526 17194218 19102585 21926974 24473328 20562875 15615684 23128226 22669648 23571845 22245314 12805551 27005778 11381111 25642630 18765804 26323059 19505497 20501604 17696996 18316737 11890840 19734902 17529973 17892333 16953685 15880108 26414676 20046877 19209222 14574401 18033244 24721987 27663502 19461999 17701901 21407268 21167468 21852800 22243964 19168625 5875340 15709940 18650375 8929413 20081858 15941488

29348612	GWAS in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals novel genetic associations at chromosomes 17q12 and 8q24.21.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (age 0-14 years) is 20% more common in Latino Americans than non-Latino whites. We conduct a genome-wide association study in a large sample of 3263 Californian children with ALL (including 1949 of Latino heritage) and 3506 controls matched on month and year of birth, sex, and ethnicity, and an additional 12,471 controls from the Kaiser Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging Cohort. Replication of the strongest genetic associations is performed in two independent datasets from the Children's Oncology Group and the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Here we identify new risk loci on 17q12 near IKZF3/ZPBP2/GSDMB/ORMDL3, a locus encompassing a transcription factor important for lymphocyte development (IKZF3), and at an 8q24 region known for structural contacts with the MYC oncogene. These new risk loci may impact gene expression via local (four 17q12 genes) or long-range (8q24) interactions, affecting function of well-characterized hematopoietic and growth-regulation pathways.	 26432245 25497547 27694927 25281659 24037378 22064851 22899827 26580448 19684604 21270240 17611496 28410997 28196749 26463672 25115512 20585100 19732864 26437776 20639880 12958120 20517342 23740937 20228799 18587394 22863734 23715323 19684603 27285583 23512250 25108383 27352912 22836110 17554300 28256501 22955989 24985129 20418889 17701901 23459081 20110276 18348202 26527286 20981092 27467250 22271045 23007406 23334668 26104880 24141364 19543373 21903159

29358691	Re-analysis of public genetic data reveals a rare X-chromosomal variant associated with type 2 diabetes.	The reanalysis of existing GWAS data represents a powerful and cost-effective opportunity to gain insights into the genetics of complex diseases. By reanalyzing publicly available type 2 diabetes (T2D) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for 70,127 subjects, we identify seven novel associated regions, five driven by common variants (LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO, and GIP genes), one by a low-frequency (EHMT2), and one driven by a rare variant in chromosome Xq23, rs146662057, associated with a twofold increased risk for T2D in males. rs146662057 is located within an active enhancer associated with the expression of Angiotensin II Receptor type 2 gene (AGTR2), a modulator of insulin sensitivity, and exhibits allelic specific activity in muscle cells. Beyond providing insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of T2D, these results also underscore the value of reanalyzing publicly available data using novel genetic resources and analytical approaches.	 17463246 25533388 25693563 24085035 21085122 23128226 25597830 10677506 25736587 25719930 25954002 11717395 25201977 28288115 16980380 24316577 23894285 15793237 21378176 21106759 2333095 24413736 26784234 27189021 20581827 26343387 26551672 23001124 20616382 23754948 27402621 24516404 27398621 25631608 25361004 19430480 22809536 17257271 24509480 3899691 20004761 22589738 23563607 22581228 21238885 15181163 17554300 27337301 24464100 25958046 25043022 24487276 26355827 21775993 21810601 23269371 23104008 24915262 26368830 17632545 22479202 21853325 20562413 24845081 20081857 25430897 19543373 21423719
29367611	Genome-wide association study of paclitaxel and carboplatin disposition in women with epithelial ovarian cancer.	Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence chemotherapy disposition may help to personalize cancer treatment and limit toxicity. Genome-wide approaches are unbiased, compared with candidate gene studies, but usually require large cohorts. As most chemotherapy is given cyclically multiple blood sampling is required to adequately define drug disposition, limiting patient recruitment. We found that carboplatin and paclitaxel disposition are stable phenotypes in ovarian cancer patients and tested a genome-wide association study (GWAS) design to identify SNPs associated with chemotherapy disposition. We found highly significant SNPs in ABCC2, a known carboplatin transporter, associated with carboplatin clearance (asymptotic P = 5.2 × 10	 19568750 18347095 15073098 12848775 16723972 16862161 27487151 10581368 17571346 24663127 23138311 8811211 22027652 21270794 12841818 9498685 12206135 12709333 22955616 18650507 20616382 16497925 16415888 19483685 9744776 7799018 17975154 9377473 25881102 1244564 17510208 23927520 10388081 8664192 16330681 21428769 17332740 20634204 19143748 12792751 12860964 17701901 2681557 20943283 19767092 17161157 12953086 26772957 21149285
29367735	A genome-wide association study in the Japanese population identifies the 12q24 locus for habitual coffee consumption: The J-MICC Study.	Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and its role in human health has received much attention. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have investigated genetic variants associated with coffee consumption in European populations, no such study has yet been conducted in an Asian population. Here, we conducted a GWAS to identify common genetic variations that affected coffee consumption in a Japanese population of 11,261 participants recruited as a part of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) study. Coffee consumption was collected using a self-administered questionnaire, and converted from categories to cups/day.

29379196	Genome-wide association study of Hirschsprung disease detects a novel low-frequency variant at the RET locus.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder with a population incidence of ~1/5000 live births, defined by an absence of enteric ganglia along variable lengths of the colon. HSCR genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found common associated variants at RET, SEMA3, and NRG1, but they still fail to explain all of its heritability. To enhance gene discovery, we performed a GWAS of 170 cases identified from the Danish nationwide pathology registry with 4717 controls, based on 6.2 million variants imputed from the haplotype reference consortium panel. We found a novel low-frequency variant (rs144432435), which, when conditioning on the lead RET single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), was of genome-wide significance in the discovery analysis. This conditional association signal was replicated in a Swedish HSCR cohort with discovery plus replication meta-analysis conditional odds ratio of 6.6 (P = 7.7 × 10	 27548312 17632694 26432245 17384015 24448550 25642630 11467640 21775357 22808122 17514199 21775345 25839327 2309705 26192919 15185108 24413527 19196962 25722852 23060615 11106284 21653522 26414676 25108383 27307146 18288195 19812666 20634204 25344690 23269371 3263991 15829955 21167468 23707863 25066220 24002048 20926424 26566484 19575812 17965226 27693352 26657631 27702942
29381699	Novel genetic polymorphisms associated with severe malaria and under selective pressure in North-eastern Tanzania.	Significant selection pressure has been exerted on the genomes of human populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection, resulting in the acquisition of mechanisms of resistance against severe malarial disease. Many host genetic factors, including sickle cell trait, have been associated with reduced risk of developing severe malaria, but do not account for all of the observed phenotypic variation. Identification of novel inherited risk factors relies upon high-resolution genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present findings of a GWAS of severe malaria performed in a Tanzanian population (n = 914, 15.2 million SNPs). Beyond the expected association with the sickle cell HbS variant, we identify protective associations within two interleukin receptors (IL-23R and IL-12RBR2) and the kelch-like protein KLHL3 (all P<10-6), as well as near significant effects for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes. Complementary analyses, based on detecting extended haplotype homozygosity, identified SYNJ2BP, GCLC and MHC as potential loci under recent positive selection. Through whole genome sequencing of an independent Tanzanian cohort (parent-child trios n = 247), we confirm the allele frequencies of common polymorphisms underlying associations and selection, as well as the presence of multiple structural variants that could be in linkage with these SNPs. Imputation of structural variants in a region encompassing the glycophorin genes on chromosome 4, led to the characterisation of more than 50 rare variants, and individually no strong evidence of associations with severe malaria in our primary dataset (P>0.3). Our approach demonstrates the potential of a joint genotyping-sequencing strategy to identify as-yet unknown susceptibility loci in an African population with well-characterised malaria phenotypes. The regions encompassing these loci are potential targets for the design of much needed interventions for preventing or treating malarial disease.	 27899115 19465909 26432245 23415221 22895189 25805752 23762245 20622879 26416757 28426727 20350312 22955616 19505943 22962449 16259530 25015648 26602091 16494531 25187124 20678249 9388224 28337387 23144702 23813607 1865923 17701901 22266938 28522690 25671784 26667835 9469942 26748515 23413192 28427357 17943131 20208533
29385134	Risk estimation model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the Japanese using multiple genetic markers.	The genetic factors affecting the natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NASH-derived hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC), are still unknown. In the current study, we sought to identify genetic factors related to the development of NAFLD, NASH, and NASH-HCC, and to establish risk-estimation models for them. For these purposes, 936 histologically proven NAFLD patients were recruited, and genome-wide association (GWA) studies were conducted for 902, including 476 NASH and 58 NASH-HCC patients, against 7,672 general-population controls. Risk estimations for NAFLD and NASH were then performed using the SNPs identified as having significant associations in the GWA studies. We found that rs2896019 in PNPLA3 [p = 2.3x10-31, OR (95%CI) = 1.85 (1.67-2.05)], rs1260326 in GCKR [p = 9.6x10-10, OR (95%CI) = 1.38(1.25-1.53)], and rs4808199 in GATAD2A [p = 2.3x10-8, OR (95%CI) = 1.37 (1.23-1.53)] were significantly associated with NAFLD. Notably, the number of risk alleles in PNPLA3 and GATAD2A was much higher in Matteoni type 4 (NASH) patients than in type 1, type 2, and type 3 NAFLD patients. In addition, we newly identified rs17007417 in DYSF [p = 5.2x10-7, OR (95%CI) = 2.74 (1.84-4.06)] as a SNP associated with NASH-HCC. Rs641738 in TMC4, which showed association with NAFLD in patients of European descent, was not replicated in our study (p = 0.73), although the complicated LD pattern in the region suggests the necessity for further investigation. The genetic variants of PNPLA3, GCKR, and GATAD2A were then used to estimate the risk for NAFLD. The obtained Polygenic Risk Scores showed that the risk for NAFLD increased with the accumulation of risk alleles [AUC (95%CI) = 0.65 (0.63-0.67)].	 11315092 21381068 23128226 22719876 22314430 12105842 19715440 22258181 18462017 20625834 26873399 26337813 24607626 21490074 23333103 10348825 21320639 21360720 16012941 25302781 18820647 25477264 26482880 17701901 26707365 25935633 26850495 22095588 21167468 19541915 26911352 21423719 24531328
29408531	The polymorphism rs671 at ALDH2 associated with serum uric acid levels in Chinese Han males: A genome-wide association study.	Serum uric acid (SUA) levels are highly heritable and an increased SUA level is one of important risk factors for gout, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The genetic variants underlying SUA remains largely unexplored. The aim was to explore new genetic variants underlying SUA in Chinese Han. We performed a genome-wide association study of SUA levels in Han Chinese. The discovery set contained 1634 samples and subsequent replication was comprised of 1649 females and 1169 males. 2620 subjects were recruited in the detailed analysis of rs671, alcohol drinking and SUA. We found a genome-wide significant association between SUA level and the SNP rs671 at ALDH2 (P = 1.2 × 10

29471430	GWAS identifies two novel colorectal cancer loci at 16q24.1 and 20q13.12.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified more than 50 CRC loci. However, most of the previous studies were conducted in European population, and host genetic factors among Japanese population are largely remained to be identified. To identify novel loci in the Japanese population, here, we performed a large-scale GWAS using 6692 cases and 27 178 controls followed by a replication analysis using more than 11 000 case-control samples. We found the significant association of 10 loci (P < 5 × 10-8), including 2 novel loci on 16q24.1 (IRF8-FOXF1, rs847208, P = 3.15 × 10-9 and odds ratio = 1.107 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.071-1.145) and 20q13.12 (TOX2, rs6065668, P = 4.47 × 10-11 and odds ratio = 0.897 with 95% CI of 0.868-0.926). Moreover, 35 previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 regions were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as in the previous studies. SNP rs6065668 was significantly associated with TOX2 expression in the sigmoid colon. In addition, nucleotide substitutions in the regulatory region of TOX2 were predicted to alter the binding of several transcription factors, including KLF5. Our findings elucidate the important role of genetic variations in the development of CRC in the Japanese population.	
29460428	Genomewide Association Study of Alcohol Dependence and Related Traits in a Thai Population.	Alcohol use (both quantity and dependence) is moderately heritable, and genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk genes in European, African, and Asian populations. The most reproducibly identified risk genes affect alcohol metabolism. Well-known functional variants at the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase B and other alcohol dehydrogenases affect risk in European and African ancestry populations. Similarly, variants mapped to these same genes and a well-known null variant that maps to the gene that encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) also affect risk in various Asian populations. In this study, we completed the first GWAS for 3 traits related to alcohol use in a Thai population recruited initially for studies of methamphetamine dependence.	 26365420 22102315 26432245 17194218 2562960 16862161 25171596 6117742 24277619 28937693 24521142 28253921 23909789 20888699 17590536 26176920 29071344 17718397 12759156 21497796 6582480 20534112 23364009 23456092 28485404 24166409 26036284 11054770 17701901 29082582 27911795 27187070 19571811 21270382 19543373 28813562 15896927 19320537

29535710	Genome-Wide Association Study on Immunoglobulin G Glycosylation Patterns.	Immunoglobulin G (IgG), a glycoprotein secreted by plasma B-cells, plays a major role in the human adaptive immune response and are associated with a wide range of diseases. Glycosylation of the Fc binding region of IgGs, responsible for the antibody's effector function, is essential for prompting a proper immune response. This study focuses on the general genetic impact on IgG glycosylation as well as corresponding subclass specificities. To identify genetic loci involved in IgG glycosylation, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)-measured IgG glycopeptides of 1,823 individuals in the Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region (KORA F4) study cohort. In addition, we performed GWAS on subclass-specific ratios of IgG glycans to gain power in identifying genetic factors underlying single enzymatic steps in the glycosylation pathways. We replicated our findings in 1,836 individuals from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). We were able to show subclass-specific genetic influences on single IgG glycan structures. The replicated results indicate that, in addition to genes encoding for glycosyltransferases (i.e., 	 16611701 27653471 24836425 17029568 21372248 25368619 24448550 25727152 21653738 25895110 27713246 25915148 26399680 25008775 25360000 12045153 27173519 16584381 16032513 16032514 18846099 17572673 26405546 22120122 8276465 25900877 26733289 12504015 22257669 26286994 24324808 20616382 25727145 26289314 26473021 29133956 16632515 23382691 25727150 24940944 25664646 25641675 24719452 16251894 3927174 17994628 27677552 26263923 28878392 25431330 28597152 25612675 20042726 19682117 27136596 26708741 22672667 22365975 26185202 23310955 26813784

In the present study, aiming to identify loci associated with osteoporosis, we conducted a joint association study of 2 independent genome-wide association meta-analyses of femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral densities (BMDs): 1) an in-house study of 6 samples involving 7484 subjects, and 2) the GEFOS-seq study of 7 samples involving 32,965 subjects. The in-house samples were imputed by the 1000 genomes project phase 3 reference panel. SNP-based association test was applied to 7,998,108 autosomal SNPs in each meta-analysis, and for each SNP the 2 association signals were then combined for joint analysis and for mutual replication. Combining the evidence from both studies, we identified 2 novel loci associated with BMDs at the genome-wide significance level (α=5.0×10	
29535370	Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human host factors influencing viral severity of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).	Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is an incurable viral infection with severity ranging from asymptomatic to frequent recurrences. The viral shedding rate has been shown as a reproducible HSV-2 severity end point that correlates with lesion rates. We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the role of common human genetic variation in HSV-2 severity. We performed a GWAS on 223 HSV-2-positive participants of European ancestry. Severity was measured by viral shedding rate, as defined by the percent of days PCR+ for HSV-2 DNA over at least 30 days. Analyses were performed under linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and ancestry. There were no genome-wide significant (p < 5E-08) associations with HSV-2 viral shedding rate. The top nonsignificant SNP (rs75932292, p = 6.77E-08) associated with HSV-2 viral shedding was intergenic, with the nearest known biologically interesting gene (ABCA1) ~130 kbp downstream. Several other SNPs approaching significance were in or near genes with viral or neurological associations, including four SNPs in KIF1B. The current study is the first comprehensive genome-wide investigation of human genetic variation in virologic severity of established HSV-2 infection. However, no significant associations were observed with HSV-2 virologic severity, leaving the exact role of human variation in HSV-2 severity unclear.	 19480845 26432245 16862161 20041166 27357231 25297839 14702423 21903980 10431237 18199027 26562701 22552940 21450818 26973067 25244949 20410080 16571820 11530211 19597073 19211593 10727588 10431236 22143225 15031789 24406162 26304982 19158813 24646941 8300099 21288817 20479773 18753235 22039568 25818806 26255971 22262807 17624834 9888879 17701901 22581936 11940086 18348202 19684573 17872438 20234392 20981796 24739678 15450383 23103873 25170080 25700176 15128897 27853144 21160409 22174851 12499305 16327322 20731376 25992922 23047923 21486977 12184549 26578538 24227835
29489655	Genome-wide association study of maternal genetic effects and parent-of-origin effects on food allergy.	Previous genetic studies of food allergy (FA) have mainly focused on inherited genotypic effects. The role of parental genotypic effects remains largely unexplored. Leveraging existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data generated from the Chicago Food Allergy Study, we examined maternal genotypic and parent-of-origin (PO) effects using multinomial likelihood ratio tests in 588 complete and incomplete Caucasian FA trios. We identified 1 single nucleotide polymorphism with significant (P < 5×10) maternal effect on any FA (rs4235235), which is located in a noncoding RNA (LOC101927947) with unknown function. We also identified 3 suggestive (P < 5×10) loci with maternal genetic effects: 1 for any FA (rs976078, in a gene desert region on 13q31.1) and 2 for egg allergy (rs1343795 and rs4572450, in the ZNF652 gene, where genetic variants have been associated with atopic dermatitis). Three suggestive loci with PO effect were observed: 1 for peanut allergy (rs4896888 in the ADGB gene) and 2 for any FA in boys only (rs1036504 and rs2917750 in the IQCE gene). Findings from this family-based GWAS of FA provided some preliminary evidence on maternal genotypic or PO effects on FA. Additional family-based studies are needed to confirm our findings and gain new insight into maternal and paternal genetic contribution to FA.	 15131561 10887305 22738121 23727859 25710614 16950836 23443026 26188062 21277522 24284354 16455349 8789975 21377035 12058257 16802776 20975795 9641569 21690110 9515587 25818895 19851108 20850383 19430483 19016802 24903222 21397060 21181895 10631165
29615537	Strong impact of natural-selection-free heterogeneity in genetics of age-related phenotypes.	A conceptual difficulty in genetics of age-related phenotypes that make individuals vulnerable to disease in post-reproductive life is genetic heterogeneity attributed to an undefined role of evolution in establishing their molecular mechanisms. Here, we performed univariate and pleiotropic genome-wide meta-analyses of 20 age-related phenotypes leveraging longitudinal information in a sample of 33,431 individuals and dealing with the natural-selection-free genetic heterogeneity. We identified 142 non-proxy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with phenotype-specific (18 SNPs) and pleiotropic (124 SNPs) associations at genome-wide level. Univariate meta-analysis identified two novel (11.1%) and replicated 16 SNPs whereas pleiotropic meta-analysis identified 115 novel (92.7%) and nine replicated SNPs. Pleiotropic associations for most novel (93.9%) and all replicated SNPs were strongly impacted by the natural-selection-free genetic heterogeneity in its unconventional form of antagonistic heterogeneity, implying antagonistic directions of genetic effects for directly correlated phenotypes. Our results show that the common genome-wide approach is well adapted to handle homogeneous univariate associations within Mendelian framework whereas most associations with age-related phenotypes are more complex and well beyond that framework. Dissecting the natural-selection-free genetic heterogeneity is critical for gaining insights into genetics of age-related phenotypes and has substantial and unexplored yet potential for improving efficiency of genome-wide analysis.	 4827368 18323530 20018020 25272642 18987709 22241776 17372189 28854176 17502601 21824675 23571845 21651395 25893220 20569235 2646917 25500260 26909101 24316577 1342297 22482725 23768105 21164525 25925459 19859063 19369658 20686565 12004104 12397006 15608251 27832069 20616382 24931982 25159268 15556674 21155765 12925518 16645027 27447179 24675618 19955444 19010253 20018085 17701901 26785476 19369660 27739495 26677855 19131956 22544168 15660509 26258126 19543373 1669507 19282116 27683205 26306600 27832070

Heart rate (HR) responds to exercise by increasing during exercise and recovering after exercise. As such, HR is an important predictor of mortality that researchers believe is modulated by the autonomic nervous system. However, the mechanistic basis underlying inter-individual differences has yet to be explained. Here, we perform a large-scale genome-wide analysis of HR increase and HR recovery in 58,818 UK Biobank individuals.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 94,674 ancestrally diverse Kaiser Permanente members using 478,866 longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived measurements for untreated serum lipid levels empowered multiple new findings: 121 new SNP associations (46 primary, 15 conditional, and 60 in meta-analysis with Global Lipids Genetic Consortium data); an increase of 33-42% in variance explained with multiple measurements; sex differences in genetic impact (greater impact in females for LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and the opposite for triglycerides); differences in variance explained among non-Hispanic whites, Latinos, African Americans, and East Asians; genetic dominance and epistatic interaction, with strong evidence for both at the ABO and FUT2 genes for LDL; and tissue-specific enrichment of GWAS-associated SNPs among liver, adipose, and pancreas eQTLs. Using EHR pharmacy data, both LDL and triglyceride genetic risk scores (477 SNPs) were strongly predictive of age at initiation of lipid-lowering treatment. These findings highlight the value of longitudinal EHRs for identifying new genetic features of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism with implications for lipid treatment and risk of coronary heart disease.	 4337382 26748516 23726366 18987709 10601278 22829776 26366554 24688311 24886709 22384356 26367797 21566258 23236364 22138821 22629316 24013639 24037378 25907923 22064851 28008009 27571263 25170055 10358072 23555291 26092718 22820512 26092716 19414484 21565292 18462017 25860611 20686565 17937387 26780889 16784338 18650507 20369019 27466198 25722852 21376301 21966465 22955987 10334993 20517342 24975945 7835232 13751193 25961943 29083408 24990607 19952871 26373568 27694958 25249183 25642633 22183894 12695357 26582766 27036123 26199122 23434905 8798464 25826379 24023261 22539988 29083407 23918046 17701901 26763881 21407268 21602305 24097068 21167468 21565264 24817879 21441907 10559017 27841878 21247428 20601685 19543373 19215730 21903159 25954001 3179802

29534260	Two Genetic Variants Associated with Plantar Fascial Disorders.	Plantar fascial disorder is comprised of plantar fasciitis and plantar fibromatosis. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, especially for athletes involved in running and jumping sports. Plantar fibromatosis is a rare fibrous hyperproliferation of the deep connective tissue of the foot. To identify genetic loci associated with plantar fascial disorders, a genome-wide association screen was performed using publically available data from the Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health including 21,624 cases of plantar fascial disorders and 80,879 controls. One indel (chr5:118704153:D) and one SNP (rs62051384) showed an association with plantar fascial disorders at genome-wide significance (p<5×10	
29558500	Genome-wide association analysis identifies multiple loci associated with kidney disease-related traits in Korean populations.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important social health problem characterized by a decrease in the kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In this study, we analyzed genome-wide association studies for kidney disease-related traits using data from a Korean adult health screening cohort comprising 7,064 participants. Kidney disease-related traits analyzed include blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, estimated GFR, and uric acid levels. We detected two genetic loci (SLC14A2 and an intergenic region) and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BUN, 3 genetic loci (BCAS3, C17orf82, ALDH2) and 6 SNPs associated with serum creatinine, 3 genetic loci (BCAS3, C17orf82/TBX2, LRP2) and 7 SNPs associated with GFR, and 14 genetic loci (3 in ABCG2/PKD2, 2 in SLC2A9, 3 in intergenic regions on chromosome 4; OTUB1, NRXN2/SLC22A12, CDC42BPG, RPS6KA4, SLC22A9, and MAP4K2 on chromosome 11) and 84 SNPs associated with uric acid levels. By comparing significant genetic loci associated with serum creatinine levels and GFR, rs9895661 in BCAS3 and rs757608 in C17orf82 were simultaneously associated with both traits. The SNPs rs11710227 in intergenic regions on chromosome 3 showing significant association with BUN is newly discovered. Genetic variations of multiple gene loci are associated with kidney disease-related traits, and differences in associations between kidney disease-related traits and genetic variation are dependent on the population. The meanings of the mutations identified in this study will need to be reaffirmed in other population groups in the future.	 26881969 18974607 26835700 24742479 16920156 16862161 18391951 25476142 22229870 20210838 19260141 20368174 17568785 24029420 17555489 19506252 28545421 23049088 24628802 20714133 18216179 26607700 24947413 18824160 26831199 21294900 26603249 19890391 16365683 17903292 20383145 19893584 22797727 16253630 19503597 25435339 19877038 27167337 18327256 28154504 25431208 20383146 18834626 25257975 21085059 23563607 18794856 16837472 15822051 24311711 25833971 26617691 20546612 19266077 23028791 20421215 24821702 19430482 15318096 20139978 22609445 26506822 17344938 18327257 19921266 19019168 20858603 21768215 26167684 19833602 11590132 3516645 25922070 19396169 21909109 18759275 20884846 25705157 21399635 16385546 18179892 17997608

29563342	Untargeted metabolomics identifies trimethyllysine, a TMAO-producing nutrient precursor, as a predictor of incident cardiovascular disease risk.	Using an untargeted metabolomics approach in initial (N = 99 subjects) and replication cohorts (N = 1,162), we discovered and structurally identified a plasma metabolite associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks, N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine (trimethyllysine, TML). Stable-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry analyses of an independent validation cohort (N = 2,140) confirmed TML levels are independently associated with incident (3-year) major adverse cardiovascular event risks (hazards ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4) and incident (5-year) mortality risk (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.2). Genome-wide association studies identified several suggestive loci for TML levels, but none reached genome-wide significance; and d9(trimethyl)-TML isotope tracer studies confirmed TML can serve as a nutrient precursor for gut microbiota-dependent generation of trimethylamine (TMA) and the atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Although TML was shown to be abundant in both plant- and animal-derived foods, mouse and human fecal cultures (omnivores and vegans) showed slow conversion of TML to TMA. Furthermore, unlike chronic dietary choline, TML supplementation in mice failed to elevate plasma TMAO or heighten thrombosis potential in vivo. Thus, TML is identified as a strong predictor of incident CVD risks in subjects and to serve as a dietary precursor for gut microbiota-dependent generation of TMAO; however, TML does not appear to be a major microbial source for TMAO generation in vivo.	 24704102 16362057 28007146 17127277 25550161 11802770 11420716 23614584 25938372 27419259 17828273 29021384 27792653 24591617 27642271 26687352 18581285 18497330 26343387 27824832 17320507 27864387 23151509 25784704 28436590 28457845 15620353 21475195 26972052 22194010 17701901 25440057 23563705 15260992 27504778 27663237 24497336 24454731 20650010
29628937	A Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies of Growth Differentiation Factor-15 Concentration in Blood.	Blood levels of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), have been associated with various pathological processes and diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Prior studies suggest genetic factors play a role in regulating blood MIC-1/GDF-15 concentration. In the current study, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date using a sample of ∼5,400 community-based Caucasian participants, to determine the genetic variants associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration. Conditional and joint (COJO), gene-based association, and gene-set enrichment analyses were also carried out to identify novel loci, genes, and pathways.

29617998	Genome-wide association analyses identify new loci influencing intraocular pressure.	Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Recently established of biobank repositories have resulted in large amounts of data, enabling the identification of the remaining heritability for complex traits. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study of IOP to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We identified 671 directly genotyped variants that are significantly associated with IOP (P < 5 × 10-8). In addition to 103 novel loci, the top ranked novel IOP genes are LMX1B, NR1H3, MADD and SEPT9. We replicated these findings in an external population and examined the pleiotropic nature of these loci. These discoveries not only further our understanding of the genetic architecture of IOP, but also shed new light on the biological processes underlying glaucoma.	 24954072 17716734 9780093 9115275 9618165 27270105 19434714 26523775 19151388 24699378 12368482 21917936 12365904 21254223 25642630 12897786 27654570 28472511 11431443 24518671 10660670 28073927 18952915 29235454 15722304 25173106 27435222 15939473 18669541 19836009 25722852 22570627 10842357 16723463 24975945 25254373 24553384 23572511 12049574 10815159 23836780 25637523 25642633 15996506 18271029 12119218 26766402 25826379 16825280 23415156 24002674 18486096 21167468 22594632 22863193 18313051

29618737	Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis identify loci associated with ventricular and supraventricular ectopy.	The genetic basis of supraventricular and ventricular ectopy (SVE, VE) remains largely uncharacterized, despite established genetic mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis. To identify novel genetic variants associated with SVE/VE in ancestrally diverse human populations, we conducted a genome-wide association study of electrocardiographically identified SVE and VE in five cohorts including approximately 43,000 participants of African, European and Hispanic/Latino ancestry. In thirteen ancestry-stratified subgroups, we tested multivariable-adjusted associations of SVE and VE with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dosage. We combined subgroup-specific association estimates in inverse variance-weighted, fixed-effects and Bayesian meta-analyses. We also combined fixed-effects meta-analytic t-test statistics for SVE and VE in multi-trait SNP association analyses. No loci reached genome-wide significance in trans-ethnic meta-analyses. However, we found genome-wide significant SNPs intronic to an apoptosis-enhancing gene previously associated with QRS interval duration (FAF1; lead SNP rs7545860; effect allele frequency = 0.02; P = 2.0 × 10	 20609343 12821245 16862161 21212386 26493956 17041126 9492970 22125221 2797341 2646917 18979352 24016621 24068893 27659466 11868062 27075728 14575939 19763151 12397006 28058808 21376301 22821350 23927786 25055868 3233245 23281413 3825900 20172911 24819898 25810074 27186178 24995013 21076409 21167468 20404258 9682893 23048073 1720531 2394145 1669507 28883840 26657631

29621232	Identification and functional analysis of glycemic trait loci in the China Health and Nutrition Survey.	To identify genetic contributions to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c), we conducted genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) in up to 7,178 Chinese subjects from nine provinces in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). We examined patterns of population structure within CHNS and found that allele frequencies differed across provinces, consistent with genetic drift and population substructure. We further validated 32 previously described T2D- and glycemic trait-loci, including G6PC2 and SIX3-SIX2 associated with fasting glucose. At G6PC2, we replicated a known fasting glucose-associated variant (rs34177044) and identified a second signal (rs2232326), a low-frequency (4%), probably damaging missense variant (S324P). A variant within the lead fasting glucose-associated signal at SIX3-SIX2 co-localized with pancreatic islet expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for SIX3, SIX2, and three noncoding transcripts. To identify variants functionally responsible for the fasting glucose association at SIX3-SIX2, we tested five candidate variants for allelic differences in regulatory function. The rs12712928-C allele, associated with higher fasting glucose and lower transcript expression level, showed lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays and increased binding to GABP compared to the rs12712928-G, suggesting that rs12712928-C contributes to elevated fasting glucose levels by disrupting an islet enhancer, resulting in reduced gene expression. Taken together, these analyses identified multiple loci associated with glycemic traits across China, and suggest a regulatory mechanism at the SIX3-SIX2 fasting glucose GWAS locus.	 26531826 27314675 10927996 20858683 19944404 27270109 25693563 28257690 26432245 27416945 24647736 26160912 21378990 27899622 23508304 26683364 24013639 20944595 27571263 25201977 24244560 19887509 27133132 25625282 24196873 25187374 23788246 28193859 19096518 18462017 19060907 22955616 20581827 24142592 21115973 24105470 26551672 24891020 27398621 21873549 25631608 25961943 20383146 18521185 24509480 23715323 25211022 26139635 18711366 18451265 24670763 22581228 21938619 22885924 24659834 26432246 20634204 27618452 25673412 24915262 23251661 24097068 20622168 27321945 25673413 21909109 2163307 20926424 21441907 22885922 19875614 20081857 10078554 28684635 26637976 26657631 26132169 20081858 28566273 25954001 23551121 27851967 20208533

30134803	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci associated with parathyroid hormone level.	Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is one of the principal regulators of calcium homeostasis. Although serum PTH level is mostly accounted by genetic factors, genetic background underlying PTH level is insufficiently known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel genetic variants associated with PTH levels.	 17384015 24068962 22272569 15899954 26791959 17903296 26201295 25429064 10935639 15887856 18322453 17572673 20881960 15882315 25740212 18299475 21164021 14566338 27927781 27065162 3141451 20383146 19645719 28138323 19595349 28680352 7615802 20634204 24142639 18327257 26021763 11204437 19260138 1900290 3012979 16213650 1662321
29659830	Genome-wide association study identifies nine novel loci for 2D:4D finger ratio, a putative retrospective biomarker of testosterone exposure in utero.	The ratio of the length of the index finger to that of the ring finger (2D:4D) is sexually dimorphic and is commonly used as a non-invasive biomarker of prenatal androgen exposure. Most association studies of 2D:4D ratio with a diverse range of sex-specific traits have typically involved small sample sizes and have been difficult to replicate, raising questions around the utility and precise meaning of the measure. In the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of 2D:4D ratio to date (N = 15 661, with replication N = 75 821), we identified 11 loci (9 novel) explaining 3.8% of the variance in mean 2D:4D ratio. We also found weak evidence for association (β = 0.06; P = 0.02) between 2D:4D ratio and sensitivity to testosterone [length of the CAG microsatellite repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene] in females only. Furthermore, genetic variants associated with (adult) testosterone levels and/or sex hormone-binding globulin were not associated with 2D:4D ratio in our sample. Although we were unable to find strong evidence from our genetic study to support the hypothesis that 2D:4D ratio is a direct biomarker of prenatal exposure to androgens in healthy individuals, our findings do not explicitly exclude this possibility, and pathways involving testosterone may become apparent as the size of the discovery sample increases further. Our findings provide new insight into the underlying biology shaping 2D:4D variation in the general population.	 3910535 19448621 10828555 16040033 25224860 22829776 24766144 9363887 24013635 8065934 17451014 23273568 20303062 24968011 28743860 25597830 474629 24367354 23239739 23258944 25799145 14432658 27481995 23575643 12971829 28224613 18794802 21468594 22675492 20190752 21194680 22340503 25762173 18391950 20676098 21998597 19708418 20169177 20881960 18498211 16011922 12959899 23754753 16504142 11102974 25282103 22843982 20616382 24390342 25116409 15273869 23535732 21637794 25019194 26414676 24553384 9853845 24357060 16611491 22001757 24315451 18074216 16688484 25302588 19838193 5042490 19530144 20299156 22936694 10610715 19819951 25242253 22426310 24097068 21167468 24949031 27193062 23263445 25673413 21194678 12042312 15113628 25250010 17032503 20027305 21750680 24945404 23715323

29662168	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of individuals of European ancestry identifies new loci explaining a substantial fraction of hair color variation and heritability.	Hair color is one of the most recognizable visual traits in European populations and is under strong genetic control. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of almost 300,000 participants of European descent. We identified 123 autosomal and one X-chromosome loci significantly associated with hair color; all but 13 are novel. Collectively, single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with hair color within these loci explain 34.6% of red hair, 24.8% of blond hair, and 26.1% of black hair heritability in the study populations. These results confirm the polygenic nature of complex phenotypes and improve our understanding of melanin pigment metabolism in humans.	 18483556 11315092 17314970 22234890 23548203 675247 17952075 12573076 25963972 20445093 26184321 20585627 10896812 22556244 17182896 18435620 24528593 18488028 20369019 21376301 27738015 18971261 11602344 24573849 21407268 16685728 24616518 20042077 22917817

29682794	Genetic associations with childhood brain growth, defined in two longitudinal cohorts.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are unraveling the genetics of adult brain neuroanatomy as measured by cross-sectional anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI). However, the genetic mechanisms that shape childhood brain development are, as yet, largely unexplored. In this study we identify common genetic variants associated with childhood brain development as defined by longitudinal aMRI. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were determined in two cohorts: one enriched for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (LONG cohort: 458 participants; 119 with ADHD) and the other from a population-based cohort (Generation R: 257 participants). The growth of the brain's major regions (cerebral cortex, white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) and one region of interest (the right lateral prefrontal cortex) were defined on all individuals from two aMRIs, and a GWAS and a pathway analysis were performed. In addition, association between polygenic risk for ADHD and brain growth was determined for the LONG cohort. For white matter growth, GWAS meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant intergenic SNP (rs12386571, P = 9.09 × 10	 22675527 28070760 24954827 10671382 21085203 23774715 23599091 21735171 23903335 19706366 22745009 21886580 25550326 17469173 25762173 25887478 21672310 22748210 22761806 16077740 22504417 27004716 12365958 17403979 21159727 20920490 18852200 17415783 24579201 22176936 10638068 23354984 23488575 15749242 17073977 22717648 20732625 25225387 22504421 28580697 17885575 27980666 18077397 22522443 19648217 12865374 12892153 20496382 15935993 20208533

29739359	Genome-wide association studies for diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are sight-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus and leading causes of adult-onset blindness worldwide. Genetic risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have been described previously, but have been difficult to replicate between studies, which have often used composite phenotypes and been conducted in different populations. This study aims to identify genetic risk factors for DME and PDR as separate complications in Australians of European descent with type 2 diabetes.	 12716671 15078674 24957500 16862161 26188370 21441570 23201682 26177037 24952107 19956104 13129861 12145228 24112246 21437630 19557197 17618154 16751711 26950426 26209985 19587357 26915668 12766102 18443200 18765632 25364816 20871662 23500522 21310492 17701901 22716474 25948278 25819896 23562823 22301125 11543634 21674055

29750799	Population-specific genetic modification of Huntington's disease in Venezuela.	Modifiers of Mendelian disorders can provide insights into disease mechanisms and guide therapeutic strategies. A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study discovered genetic modifiers of Huntington's disease (HD) onset in Europeans. Here, we performed whole genome sequencing and GWA analysis of a Venezuelan HD cluster whose families were crucial for the original mapping of the HD gene defect. The Venezuelan HD subjects develop motor symptoms earlier than their European counterparts, implying the potential for population-specific modifiers. The main Venezuelan HD family inherits HTT haplotype hap.03, which differs subtly at the sequence level from European HD hap.03, suggesting a different ancestral origin but not explaining the earlier age at onset in these Venezuelans. GWA analysis of the Venezuelan HD cluster suggests both population-specific and population-shared genetic modifiers. Genome-wide significant signals at 7p21.2-21.1 and suggestive association signals at 4p14 and 17q21.2 are evident only in Venezuelan HD, but genome-wide significant association signals at the established European chromosome 15 modifier locus are improved when Venezuelan HD data are included in the meta-analysis. Venezuelan-specific association signals on chromosome 7 center on SOSTDC1, which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein antagonist. The corresponding SNPs are associated with reduced expression of SOSTDC1 in non-Venezuelan tissue samples, suggesting that interaction of reduced SOSTDC1 expression with a population-specific genetic or environmental factor may be responsible for modification of HD onset in Venezuela. Detection of population-specific modification in Venezuelan HD supports the value of distinct disease populations in revealing novel aspects of a disease and population-relevant therapeutic strategies.	 12784292 19588392 25154728 24886709 15020244 26232222 8252042 14993615 21080955 18481795 20360314 6316146 28832564 25656686 16179481 27188817 9398841 2886227 7550343 8064815 7668260 12615650 17417937 28172889 26780889 8401589 26805783 26320893 9887339 25736541 2890209 19030899 20339536 15951218 27667189 23830730 23463025 8401588 8458085 19249009 22323755 14623234 26378658 16965319 22379007 23595883 21452313 27296613 7668287 22387017 8401587 26178794 26444025 26849111 7774020 17701901 8659522 24057671 25216369 12900792 17240289 1302016 10518566 28934397 9173995 18032587 19588393 16205714 26503961

29771307	Assessment of rosacea symptom severity by genome-wide association study and expression analysis highlights immuno-inflammatory and skin pigmentation genes.	Rosacea is a common, chronic skin disease of variable severity with limited treatment options. The cause of rosacea is unknown, but it is believed to be due to a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Little is known about the genetics of the disease. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of rosacea symptom severity with data from 73,265 research participants of European ancestry from the 23andMe customer base. Seven loci had variants associated with rosacea at the genome-wide significance level (p≤5 × 10-8). Further analyses highlighted likely gene regions or effector genes including IRF4 (p=1.5 × 10-17), an HLA region flanked by PSMB9 and HLA-DMB (p=2.2 × 10-15), HERC2-OCA2 (p=4.2 × 10-12), SLC45A2 (p=1.7 × 10-10), IL13 (p=2.8 × 10-09), a region flanked by NRXN3 and DIO2 (p=4.1 × 10-9), and a region flanked by OVOL1and SNX32 (p=1.2 × 10-8). All associations with rosacea were novel except for the HLA locus. Two of these loci (HERC-OCA2, SLC45A2) and another precedented variant (rs1805007 in MC1R) with an association p value just below the significance threshold (p=1.3 × 10-7) have been previously associated with skin phenotypes and pigmentation, two of these loci are linked to immuno-inflammation phenotypes (IL13, PSMB9-HLA-DMA) and one has been associated with both categories (IRF4). Genes within three loci (PSMB9-HLA-DMA, HERC-OCA2, and NRX3-DIO2) were differentially expressed in a previously published clinical rosacea transcriptomics study that compared lesional to non-lesional samples. The identified loci provide specificity of inflammatory mechanisms in rosacea, and identify potential pathways for therapeutic intervention.	
29769613	Genetic variant for behavioral regulation factor of executive function and its possible brain mechanism in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	As a childhood-onset psychiatric disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is complicated by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Lifelong executive function deficits in ADHD are described in many literatures and have been proposed as endophenotypes of ADHD. However, its genetic basis is still elusive. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study of executive function, rated with Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), in ADHD children. We identified one significant variant (rs852004, P = 2.51e-08) for the overall score of BRIEF. The association analyses for each component of executive function found this locus was more associated with inhibit and monitor components. Further principle component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis provided an ADHD-specific executive function pattern including inhibit and monitor factors. SNP rs852004 was mainly associated with the Behavioral Regulation factor. Meanwhile, we found the significant locus was associated with ADHD symptom. The Behavioral Regulation factor mediated its effect on ADHD symptom. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses further showed evidence that this variant affected the activity of inhibition control related brain regions. It provided new insights for the genetic basis of executive function in ADHD.	 27183902 12377157 25693563 20081856 12759822 17194218 22420046 16862161 17613979 22212596 23128226 11419452 15076256 15110032 22064851 18684514 15950004 19715440 24694013 20145962 22012869 20832056 20085608 23283688 28416812 25470396 22351433 26503253 23247506 22182935 23728934 26688289 23684970 24261515 20732625 19506906 9673998 23978501 17701901 23074066 24176104 20351726 22171328 19380588 19933162 16197923 27276220 15213704 27282384 26572659 25954001
29769526	A whole-genome sequence study identifies genetic risk factors for neuromyelitis optica.	Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the optic nerve and spinal cord. Most NMO patients ( > 70%) are seropositive for circulating autoantibodies against aquaporin 4 (NMO-IgG+). Here, we meta-analyze whole-genome sequences from 86 NMO cases and 460 controls with genome-wide SNP array from 129 NMO cases and 784 controls to test for association with SNPs and copy number variation (total N = 215 NMO cases, 1244 controls). We identify two independent signals in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region associated with NMO-IgG+, one of which may be explained by structural variation in the complement component 4 genes. Mendelian Randomization analysis reveals a significant causal effect of known systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but not multiple sclerosis (MS), risk variants in NMO-IgG+. Our results suggest that genetic variants in the MHC region contribute to the etiology of NMO-IgG+ and that NMO-IgG+ is genetically more similar to SLE than MS.	 25621458 22387014 23762245 16717206 26502338 22608667 25431634 24636642 20644199 19850125 17503323 25028724 20616382 26814963 24832354 23650244 8538770 21478889 27694958 22308524 25109258 24076602 12367531 21317889 17124341 15589308 19995845 26748515 18195142 19299434 23520529

29782485	Evaluation and application of summary statistic imputation to discover new height-associated loci.	As most of the heritability of complex traits is attributed to common and low frequency genetic variants, imputing them by combining genotyping chips and large sequenced reference panels is the most cost-effective approach to discover the genetic basis of these traits. Association summary statistics from genome-wide meta-analyses are available for hundreds of traits. Updating these to ever-increasing reference panels is very cumbersome as it requires reimputation of the genetic data, rerunning the association scan, and meta-analysing the results. A much more efficient method is to directly impute the summary statistics, termed as summary statistics imputation, which we improved to accommodate variable sample size across SNVs. Its performance relative to genotype imputation and practical utility has not yet been fully investigated. To this end, we compared the two approaches on real (genotyped and imputed) data from 120K samples from the UK Biobank and show that, genotype imputation boasts a 3- to 5-fold lower root-mean-square error, and better distinguishes true associations from null ones: We observed the largest differences in power for variants with low minor allele frequency and low imputation quality. For fixed false positive rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, using summary statistics imputation yielded a decrease in statistical power by 9, 43 and 35%, respectively. To test its capacity to discover novel associations, we applied summary statistics imputation to the GIANT height meta-analysis summary statistics covering HapMap variants, and identified 34 novel loci, 19 of which replicated using data in the UK Biobank. Additionally, we successfully replicated 55 out of the 111 variants published in an exome chip study. Our study demonstrates that summary statistics imputation is a very efficient and cost-effective way to identify and fine-map trait-associated loci. Moreover, the ability to impute summary statistics is important for follow-up analyses, such as Mendelian randomisation or LD-score regression.	 27548312 16646851 22507743 18427557 23990413 22384356 20543033 20562875 27005778 22253318 21479081 27318201 25642630 21896673 26192919 17572673 23696881 20881960 25282103 24390342 24702953 28146470 28506277 24990607 18271029 25279928 21058334 25338720 25826379 27840428 24572353 21653516 22426310 20981092 24097068 24114802 22885922 25954001 25505091

29860282	Genetic study of multimodal imaging Alzheimer's disease progression score implicates novel loci.	Identifying genetic risk factors underpinning different aspects of Alzheimer's disease has the potential to provide important insights into pathogenesis. Moving away from simple case-control definitions, there is considerable interest in using quantitative endophenotypes, such as those derived from imaging as outcome measures. Previous genome-wide association studies of imaging-derived biomarkers in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease focused only on phenotypes derived from single imaging modalities. In contrast, we computed a novel multi-modal neuroimaging phenotype comprising cortical amyloid burden and bilateral hippocampal volume. Both imaging biomarkers were used as input to a disease progression modelling algorithm, which estimates the biomarkers' long-term evolution curves from population-based longitudinal data. Among other parameters, the algorithm computes the shift in time required to optimally align a subjects' biomarker trajectories with these population curves. This time shift serves as a disease progression score and it was used as a quantitative trait in a discovery genome-wide association study with n = 944 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment or healthy at the time of imaging. We identified a genome-wide significant locus implicating LCORL (rs6850306, chromosome 4; P = 1.03 × 10-8). The top variant rs6850306 was found to act as an expression quantitative trait locus for LCORL in brain tissue. The clinical role of rs6850306 in conversion from healthy ageing to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease was further validated in an independent cohort comprising healthy, older subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Specifically, possession of a minor allele at rs6850306 was protective against conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort (hazard ratio = 0.593, 95% confidence interval = 0.387-0.907, n = 911, PBonf = 0.032), in keeping with the negative direction of effect reported in the genome-wide association study (βdisease progression score = -0.07 ± 0.01). The implicated locus is linked to genes with known connections to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and other neurodegenerative diseases. Using multimodal imaging phenotypes in association studies may assist in unveiling the genetic drivers of the onset and progression of complex diseases.	 26268243 25879909 25652077 25174004 22567092 26088679 11832223 22138821 20062101 25352553 26490334 26170135 20100581 23419831 18755822 24656849 19019849 20083042 24413527 17572673 26268530 19668339 20451870 26754641 17676998 25282103 25722852 27268795 20517342 23562540 26414676 22281676 20811451 19251758 22801491 26545630 18271029 25745095 24162737 25112433 20451875 16511335 20634204 26691988 25967550 25640676 18302232 20981092 27548312 19339712 20385819 20171287 23539302 23332364 14819398 8350998 16242812
29848360	Genome-wide association study meta-analysis identifies five new loci for systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common systemic autoimmune disease with a complex genetic inheritance. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have significantly increased the number of significant loci associated with SLE risk. To date, however, established loci account for less than 30% of the disease heritability and additional risk variants have yet to be identified. Here we performed a GWAS followed by a meta-analysis to identify new genome-wide significant loci for SLE.	 28137298 26808494 16761508 16862161 24068666 12514734 24243840 23128226 20699234 24013639 24037378 26502338 15235609 25581432 19483719 17572673 20169177 26878310 23223229 27399966 25990289 28686856 20616382 24390342 22378189 26476454 24105423 26743605 26983453 22110124 20533545 23950730 7138600 19165918 29358691 17701901 18204446 27813071 23269371 20074509 20981092 19838195 26121088 25693562 27872476 23868113
29855589	GWAS reveals loci associated with velopharyngeal dysfunction.	Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) occurs when the muscular soft palate (velum) and lateral pharyngeal walls are physically unable to separate the oral and nasal cavities during speech production leading to hypernasality and abnormal speech reduction. Because VPD is often associated with overt or submucous cleft palate, it could be present as a subclinical phenotype in families with a history of orofacial clefting. A key assumption to this model is that the overt and subclinical manifestations of the orofacial cleft phenotype exist on a continuum and therefore share common etiological factors. We performed a genome-wide association study in 976 unaffected relatives of isolated CP probands, 54 of whom had VPD. Five loci were significantly (p < 5 × 10	 28538580 26130485 14986834 26561393 11903361 19732862 27033726 25704602 21948641 27617110 22436304 24563486 28838066 21295280 16405378 18471269 21931569 25691422 7188066 3877111 28441456 17130149 25921602 17328262 20634204 20662904 26288816 26601549 7243986 27362800 27018475 25604261 19543373 20208533
29885931	Genome-wide association studies suggest that APOL1-environment interactions more likely trigger kidney disease in African Americans with nondiabetic nephropathy than strong APOL1-second gene interactions.	African Americans carrying two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal risk variants have a high risk for nephropathy. However, only a minority develops end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hence, modifying factors likely contribute to initiation of kidney disease such as endogenous (HIV infection) or exogenous (interferon treatment) environmental modifiers. In this report, genome-wide association studies and a meta-analysis were performed to identify novel loci for nondiabetic ESRD in African Americans and to detect genetic modifiers in APOL1-associated nephropathy. Two African American cohorts were analyzed, 1749 nondiabetic ESRD cases and 1136 controls from Wake Forest and 901 lupus nephritis (LN)-ESRD cases and 520 controls with systemic lupus erythematosus but lacking nephropathy from the LN-ESRD Consortium. Association analyses adjusting for APOL1 G1/G2 renal-risk variants were completed and stratified by APOL1 risk genotype status. Individual genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis results of all 2650 ESRD cases and 1656 controls did not detect significant genome-wide associations with ESRD beyond APOL1. Similarly, no single nucleotide polymorphism showed significant genome-wide evidence of an interaction with APOL1 risk variants. Thus, although variants with small individual effects cannot be ruled out and are likely to exist, our results suggest that APOL1-environment interactions may be of greater clinical importance in triggering nephropathy in African Americans than APOL1 interactions with other single nucleotide polymorphisms.	 28372594 22495753 23438974 19471322 21997394 28233270 28253088 22064851 23677244 20818902 24504811 25100047 21849968 28391347 28201750 24157943 20668430 15500911 24903390 28410362 22955989 28441430 24137013 26940095 20532800 19648217 17216203 23520206 19543373 26586272 9265696 28280138 25788523 28143671 28339911 26551272

29907492	Polygenic risk score, genome-wide association, and gene set analyses of cognitive domain deficits in schizophrenia.	This study assessed genetic contributions to six cognitive domains, identified by the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery as relevant for schizophrenia, cognition-enhancing, clinical trials. Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia polygenic risk scores showed significant negative correlations with each cognitive domain. Genome-wide association analyses identified loci associated with attention/vigilance (rs830786 within HNF4G), verbal memory (rs67017972 near NDUFS4), and reasoning/problem solving (rs76872642 within HDAC9). Gene set analysis identified unique and shared genes across cognitive domains. These findings suggest involvement of common and unique mechanisms across cognitive domains and may contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.	 18172018 20298200 25644384 26432245 21926974 19721432 25056061 27003162 23732972 28746715 17073821 27571263 24548631 19734545 25084529 25608650 12106776 25560755 23419543 26809841 18184693 18172019 27604177 27872257 29230059 10682218 26586142 23925787 27754483 20626912 24342994 18160262 17701901 21167468 6539584 16038679 25445625 28327638 25537281 23225872 28093568 25522158

29924316	Genome-wide association study of familial lung cancer.	To identify genetic variation associated with lung cancer risk, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 685 lung cancer cases that had a family history of two or more first or second degree relatives compared with 744 controls without lung cancer that were genotyped on an Illumina Human OmniExpressExome-8v1 array. To ensure robust results, we further evaluated these findings using data from six additional studies that were assembled through the Transdisciplinary Research on Cancer of the Lung Consortium comprising 1993 familial cases and 33 690 controls. We performed a meta-analysis after imputation of all variants using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (version 3 release date September 2013). Analyses were conducted for 9 327 222 SNPs integrating data from the two sources. A novel variant on chromosome 4p15.31 near the LCORL gene and an imputed rare variant intergenic between CDKN2A and IFNA8 on chromosome 9p21.3 were identified at a genome-wide level of significance for squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, associations of CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25.1 in sporadic lung cancer were confirmed at a genome-wide level of significance in familial lung cancer. Previously identified variants in or near CHRNA2, BRCA2, CYP2A6 for overall lung cancer, TERT, SECISPB2L and RTEL1 for adenocarcinoma and RAD52 and MHC for squamous carcinoma were significantly associated with lung cancer.	 18974171 20383776 18385676 28106732 21858091 22899653 24120142 2374177 22820512 7810562 12802680 18978790 23209423 19584899 20215501 18385738 21335511 8797515 15272417 24880342 18385739 22585858 25631445 25855536 28817824 28604730 22426310 21167468 18519524 25640678 23651189 25187487 19836008 28615365 22754767 23430818

Prior studies suggest dental caries traits in children and adolescents are partially heritable, but there has been no large-scale consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date. We therefore performed GWAS for caries in participants aged 2.5-18.0 years from nine contributing centres. Phenotype definitions were created for the presence or absence of treated or untreated caries, stratified by primary and permanent dentition. All studies tested for association between caries and genotype dosage and the results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Analysis included up to 19 003 individuals (7530 affected) for primary teeth and 13 353 individuals (5875 affected) for permanent teeth. Evidence for association with caries status was observed at rs1594318-C for primary teeth [intronic within ALLC, odds ratio (OR) 0.85, effect allele frequency (EAF) 0.60, P 4.13e-8] and rs7738851-A (intronic within NEDD9, OR 1.28, EAF 0.85, P 1.63e-8) for permanent teeth. Consortium-wide estimated heritability of caries was low [h2 of 1% (95% CI: 0%: 7%) and 6% (95% CI 0%: 13%) for primary and permanent dentitions, respectively] compared with corresponding within-study estimates [h2 of 28% (95% CI: 9%: 48%) and 17% (95% CI: 2%: 31%)] or previously published estimates. This study was designed to identify common genetic variants with modest effects which are consistent across different populations. We found few single variants associated with caries status under these assumptions. Phenotypic heterogeneity between cohorts and limited statistical power will have contributed; these findings could also reflect complexity not captured by our study design, such as genetic effects which are conditional on environmental exposure.	 27659635 22507743 24962474 18263651 24556642 22020075 23259602 26442950 26647391 18522740 20562875 1378265 22504419 25597830 18256281 25642630 24792382 24635669 25762173 28070760 25885710 5229577 21940522 16246939 24559672 27754553 19464348 25740856 28064197 25880989 20091798 20616382 25722852 16415888 25612913 29739930 27779626 11852104 25373699 16934741 22860085 27085739 22351765 26662797 27595263 11775787 21385901 12740537 28232699 26261186 27663502 24762786 23470693 3165997 28869591 26283008 26758380 21167468 15521375 28266114 29320767 22665136 16452359 19937461 20082618 20516689 24283279 28450065
29953918	Identification of three novel loci of ALDH2 Gene for Serum Folate levels in a Male Chinese Population by Genome-Wide Association Study.	Serum folate is important in clinical researches and DNA synthesis and methylation. Some loci and genes that are associated with folate levels had been detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), such as rs1801133 in MTHFR and rs1979277 in SHMT1. Nevertheless, only a small part of variants has been clearly identified for serum folate. Hence, we conducted a GWAS to discover new inherited susceptibility and gene-environment interactions on serum folate concentration.

30019117	The coexistence of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a locus can result in distorted calculations of the significance in associating SNPs to disease.	With the recent advance in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) have been extensively reported. Accordingly, the issue of incorrect identification of recombination events that can induce the distortion of multi-allelic or hemizygous variants has received more attention. However, the potential distorted calculation bias or significance of a detected association in a GWAS due to the coexistence of CNVs and SNPs in the same genomic region may remain under-recognized. Here we performed the association study within a congenital scoliosis (CS) cohort whose genetic etiology was recently elucidated as a compound inheritance model, including mostly one rare variant deletion CNV null allele and one common variant non-coding hypomorphic haplotype of the TBX6 gene. We demonstrated that the existence of a deletion in TBX6 led to an overestimation of the contribution of the SNPs on the hypomorphic allele. Furthermore, we generalized a model to explain the calculation bias, or distorted significance calculation for an association study, that can be 'induced' by CNVs at a locus. Meanwhile, overlapping between the disease-associated SNPs from published GWAS and common CNVs (overlap 10%) and pathogenic/likely pathogenic CNVs (overlap 99.69%) was significantly higher than the random distribution (p < 1 × 10	 20482838 26920143 28017472 25470569 20813882 25217958 23685542 22366785 20466091 26495885 17341461 23128226 12169732 27402621 17033965 22604720 22317777 20142258 25259927 26549411 17921354 20059347 28471432 22344220 24316577 19165925 29276006 25363768 21841781 27602560 20079846 20729854 24415654 21587300 26852906 11381028 18776908 19165922 19112455 19166990 28187071 19812545 24759409 21102463 19376486 8198134 15297300 18776910 27535533 25099324 26257172 27309819 26582918 21142928 28054739 23044826 26670213 16327809 16081473 21552272 1677316 17637805 23329113 17701901 22391884 26641089 24088041 20981092 21167468 20360734 27184599 25673413 19571811 24040408 25564734 21844811 15247918 20228709 18714090 25645873 24174537 26924765 19447966 27861764 21293372 15931299 27354352 12596790 25887030 23411593
30046033	PR interval genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 50 loci associated with atrial and atrioventricular electrical activity.	Electrocardiographic PR interval measures atrio-ventricular depolarization and conduction, and abnormal PR interval is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation and heart block. Our genome-wide association study of over 92,000 European-descent individuals identifies 44 PR interval loci (34 novel). Examination of these loci reveals known and previously not-yet-reported biological processes involved in cardiac atrial electrical activity. Genes in these loci are over-represented in cardiac disease processes including heart block and atrial fibrillation. Variants in over half of the 44 loci were associated with atrial or blood transcript expression levels, or were in high linkage disequilibrium with missense variants. Six additional loci were identified either by meta-analysis of ~105,000 African and European-descent individuals and/or by pleiotropic analyses combining PR interval with heart rate, QRS interval, and atrial fibrillation. These findings implicate developmental pathways, and identify transcription factors, ion-channel genes, and cell-junction/cell-signaling proteins in atrio-ventricular conduction, identifying potential targets for drug development.	 18974171 27899567 25642630 17943122 2919564 29050564 28472511 22544366 23139255 24850809 27659466 24013639 23935874 21829371 28794112 28449838 20639392 25055868 20354512 22576172 28416818 18852200 29545482 23583979 19111760 20062060 19561590 18348202 21076409 20062063 24951663 22955828 25035420
30048462	Identification of 613 new loci associated with heel bone mineral density and a polygenic risk score for bone mineral density, osteoporosis and fracture.	Low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to osteoporosis, and is a risk factor for bone fractures, including stress fractures. Using data from UK Biobank, a genome-wide association study identified 1,362 independent SNPs that clustered into 899 loci of which 613 are new. These data were used to train a genetic algorithm using 22,886 SNPs as predictors and showing a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.415. Combining this genetic algorithm with height, weight, age and sex resulted in a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.496. Individuals with low scores (2.2% of total) showed a change in BMD of -1.16 T-score units, an increase in risk for osteoporosis of 17.4 fold and an increase in risk for fracture of 1.87 fold. Genetic predictors could assist in the identification of individuals at risk for osteoporosis or fractures.	 17273893 21224201 28854176 22384356 19419318 28425085 18292978 27821574 10320531 11101266 15068502 23731541 28472463 17414993 18042915 11444090 18165669 21351144 20354512 28146470 16036103 9718201 26527727 22504420 25642633 22222934 10091275 28853307 24430505 22955989 28869591 26367794 12378368 20634204 17701901 19561590 7950721 20008691 8992884 20601685
30053915	Human genetic variants and age are the strongest predictors of humoral immune responses to common pathogens and vaccines.	Humoral immune responses to infectious agents or vaccination vary substantially among individuals, and many of the factors responsible for this variability remain to be defined. Current evidence suggests that human genetic variation influences (i) serum immunoglobulin levels, (ii) seroconversion rates, and (iii) intensity of antigen-specific immune responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of intrinsic (age and sex), environmental, and genetic factors on the variability of humoral response to common pathogens and vaccines.	 23724903 26456283 19200827 17194218 23585874 26553974 23935489 22895189 24725414 23762245 21996708 25293367 26007630 18450852 25722852 4204534 20417416 23652523 24676358 22673310 20110278 21799704 18524433 27694958 25562703 28928442 24531419 29476184 25569265 28628107 23118916 25720438 22728672 24591516 22864923 17701901 23326239 24743097 15809348 19684573 26430804 27548312 20926424 23684009 10870028 25758998 25025336
30054458	Genome-wide association analyses identify 143 risk variants and putative regulatory mechanisms for type 2 diabetes.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a very common disease in humans. Here we conduct a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with ~16 million genetic variants in 62,892 T2D cases and 596,424 controls of European ancestry. We identify 139 common and 4 rare variants associated with T2D, 42 of which (39 common and 3 rare variants) are independent of the known variants. Integration of the gene expression data from blood (n = 14,115 and 2765) with the GWAS results identifies 33 putative functional genes for T2D, 3 of which were targeted by approved drugs. A further integration of DNA methylation (n = 1980) and epigenomic annotation data highlight 3 genes (CAMK1D, TP53INP1, and ATP5G1) with plausible regulatory mechanisms, whereby a genetic variant exerts an effect on T2D through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Our study uncovers additional loci, proposes putative genetic regulatory mechanisms for T2D, and provides evidence of purifying selection for T2D-associated variants.	 22286214 27416945 29500431 29429966 25693563 29335400 29632382 23128226 27402621 29700474 29891976 19833888 27061677 23434541 26467463 16415884 25642630 17943122 28065468 21233399 29412141 26417671 26323059 24830394 24699409 26092716 28193859 24413736 22251874 21670730 20616382 25722852 28506277 27398621 26414676 27604177 25108154 24990607 23520370 27019110 25642633 25211022 26414678 27197206 19812666 24464100 21965303 26140333 10973253 27899670 18372903 22426310 16335791 21167468 27548312 25673413 22955828 29662166 20007922 22885922 28261261 19543373 24411477 28869590 28566273 29022597 25157153

30071075	A genome-wide association study of energy intake and expenditure.	Excessive energy intake or insufficient energy expenditure, which result in energy imbalance, contribute to the development of obesity. Obesity-related genes, such as FTO, are associated with energy traits. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to detect the genetic associations with energy-related traits, including energy intake and energy expenditure, among European-ancestry populations. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide study using pooled GWAS including 12,030 European-ancestry women and 6,743 European-ancestry men to identify genetic variants associated with these two energy traits. We observed a statistically significant genome-wide SNP heritability for energy intake of 6.05% (95%CI = (1.76, 10.34), P = 0.006); the SNP heritability for expenditure was not statistically significantly greater than zero. We discovered three SNPs on chromosome 12q13 near gene ANKRD33 that were genome-wide significantly associated with increased total energy intake among all men. We also identified signals on region 2q22 that were associated with energy expenditure among lean people. Body mass index related SNPs were found to be significantly associated with energy intake and expenditure through SNP set analyses.

To date, several targeted genetic studies on chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) have been performed; however, unbiased genome-wide studies into the genetics of cCSC have not been reported. To discover new genetic loci associated with cCSC and to better understand the causative mechanism of this disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on patients with cCSC.	 11148819 28525563 25439433 28053499 23830046 11340388 24365176 24665005 28671968 28105966 28082374 15870199 25885710 18166410 15019370 9345114 26305533 29190234 28522341 17662099 20172062 27019110 26484571 12620229 26296146 26691988 20930852 28334414 26258848 26026923 24120647 26054645 12882822
30087447	Association of modifiers and other genetic factors explain Marfan syndrome clinical variability.	Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder related to variants in the FBN1 gene. Prognosis is related to aortic risk of dissection following aneurysm. MFS clinical variability is notable, for age of onset as well as severity and number of clinical manifestations. To identify genetic modifiers, we combined genome-wide approaches in 1070 clinically well-characterized FBN1 disease-causing variant carriers: (1) an FBN1 eQTL analysis in 80 fibroblasts of FBN1 stop variant carriers, (2) a linkage analysis, (3) a kinship matrix association study in 14 clinically concordant and discordant sib-pairs, (4) a genome-wide association study and (5) a whole exome sequencing in 98 extreme phenotype samples.Three genetic mechanisms of variability were found. A new genotype/phenotype correlation with an excess of loss-of-cysteine variants (P = 0.004) in severely affected subjects. A second pathogenic event in another thoracic aortic aneurysm gene or the COL4A1 gene (known to be involved in cerebral aneurysm) was found in nine individuals. A polygenic model involving at least nine modifier loci (named gMod-M1-9) was observed through cross-mapping of results. Notably, gMod-M2 which co-localizes with PRKG1, in which activating variants have already been described in thoracic aortic aneurysm, and gMod-M3 co-localized with a metalloprotease (proteins of extra-cellular matrix regulation) cluster. Our results represent a major advance in understanding the complex genetic architecture of MFS and provide the first steps toward prediction of clinical evolution.	 22041029 25173340 17341461 25101912 12184808 8723076 26787436 17921354 18344981 17701892 25431634 24791902 20644199 17572673 25652400 22138362 20591885 25307299 23910461 27582083 18310266 11731797 19117906 17701901 2773795 23269371 8506302 21658581 16675726 20601685 19543373 22706312 25954001

30093639	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple new loci associated with Ewing sarcoma susceptibility.	Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric cancer characterized by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion. We performed a genome-wide association study of 733 EWS cases and 1346 unaffected individuals of European ancestry. Our study replicates previously reported susceptibility loci at 1p36.22, 10q21.3 and 15q15.1, and identifies new loci at 6p25.1, 20p11.22 and 20p11.23. Effect estimates exhibit odds ratios in excess of 1.7, which is high for cancer GWAS, and striking in light of the rarity of EWS cases in familial cancer syndromes. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify candidate genes at 6p25.1 (RREB1) and 20p11.23 (KIZ). The 20p11.22 locus is near NKX2-2, a highly overexpressed gene in EWS. Interestingly, most loci reside near GGAA repeat sequences and may disrupt binding of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein. The high locus to case discovery ratio from 733 EWS cases suggests a genetic architecture in which moderate risk SNPs constitute a significant fraction of risk.	 9367691 19305498 26432245 28195142 14136345 21212061 22388286 4192117 26214589 17106438 28844694 18596976 22138821 16980960 21559395 29059430 18056173 17438102 16697960 18626011 26503584 22327514 18798982 25010205 4191272 23715323 26139635 25186949 18370092 8022439 20543858 17701901 17482132 6104072 25223734 19364948 1522903 6704922 16284200 4189632 23539302 19543373 24429628 6877319 19548262 12925520

30102696	A genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for biliary atresia on 2p16.1 within the gene EFEMP1.	Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare pediatric cholangiopathy characterized by fibrosclerosing obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventual liver failure. The etiology of BA remains unknown, although environmental, inflammatory, infectious, and genetic risk factors have been proposed. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a European-American cohort of 343 isolated BA patients and 1716 controls to identify genetic loci associated with BA. A second GWAS was performed in an independent European-American cohort of 156 patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies and 212 controls to confirm the identified candidate BA-associated SNPs. Meta-analysis revealed three genome-wide significant BA-associated SNPs on 2p16.1 (rs10865291, rs6761893, and rs727878; P < 5 ×10-8), located within the fifth intron of the EFEMP1 gene, which encodes a secreted extracellular protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. RNA expression analysis showed an increase in EFEMP1 transcripts from human liver specimens isolated from patients with either BA or other cholestatic diseases when compared to normal control liver samples. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that EFEMP1 is expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in liver specimens from patients with BA and other cholestatic diseases, but it is absent from cholangiocytes in normal control liver samples. Efemp1 transcripts had higher expression in cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts as compared with other cell types in normal rat liver. The identification of a novel BA-associated locus, and implication of EFEMP1 as a new BA candidate susceptibility gene, could provide new insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying this severe pediatric disorder.	 17872905 24929828 9041292 3351711 22384356 23151860 2334368 23336978 6676639 19914515 28374850 7595823 11594943 26379158 19804359 1605254 10369267 25285724 12861525 26686553 17572673 27526058 8372680 1823220 19457876 22106076 9742491 18984465 25518859 20616382 19756986 20460270 23703680 23921155 18376248 22781395 4824812 18976480 25765999 24104524 23304557 29604222 16872500 17666404 11232184 28053046 22118303 3232705 17725591 11241420 22665268 12778127 20927779 20634204 6693074 17701901 18391952 16385258 24646999 25823021 24493287 19713864 28710035 29727686 19189051 23328207

30108127	A Large Multiethnic Genome-Wide Association Study of Adult Body Mass Index Identifies Novel Loci.	Body mass index (BMI), a proxy measure for obesity, is determined by both environmental (including ethnicity, age, and sex) and genetic factors, with > 400 BMI-associated loci identified to date. However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of BMI-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GERA, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits (GIANT) consortium combined with the UK Biobank (UKB), followed by GWAS in GERA combined with GIANT, with replication in the UKB.

30113228	Ancestry and genetic associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants is a common and often severe lung disease with long-term sequelae. A genetic component is suspected but not fully defined. We performed an ancestry and genome-wide association study to identify variants, genes, and pathways associated with survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 387 high-risk infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide in the Trial of Late Surfactant study. Global African genetic ancestry was associated with increased survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia among infants of maternal self-reported Hispanic white race/ethnicity [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, P = 0.01]. Admixture mapping found suggestive outcome associations with local African ancestry at chromosome bands 18q21 and 10q22 among infants of maternal self-reported African-American race/ethnicity. For all infants, the top individual variant identified was within the intron of NBL1, which is expressed in midtrimester lung and is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins ( rs372271081 , OR = 0.17, P = 7.4 × 10	
30116032	Genetics of suicide attempts in individuals with and without mental disorders: a population-based genome-wide association study.	Family studies have shown an aggregation of suicidal behavior in families. Yet, molecular studies are needed to identify loci accounting for genetic heritability. We conducted a genome-wide association study and estimated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) heritability for a suicide attempt. In a case-cohort study, national data on all individuals born in Denmark after 1981 and diagnosed with severe mental disorders prior to 2013 (n = 57,377) and individuals from the general population (n = 30,000) were obtained. After quality control, the sample consisted of 6024 cases with an incidence of suicide attempt and 44,240 controls with no record of a suicide attempt.

30120420	Identification of novel loci associated with infant cognitive ability.	It is believed that genetic factors play a large role in the development of many cognitive and neurological processes; however, epidemiological evidence for the genetic basis of childhood neurodevelopment is very limited. Identification of the genetic polymorphisms associated with early-stage neurodevelopment will help elucidate biological mechanisms involved in neuro-behavior and provide a better understanding of the developing brain. To search for such variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for infant mental and motor ability at two years of age with mothers and children recruited from cohorts in Bangladesh and Mexico. Infant ability was assessed using mental and motor composite scores calculated with country-specific versions of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.

Evidence suggests that the immune system in adults not only responds to environmental stimulation but is also under strong genetic control.	 21810230 19119429 20705131 17804539 24842698 25594173 25628336 19157572 11969335 24734032 22982535 27093065 14517301 26822608 24916648 17900986 27814507 28180029 28238116 25448709 25162540 21376301 24074872 25880423 27989323 8801636 20181892 20015486 28607458 27023227 25628644 26903267 24721987 24904596 26392128 24204716 26880766 22328738 26432246 27217154 25772697 20634204 17701901 24366406 25147954 18348202 28455196 21641581 21167468 24751956 25673413 28235828 27893896 29155950 21134442 17913903 19840550 23453885 25939698 23419545
30150663	GWAS of lifetime cannabis use reveals new risk loci, genetic overlap with psychiatric traits, and a causal influence of schizophrenia.	Cannabis use is a heritable trait that has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. In the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for lifetime cannabis use to date (N = 184,765), we identified eight genome-wide significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in six regions. All measured genetic variants combined explained 11% of the variance. Gene-based tests revealed 35 significant genes in 16 regions, and S-PrediXcan analyses showed that 21 genes had different expression levels for cannabis users versus nonusers. The strongest finding across the different analyses was CADM2, which has been associated with substance use and risk-taking. Significant genetic correlations were found with 14 of 25 tested substance use and mental health-related traits, including smoking, alcohol use, schizophrenia and risk-taking. Mendelian randomization analysis showed evidence for a causal positive influence of schizophrenia risk on cannabis use. Overall, our study provides new insights into the etiology of cannabis use and its relation with mental health.

30181573	Genetics of serum urate concentrations and gout in a high-risk population, patients with chronic kidney disease.	We evaluated genetics of hyperuricemia and gout, their interaction with kidney function and medication intake in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of urate and gout were performed in 4941 CKD patients in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study. Effect estimates of 26 known urate-associated population-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined. Interactions of urate-associated variants with urate-altering medications and clinical characteristics of gout were evaluated. Genome-wide significant associations with serum urate and gout were identified for known loci at SLC2A9 and ABCG2, but not for novel loci. Effects of the 26 known SNPs were of similar magnitude in CKD patients compared to population-based individuals, except for SNPs at ABCG2 that showed greater effects in CKD. Gene-medication interactions were not significant when accounting for multiple testing. Associations with gout in specific joints were significant for SLC2A9 rs12498742 in wrists and midfoot joints. Known genetic variants in SLC2A9 and ABCG2 were associated with urate and gout in a CKD cohort, with effect sizes for ABCG2 significantly greater in CKD compared to the general population. CKD patients are at high risk of gout due to reduced kidney function, diuretics intake and genetic predisposition, making treatment to target challenging.	 26209544 15014182 21123328 21085122 23543594 17698728 26150127 20368174 27274832 27571712 25395390 26989110 22820512 15094272 25667207 27272587 27590182 20517342 22753387 19503597 22132962 18327256 23089270 18834626 24718961 23263486 22348008 18946066 22420403 17701901 18327257 24940678 23269371 21768215 23727165 23934311 25271006 20601685 25874373 20739424 21862458 17997608 23929090

30181555	Genetics of self-reported risk-taking behaviour, trans-ethnic consistency and relevance to brain gene expression.	Risk-taking behaviour is an important component of several psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previously, two genetic loci have been associated with self-reported risk taking and significant genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders was identified within a subsample of UK Biobank. Using the white British participants of the full UK Biobank cohort (n = 83,677 risk takers versus 244,662 controls) for our primary analysis, we conducted a genome-wide association study of self-reported risk-taking behaviour. In secondary analyses, we assessed sex-specific effects, trans-ethnic heterogeneity and genetic overlap with psychiatric traits. We also investigated the impact of risk-taking-associated SNPs on both gene expression and structural brain imaging. We identified 10 independent loci for risk-taking behaviour, of which eight were novel and two replicated previous findings. In addition, we found two further sex-specific risk-taking loci. There were strong positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Index genetic variants demonstrated effects generally consistent with the discovery analysis in individuals of non-British White, South Asian, African-Caribbean or mixed ethnicity. Polygenic risk scores comprising alleles associated with increased risk taking were associated with lower white matter integrity. Genotype-specific expression pattern analyses highlighted DPYSL5, CGREF1 and C15orf59 as plausible candidate genes. Overall, our findings substantially advance our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, including the possibility of sex-specific contributions, and reveal consistency across ethnicities. We further highlight several putative novel candidate genes, which may mediate these genetic effects.	 26717959 27992416 25644384 27643430 21979382 25826379 17344389 22384356 28991256 28034722 26235432 27738995 29391395 23963117 22285654 25550326 25869804 27668389 16251987 29463470 27089180 27126046 25088364 26849114 9799106 19707512 28795158 20616382 27158905 27892543 30050107 23894747 26414676 26198764 28983511 27100081 26022276 23715323 19571808 22589738 27225129 28783973 29132412 21991301 28657960 22031444 23726511 19473726 17701901 23269371 25673412 21289187 28937693 17510913 20562413 28892062 27609886 20835237 12941785 28540026 22693341 27046643
30185882	Genetic Determinants of Telomere Length in African American Youth.	Telomere length (TL) is associated with numerous disease states and is affected by genetic and environmental factors. However, TL has been mostly studied in adult populations of European or Asian ancestry. These studies have identified 34 TL-associated genetic variants recently used as genetic proxies for TL. The generalizability of these associations to pediatric populations and racially diverse populations, specifically of African ancestry, remains unclear. Furthermore, six novel variants associated with TL in a population of European children have been identified but not validated. We measured TL from whole blood samples of 492 healthy African American youth (children and adolescents between 8 and 20 years old) and performed the first genome-wide association study of TL in this population. We were unable to replicate neither the 34 reported genetic associations found in adults nor the six genetic associations found in European children. However, we discovered a novel genome-wide significant association between TL and rs1483898 on chromosome 14. Our results underscore the importance of examining genetic associations with TL in diverse pediatric populations such as African Americans.	 23900074 25644736 28118639 29335375 24904205 26432245 21573004 23454763 24711381 9843981 15627237 24050698 25770094 23555274 20075150 20860686 23750510 20007561 24465473 26785477 25681203 12373622 28407508 26936823 23392439 25641522 23601089 19359265 21030466 22901253 24478790 25722852 29335377 22232671 24686071 29335374 11328886 21369534 28486341 20811451 18462274 12519996 18976480 27694958 27008888 27566956 27929092 23001564 24795349 7977349 19915151 20634204 23535734 23880207 29049509 17024208 21878343 21577215 21804549 9600234 20421499 19648217 22472277 29151059 21903159 19056834 21460395 16080560 25064373 12000852
30220432	Genetic Association of Albuminuria with Cardiometabolic Disease and Blood Pressure.	Excretion of albumin in urine, or albuminuria, is associated with the development of multiple cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, whether pathways leading to albuminuria are causal for cardiometabolic diseases is unclear. We addressed this question using a Mendelian randomization framework in the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort. We first performed a genome-wide association study for albuminuria in 382,500 individuals and identified 32 new albuminuria loci. We constructed albuminuria genetic risk scores and tested for association with cardiometabolic diseases.

30194396	Variants associating with uterine leiomyoma highlight genetic background shared by various cancers and hormone-related traits.	Uterine leiomyomas are common benign tumors of the myometrium. We performed a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies of leiomyoma in European women (16,595 cases and 523,330 controls), uncovering 21 variants at 16 loci that associate with the disease. Five variants were previously reported to confer risk of various malignant or benign tumors (rs78378222 in TP53, rs10069690 in TERT, rs1800057 and rs1801516 in ATM, and rs7907606 at OBFC1) and four signals are located at established risk loci for hormone-related traits (endometriosis and breast cancer) at 1q36.12 (CDC42/WNT4), 2p25.1 (GREB1), 20p12.3 (MCM8), and 6q26.2 (SYNE1/ESR1). Polygenic score for leiomyoma, computed using UKB data, is significantly correlated with risk of cancer in the Icelandic population. Functional annotation suggests that the non-coding risk variants affect multiple genes, including ESR1. Our results provide insights into the genetic background of leiomyoma that are shared by other benign and malignant tumors and highlight the role of hormones in leiomyoma growth.	 27197291 18644889 23571737 26733130 19448621 28195142 28653894 19165921 27135401 22974093 26854916 29767749 21946351 26924986 19536092 25807286 25642630 25027329 19921989 15280931 28836065 8635633 24634504 20661439 28056765 28537267 28346442 26430803 26928228 24292274 18372219 19448622 27168235 27539887 26646793 19801982 29059683 22504420 26098866 23644456 21460842 21983787 28604730 27851967 26849466 23604678 25223781 27443449 20421499 22426310 12548202 23136140 26237428 26423011 22037553 28598434 11099869 25581431 28096410 16574953

30213928	Identification of multiple risk loci and regulatory mechanisms influencing susceptibility to multiple myeloma.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of susceptibility to multiple myeloma (MM), but much of the heritability remains unexplained. We report a new GWAS, a meta-analysis with previous GWAS and a replication series, totalling 9974 MM cases and 247,556 controls of European ancestry. Collectively, these data provide evidence for six new MM risk loci, bringing the total number to 23. Integration of information from gene expression, epigenetic profiling and in situ Hi-C data for the 23 risk loci implicate disruption of developmental transcriptional regulators as a basis of MM susceptibility, compatible with altered B-cell differentiation as a key mechanism. Dysregulation of autophagy/apoptosis and cell cycle signalling feature as recurrently perturbed pathways. Our findings provide further insight into the biological basis of MM.	 27882933 16424087 17550853 14512299 19363484 17668372 21085122 25887733 23502783 25237182 27041574 16753294 27306882 30104760 19587704 20193048 17572673 23619786 20616218 24292274 23810536 28393830 15482850 26578737 28903037 26007630 23001124 15827134 22996653 27863955 22120009 8801636 22806891 23455638 27863249 27363682 18641171 27019110 26728187 27239034 21614091 19456850 29296704 28530675 20418889 18514565 23955597 16228001 26368830 27528712 26208354 20981092 23281567 21167468 19028483 22373907 12076535 27697780 19543373 20220069 27587788

30263053	Genome-wide association study for multiple phenotype analysis.	Genome-wide association studies often collect multiple phenotypes for complex diseases. Multivariate joint analyses have higher power to detect genetic variants compared with the marginal analysis of each phenotype and are also able to identify loci with pleiotropic effects. We extend the unified score-based association test to incorporate family structure, apply different approaches to analyze multiple traits in GAW20 real samples, and compare the results. Through simulation studies, we confirm that the Type I error rate of the pedigree-based unified score association test is appropriately controlled. In marginalanalysis of triglyceride levels, we found 1 subgenome-wide significant variant on chromosome 6. Joint analyses identified several suggestive genome-wide significant signals, with the pedigree-based unified score association test yielding the greatest number of significant results.	 26486473 19170135 24748889 24531419 21647556 23251661 26638693 22706312
30223776	Bivariate genome-wide association analysis strengthens the role of bitter receptor clusters on chromosomes 7 and 12 in human bitter taste.	Human perception of bitter substances is partially genetically determined. Previously we discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the cluster of bitter taste receptor genes on chromosome 12 that accounts for 5.8% of the variance in the perceived intensity rating of quinine, and we strengthened the classic association between TAS2R38 genotype and the bitterness of propylthiouracil (PROP). Here we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a 40% larger sample (n = 1999) together with a bivariate approach to detect previously unidentified common variants with small effects on bitter perception.	 27226572 22643728 28118781 12624758 16782140 10761935 24141950 23966204 26493384 9402622 21672920 20675712 27506221 25056061 10205283 25266125 22064851 16979544 22977065 26911590 10669650 26931105 16527870 11521845 22955616 10766242 29292387 21036327 26024668 22132133 26562612 7878083 26274327 10761934 25898129 26014426 20980355 26484571 24531419 1290451 25338720 19812666 20634204 11293722 23861737 21427758 2753352 24743097 14997420 21994393 25673413 14249066 26406243 20022913 23041624
30324795	Genetic determinants of glucose levels in pregnancy: genetic risk scores analysis and GWAS in the Norwegian STORK cohort.	Objective Hyperglycaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in mother and child, but the genetic aetiology is scarcely studied. Our aims were to (1) assess the overlapping genetic aetiology between the pregnant and non-pregnant population and (2) assess the importance of genome-wide polygenic contributions to glucose traits during pregnancy, by exploring whether genetic risk scores (GRSs) for fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose (2hG), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and BMI in non-pregnant individuals were associated with glucose measures in pregnant women. Methods We genotyped 529 Norwegian pregnant women and constructed GRS from known genome-wide significant variants and SNPs weakly associated (p > 5 × 10-8) with FG, 2hG, BMI and T2D from external genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined the association between these scores and glucose measures at gestational weeks 14-16 and 30-32. We also performed GWAS of FG, 2hG and shape information from the glucose curve during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Results GRSFG explained similar variance during pregnancy as in the non-pregnant population (~5%). GRSBMI and GRST2D explained up to 1.3% of the variation in the glucose traits in pregnancy. If we included variants more weakly associated with these traits, GRS2hG and GRST2D explained up to 2.4% of the variation in the glucose traits in pregnancy, highlighting the importance of polygenic contributions. Conclusions Our results suggest overlap in the genetic aetiology of FG in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals. This was less apparent with 2hG, suggesting potential differences in postprandial glucose metabolism inside and outside of pregnancy.	
30242048	Genomic Analyses of Visual Cognition: Perceptual Rivalry and Top-Down Control.	Visual cognition in humans has traditionally been studied with cognitive behavioral methods and brain imaging, but much less with genetic methods. Perceptual rivalry, an important phenomenon in visual cognition, is the spontaneous perceptual alternation that occurs between two distinct interpretations of a physically constant visual stimulus (e.g., binocular rivalry stimuli) or a perceptually ambiguous stimulus (e.g., the Necker cube). The switching rate varies dramatically across individuals and can be voluntarily modulated by observers. Here, we adopted a genomic approach to systematically investigate the genetics underlying binocular rivalry, Necker cube rivalry and voluntary modulation of Necker cube rivalry in young Chinese adults (

Excessive sodium intake is a global risk factor for hypertension. Sodium effects on blood pressure vary from person to person; hence, high-risk group targeting based on personal genetic information can play a complementary role to ongoing population preventive approaches to reduce sodium consumption. To identify genetic factors that modulate sodium effects on blood pressure, we conducted a population-based genome-wide interaction analysis in 8,768 Japanese subjects, which was >3 times larger than a similar previous study. We tested 7,135,436 polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, and loci that met suggestive significance were further examined in an independent replication cohort. We found that an interaction between a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus and daily sodium consumption was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure in both discovery and replication cohorts under the recessive model. Further statistical analysis of rs8022678, the sentinel variant of the 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus, showed that differences in mean systolic blood pressure between high and low sodium consumption subgroups were 5.9 mm Hg (P = 8.8 × 10	 17998389 16809611 6618640 11315092 13160264 21058046 629267 28034966 17308084 29619235 29263827 22138821 15055256 24165912 27374138 19812606 1987013 27571263 16926283 20425154 29170429 25398084 25722852 22068710 15788708 27271309 11788432 17485599 22068335 23558162 29144825 17283440 26139635 22450536 21149826 8225535 28951542 17283861 8901834 26378682 11850766 28392754 21254217 19110538 29503383 19351697
30319691	Genome-Wide Association and Mechanistic Studies Indicate That Immune Response Contributes to Alzheimer's Disease Development.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Although genome-wide association study (GWAS) have reported hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes linked to AD, the mechanisms about how these SNPs modulate the development of AD remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed GWAS for three traits in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and one clinical trait in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our analysis identified five most significant AD related SNPs (FDR < 0.05) within or proximal to APOE, APOC1, and TOMM40. One of the SNPs was co-inherited with APOE allele 4, which is the most important genetic risk factor for AD. Three of the five SNPs were located in promoter or enhancer regions, and transcription factor (TF) binding affinity calculations showed dramatic changes (| Log2FC| > 2) of three TFs (PLAG1, RREB1, and ZBTB33) for two motifs containing SNPs rs2075650 and rs157580. In addition, our GWAS showed that both rs2075650 and rs157580 were significantly associated with the poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) gene (FDR < 0.25), which is involved in spreading of herpes simplex virus (HSV). The altered regulation of PVRL2 may increase the susceptibility AD patients to HSV and other virus infections of the brain. Our work suggests that AD is a type of immune disorder driven by viral or microbial infections of the brain during aging.	 29140473 9343467 17332914 26560146 19296504 20674092 28432014 22064851 12456712 17980964 27225182 12045153 19853650 18394891 9530504 28641921 29937276 17101890 10207085 19734902 25036040 18339640 21756998 23180783 9845526 25605792 11137759 15992827 24335146 10072051 28602351 20451875 23193258 9657005 14583743 17998437 15056211 17012293 25575131 23296339 15592137 22492648 20955934 26868820 18487848 25217293 21156047

30248107	Genome-wide association studies and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing identify regulatory variants influencing eyebrow thickness in humans.	Hair plays an important role in primates and is clearly subject to adaptive selection. While humans have lost most facial hair, eyebrows are a notable exception. Eyebrow thickness is heritable and widely believed to be subject to sexual selection. Nevertheless, few genomic studies have explored its genetic basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan for eyebrow thickness in 2961 Han Chinese. We identified two new loci of genome-wide significance, at 3q26.33 near SOX2 (rs1345417: P = 6.51×10(-10)) and at 5q13.2 near FOXD1 (rs12651896: P = 1.73×10(-8)). We further replicated our findings in the Uyghurs, a population from China characterized by East Asian-European admixture (N = 721), the CANDELA cohort from five Latin American countries (N = 2301), and the Rotterdam Study cohort of Dutch Europeans (N = 4411). A meta-analysis combining the full GWAS results from the three cohorts of full or partial Asian descent (Han Chinese, Uyghur and Latin Americans, N = 5983) highlighted a third signal of genome-wide significance at 2q12.3 (rs1866188: P = 5.81×10(-11)) near EDAR. We performed fine-mapping and prioritized four variants for further experimental verification. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provided evidence that rs1345417 and rs12651896 affect the transcriptional activity of the nearby SOX2 and FOXD1 genes, which are both involved in hair development. Finally, suitable statistical analyses revealed that none of the associated variants showed clear signals of selection in any of the populations tested. Contrary to popular speculation, we found no evidence that eyebrow thickness is subject to strong selective pressure.	 25102153 25693563 27337980 23731540 16862161 17571346 17235461 26463656 22138821 24880339 24037378 22064851 12729380 22307276 26366552 23185437 1833235 23698366 23793515 25357204 26189819 21565292 19119414 26061380 19561607 16024819 27153496 22402612 20616382 20056855 16494531 20686566 22792070 26603699 26615191 17312534 21152010 23715323 19570815 25075903 24213634 22992803 21058334 26301843 23415220 26926045 23153495 24487276 20634204 2071943 28017375 17701901 26256211 18844710 21167468 20463881 22955828 21533074 27588450 20335885 27487801 19543373 26386597
30363675	Using Adipose Measures from Health Care Provider-Based Imaging Data for Discovery.	The location and type of adipose tissue is an important factor in metabolic syndrome. A database of picture archiving and communication system (PACS) derived abdominal computerized tomography (CT) images from a large health care provider, Geisinger, was used for large-scale research of the relationship of volume of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) with obesity-related diseases and clinical laboratory measures. Using a "greedy snake" algorithm and 2,545 CT images from the Geisinger PACS, we measured levels of VAT, SAT, total adipose tissue (TAT), and adipose ratio volumes. Sex-combined and sex-stratified association testing was done between adipose measures and 1,233 disease diagnoses and 37 clinical laboratory measures. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for adipose measures was also performed. SAT was strongly associated with obesity and morbid obesity. VAT levels were strongly associated with type 2 diabetes-related diagnoses (	 14694212 17823430 21905811 27462403 16421348 29079728 6437507 15277390 24896249 24316577 3924217 8044196 4043554 20686565 26480920 3181112 25390016 17316295 16470013 20339536 24931982 20935629 1877502 12079843 26866580 27535653 17694296 22589738 8141087 6426576 2706220 17701901 15298351 23388002 21792326 20706689 14724659 8622609
30261039	Genome-wide meta-analysis of 158,000 individuals of European ancestry identifies three loci associated with chronic back pain.	Back pain is the #1 cause of years lived with disability worldwide, yet surprisingly little is known regarding the biology underlying this symptom. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CBP). Adults of European ancestry were included from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and from the UK Biobank interim data release. CBP cases were defined as those reporting back pain present for ≥3-6 months; non-cases were included as comparisons ("controls"). Each cohort conducted genotyping using commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GWAS used logistic regression models with additive genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. The threshold for genome-wide significance in the fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was p<5×10(-8). Suggestive (p<5×10(-7)) and genome-wide significant (p<5×10(-8)) variants were carried forward for replication or further investigation in the remaining UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample. The discovery sample comprised 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 CBP cases. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p = 7.2×10(-10)). This was subsequently replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p = 5.3×10(-11)), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (OR 1.07, p = 4.5×10(-19)). We found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p = 4.4×10(-13)), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC (OR 0.97, p = 2.4×10(-10)). In this first reported meta-analysis of GWAS for CBP, we identified and replicated a genetic locus associated with CBP (SOX5). We also identified 2 other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis (CCDC26/GSDMC and DCC).	 29184056 28921656 25693563 26432245 19790135 23973131 28436462 24462537 23989986 20031568 25985137 28223688 25642630 22956599 28855172 17335977 21091209 23752797 26078308 23147891 27616674 21952189 26150426 27686527 22588384 25679471 9250186 23690249 22993228 22821350 26414676 11702786 23335362 27696742 20739918 24752913 29846171 9154024 26414678 20371789 26487293 22763110 25881791 27663502 24762786 20869000 22751038 22955989 24487276 16595438 27494321 27794503 24950669 29686387 24928840 20112360 24665116 27548312 12571105 27521520 26482371 22612913 22373907 21068099 24757145 21593339 28245592 27771362 26746145 22396742 25954001 23405082 27089181
30267110	Identification of the TIFAB Gene as a Susceptibility Locus for Coronary Artery Aneurysm in Patients with Kawasaki Disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. KD is often complicated by coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs), which develop in about 20-25% of untreated children and 3-5% of children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. To identify the risk loci for CAA susceptibility in patients with KD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients) and a new replication study in an independent sample set (713 KD patients) by grouping KD patients without CAA (control) versus KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter ≥ 5 mm) (case). Among 44 candidate single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the initial GWAS data (33 cases vs. 215 controls), a SNP (rs899162) located 7 kb upstream of the TIFAB gene on chromosome five was replicated in an independent sample (12 cases vs. 532 controls). In the combined analysis (45 cases vs. 747 controls), the SNP (rs899162) showed a highly significant association with CAA formation (diameter ≥ 5 mm) in patients with KD (odds ratio = 3.20, 95% confidence interval = 2.02-5.05, P	
30279459	Brain scans from 21,297 individuals reveal the genetic architecture of hippocampal subfield volumes.	The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure, comprising histologically distinguishable subfields. These subfields are differentially involved in memory consolidation, spatial navigation and pattern separation, complex functions often impaired in individuals with brain disorders characterized by reduced hippocampal volume, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Given the structural and functional heterogeneity of the hippocampal formation, we sought to characterize the subfields' genetic architecture. T1-weighted brain scans (n = 21,297, 16 cohorts) were processed with the hippocampal subfields algorithm in FreeSurfer v6.0. We ran a genome-wide association analysis on each subfield, co-varying for whole hippocampal volume. We further calculated the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of 12 subfields, as well as their genetic correlation with each other, with other structural brain features and with AD and schizophrenia. All outcome measures were corrected for age, sex and intracranial volume. We found 15 unique genome-wide significant loci across six subfields, of which eight had not been previously linked to the hippocampus. Top SNPs were mapped to genes associated with neuronal differentiation, locomotor behaviour, schizophrenia and AD. The volumes of all the subfields were estimated to be heritable (h2 from 0.14 to 0.27, all p < 1 × 10	
30281099	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies BARX1 and EML4-MTA3 as new loci associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.	Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder of young infants with a population incidence of ∼2/1000 live births, caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter smooth muscle. Reported genetic loci associated with IHPS explain only a minor proportion of IHPS risk. To identify new risk loci, we carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis on 1395 surgery-confirmed cases and 4438 controls, with replication in a set of 2427 cases and 2524 controls. We identified and replicated six independent genomic loci associated with IHPS risk at genome wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8), including novel associations with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One of these SNPs, rs6736913 [odds ratio (OR) = 2.32; P = 3.0 × 10-15], is a low frequency missense variant in EML4 at 2p21. The second SNP, rs1933683 (OR = 1.34; P = 3.1 × 10-9) is 1 kb downstream of BARX1 at 9q22.32, an essential gene for stomach formation in embryogenesis. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis method, we estimated the IHPS SNP heritability to be 30%, and using the linkage disequilibrium score regression method, we found support for a previously reported genetic correlation of IHPS with lipid metabolism. By combining the largest collection of IHPS cases to date (3822 cases), with results generalized across populations of different ancestry, we elucidate novel mechanistic avenues of IHPS disease architecture.	
30285260	Genome-Wide Association Study Detected Novel Susceptibility Genes for Schizophrenia and Shared Trans-Populations/Diseases Genetic Effect.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >100 susceptibility loci for schizophrenia (SCZ) and demonstrated that SCZ is a polygenic disorder determined by numerous genetic variants but with small effect size. We conducted a GWAS in the Japanese (JPN) population (a) to detect novel SCZ-susceptibility genes and (b) to examine the shared genetic risk of SCZ across (East Asian [EAS] and European [EUR]) populations and/or that of trans-diseases (SCZ, bipolar disorder [BD], and major depressive disorder [MDD]) within EAS and between EAS and EUR (trans-diseases/populations). Among the discovery GWAS subjects (JPN-SCZ GWAS: 1940 SCZ cases and 7408 controls) and replication dataset (4071 SCZ cases and 54479 controls), both comprising JPN populations, 3 novel susceptibility loci for SCZ were identified: SPHKAP (Pbest = 4.1 × 10-10), SLC38A3 (Pbest = 5.7 × 10-10), and CABP1-ACADS (Pbest = 9.8 × 10-9). Subsequent meta-analysis between our samples and those of the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium (PGC; EUR samples) and another study detected 12 additional susceptibility loci. Polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction revealed a shared genetic risk of SCZ across populations (Pbest = 4.0 × 10-11) and between SCZ and BD in the JPN population (P ~ 10-40); however, a lower variance-explained was noted between JPN-SCZ GWAS and PGC-BD or MDD within/across populations. Genetic correlation analysis supported the PRS results; the genetic correlation between JPN-SCZ and PGC-SCZ was ρ = 0.58, whereas a similar/lower correlation was observed between the trans-diseases (JPN-SCZ vs JPN-BD/EAS-MDD, rg = 0.56/0.29) or trans-diseases/populations (JPN-SCZ vs PGC-BD/MDD, ρ = 0.38/0.12). In conclusion, (a) Fifteen novel loci are possible susceptibility genes for SCZ and (b) SCZ "risk" effect is shared with other psychiatric disorders even across populations.	
30299488	Genome-Wide Association Study of Susceptibility Loci for Radiation-Induced Brain Injury.	Radiation-induced brain injury is a nonnegligible issue in the management of cancer patients treated by partial or whole brain irradiation. In particular, temporal lobe injury (TLI), a deleterious late complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, greatly affects the long-term life quality of these patients. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with radiation toxicity, genetic variants contributing to the radiation-induced brain injury have not yet been assessed.

30306274	Genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism in UK Biobank demonstrate a shared role for myopia susceptibility loci.	Previous studies have suggested that naturally occurring genetic variation contributes to the risk of astigmatism. The purpose of this investigation was to identify genetic markers associated with corneal and refractive astigmatism in a large-scale European ancestry cohort (UK Biobank) who underwent keratometry and autorefraction at an assessment centre. Genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism were performed in individuals of European ancestry (N = 86,335 and 88,005 respectively), with the mean corneal astigmatism or refractive astigmatism in fellow eyes analysed as a quantitative trait (dependent variable). Genetic correlation between the two traits was calculated using LD Score regression. Gene-based and gene-set tests were carried out using MAGMA. Single marker-based association tests for corneal astigmatism identified four genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 × 10	 24144296 9718344 16199517 25826379 14687201 29422769 25367360 16862161 24473328 22384356 23468642 26367797 23620424 29700474 19430327 25128561 27018471 25642630 14747763 19933197 21552263 17177660 22685421 18319743 25885710 27020472 25260699 18695106 26430771 25722852 21376301 17065484 12107410 14985292 23396134 29892013 26414676 24553384 27643537 15812169 25642633 23401653 11328732 27182965 23322567 16877283 17197519 27269582 25683123 29808027 20634204 22969067 28530675 17701901 27899670 26691988 16209714 27070863 22426310 22144915 25585855 23637621 21167468 25558465 27548312 28823075 20463881 26423011 19619260 29265474 19895722 24718290 11855950 18252221 26019481 27046643
30305740	Genome-wide association studies of brain imaging phenotypes in UK Biobank.	The genetic architecture of brain structure and function is largely unknown. To investigate this, we carried out genome-wide association studies of 3,144 functional and structural brain imaging phenotypes from UK Biobank (discovery dataset 8,428 subjects). Here we show that many of these phenotypes are heritable. We identify 148 clusters of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that replicate at P < 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity.

In this paper, we aim at discovering genetic factors of psoriasis through searching for statistically significant SNP-SNP interactions exhaustively from two real psoriasis genome-wide association study datasets (phs000019.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1) downloaded from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. To deal with the enormous search space, our search algorithm is accelerated with eight biological plausible interaction patterns and a pre-computed look-up table. After our search, we have discovered several SNPs having a stronger association to psoriasis when they are in combination with another SNP and these combinations may be non-linear interactions. Among the top 20 SNP-SNP interactions being found in terms of pairwise p-value and improvement metric value, we have discovered 27 novel potential psoriasis-associated SNPs where most of them are reported to be eQTLs of a number of known psoriasis-associated genes. On the other hand, we have inferred a gene network after selecting the top 10000 SNP-SNP interactions in terms of improvement metric value and we have discovered a novel long distance interaction between XXbac-BPG154L12.4 and RNU6-283P which is not a long distance haplotype and may be a new discovery. Finally, our experiments with the synthetic datasets have shown that our pre-computed look-up table technique can significantly speed up the search process.	 20502444 15848982 23819779 15716906 12930300 21085122 17314032 23128226 16965413 25399422 23574549 22931917 17878941 27073425 28411841 16381927 18940858 19169254 25264125 26811024 19262574 9798343 29259305 27571263 18369459 2041889 15009387 24270849 17340018 21214922 26626624 26363021 11875053 24803509 19680446 22125590 25182136 26442103 21051598 25403525 20885795 21810746 28449694 15708881 19164747 29329369 21471009 23252691 16788615 21509048 11390038 21372087 23626757 29674565 12653732 15140030 26108231 21623003 11169245 21743469 20953190 25422463 25200660 20053841 12472658 22182809 14681466 24487276 17701901 16642438 19169253 26215033 25241224 22914738 25233071 3735281 6559061 28961251 27980695
30317457	Genome-wide association study of primary open-angle glaucoma in continental and admixed African populations.	Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex disease with a major genetic contribution. Its prevalence varies greatly among ethnic groups, and is up to five times more frequent in black African populations compared to Europeans. So far, worldwide efforts to elucidate the genetic complexity of POAG in African populations has been limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1113 POAG cases and 1826 controls from Tanzanian, South African and African American study samples. Apart from confirming evidence of association at TXNRD2 (rs16984299; OR	 25693563 26432245 22761751 23128226 23741130 29361356 21532571 19225348 25861811 22064851 23963167 25173107 27571263 24974815 17572673 21565292 22143225 12029063 18852205 25518859 28530673 20616382 25722852 23940598 23535033 25027321 15297300 25669751 25637523 25173106 27225129 26139635 23500522 26752265 22955989 18477402 20835238 17701901 11815354 21167468 27548312 22570617 17273975 19543373
30323354	BRCA1/2-negative, high-risk breast cancers (BRCAX) for Asian women: genetic susceptibility loci and their potential impacts.	"BRCAX" refers breast cancers occurring in women with a family history predictive of being a BRCA1/2 mutation carrier, but BRCA1/2 genetic screening has failed to find causal mutations. In this study, we report the findings of the genetic architecture of BRCAX with novel and redefined candidate loci and their potential impacts on preventive strategy. We performed a genome-wide association study involving 1,469 BRCAX cases from the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer study, and high-risk breast cancer cases (1,482 Asians and 9,902 Europeans) from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We also evaluated the previously reported susceptibility loci for their roles in the high-risk breast cancers. We have identified three novel loci (PDE7B, UBL3, and a new independent marker in CDKN2B-AS1) associated with BRCAX, and replicated previously reported SNPs (24 of 92) and moderate/high-penetrance (seven of 23) genes for Korean BRCAX. For the novel candidate loci, evidence supported their roles in regulatory function. We estimated that the common low-penetrance loci might explain a substantial part of high-risk breast cancer (39.4% for Koreans and 24.0% for Europeans). Our study findings suggest that common genetic markers with lower penetrance constitute a part of susceptibility to high-risk breast cancers, with potential implications for a more comprehensive genetic screening test.	 18326623 16862161 22384356 24667084 23128226 19864262 22138821 17377060 22064851 24675953 11306344 21497495 27085081 22733233 11705483 22955616 28279062 23354978 10880551 25651787 25956309 23715323 21067532 27931260 23535825 12558355 19460581 29263802 23991967 25863477 20634204 20453838 22382806 17701901 19088722 19907646 17018785 20940738 23535729 26846999 19543373
30326835	Genetic variants in nuclear DNA along with environmental factors modify mitochondrial DNA copy number: a population-based exome-wide association study.	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been found associated with multiple diseases, including cancers, diabetes and so on. Both environmental and genetic factors could affect the copy number of mtDNA. However, limited study was available about the relationship between genetic variants and mtDNA copy number. What's more, most of previous studies considered only environmental or genetic factors. Therefore, it's necessary to explore the genetic effects on mtDNA copy number with the consideration of PM	 20176654 27707839 27648933 9073519 28185982 29020391 12600312 25977328 28768180 25240745 25377162 19264794 16424387 26672058 19862556 17468176 22005026 17237344 27158780 7593000 18664653 25976758 19073967 23611926 24973491 21640322 28688194 18376059 28486107 22264607 19553568 28599359 24899624 19838193 10644884 18481315 28911003 21725308 27806667 12198550 23251661 22916149 27023847 22885922 10914549 21859925 23684009 22563845 25889363 27171184
30325047	Identification and Replication of Six Loci Associated With Gallstone Disease.	Gallstone disease is a common complex disease that confers a substantial economic burden on society. The genetic underpinnings of gallstone disease remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify genetic associations with gallstone disease using publicly available data from the UK Biobank and two large Danish cohorts. We extracted genetic associations with gallstone disease from the Global Biobank Engine (GBE), an online browser of genome-wide associations in UK Biobank participants (14,940 cases and 322,268 controls). Significant associations (P < 5 × 10	
30327367	Genome-Wide Meta-analysis of Gene-Environmental Interaction for Insulin Resistance Phenotypes and Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Women.	Insulin resistance (IR)-related genetic variants are possibly associated with breast cancer, and the gene-phenotype-cancer association could be modified by lifestyle factors including obesity, physical inactivity, and high-fat diet. Using data from postmenopausal women, a population highly susceptible to obesity, IR, and increased risk of breast cancer, we implemented a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two steps: (1) GWAS meta-analysis of gene-environmental (i.e., behavioral) interaction (G*E) for IR phenotypes (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) and (2) after the G*E GWAS meta-analysis, the identified SNPs were tested for their associations with breast cancer risk in overall or subgroup population, where the SNPs were identified at genome-wide significance. We found 58 loci (55 novel SNPs; 5 index SNPs and 6 SNPs, independent of each other) that are associated with IR phenotypes in women overall or women stratified by obesity, physical activity, and high-fat diet; among those 58 loci, 29 (26 new loci; 2 index SNPs and 2 SNPs, independently) were associated with postmenopausal breast cancer. Our study suggests that a number of newly identified SNPs may have their effects on glucose intolerance by interplaying with obesity and other lifestyle factors, and a substantial proportion of these SNPs' susceptibility can also interact with the lifestyle factors to ultimately influence breast cancer risk. These findings may contribute to improved prediction accuracy for cancer and suggest potential intervention strategies for those women carrying genetic risk that will reduce their breast cancer risk.	
30336701	Genome-Wide Association Study Meta-Analysis of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in Two Population-Based Cohorts.	Alcohol use disorders are common conditions that have enormous social and economic consequences. Genome-wide association analyses were performed to identify genetic variants associated with a proxy measure of alcohol consumption and alcohol misuse and to explore the shared genetic basis between these measures and other substance use, psychiatric, and behavioral traits.	
30343302	High Genetic Risk Scores of ASIC2, MACROD2, CHRM3, and C2orf83 Genetic Variants Associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Impair Insulin Sensitivity and Interact with Energy Intake in Korean Women.	We explored the genetic variants that were associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by genome-wide association study (GWAS) and evaluated the association of genetic risk scores (GRS) of the selected genetic variants with insulin resistance and the interaction of the GRS with nutrient intake to develop insulin resistance.	
30431558	Genome-wide association reveals contribution of MRAS to painful temporomandibular disorder in males.	Painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are the leading cause of chronic orofacial pain, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Although many environmental factors have been associated with higher risk of developing painful TMD, family and twin studies support a heritable genetic component as well. We performed a genome-wide association study assuming an additive genetic model of TMD in a discovery cohort of 999 cases and 2031 TMD-free controls from the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study. Using logistic models adjusted for sex, age, enrollment site, and race, we identified 3 distinct loci that were significant in combined or sex-segregated analyses. A single-nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 3 (rs13078961) was significantly associated with TMD in males only (odds ratio = 2.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.02-4.27, P = 2.2 × 10). This association was nominally replicated in a meta-analysis of 7 independent orofacial pain cohorts including 160,194 participants (odds ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-1.35, P = 2.3 × 10). Functional analysis in human dorsal root ganglia and blood indicated this variant is an expression quantitative trait locus, with the minor allele associated with decreased expression of the nearby muscle RAS oncogene homolog (MRAS) gene (beta = -0.51, P = 2.43 × 10). Male mice, but not female mice, with a null mutation of Mras displayed persistent mechanical allodynia in a model of inflammatory pain. Genetic and behavioral evidence support a novel mechanism by which genetically determined MRAS expression moderates the resiliency to chronic pain. This effect is male-specific and may contribute to the lower rates of painful TMD in men.	
30423114	Genetic influences on susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in African-Americans.	Large meta-analyses of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility in European (EUR) and East Asian (EAS) populations have identified >100 RA risk loci, but genome-wide studies of RA in African-Americans (AAs) are absent. To address this disparity, we performed an analysis of 916 AA RA patients and 1392 controls and aggregated our data with genotyping data from >100 000 EUR and Asian RA patients and controls. We identified two novel risk loci that appear to be specific to AAs: GPC5 and RBFOX1 (PAA < 5 × 10-9). Most RA risk loci are shared across different ethnicities, but among discordant loci, we observed strong enrichment of variants having large effect sizes. We found strong evidence of effect concordance for only 3 of the 21 largest effect index variants in EURs. We used the trans-ethnic fine-mapping algorithm PAINTOR3 to prioritize risk variants in >90 RA risk loci. Addition of AA data to those of EUR and EAS descent enabled identification of seven novel high-confidence candidate pathogenic variants (defined by posterior probability > 0.8). In summary, our trans-ethnic analyses are the first to include AAs, identified several new RA risk loci and point to candidate pathogenic variants that may underlie this common autoimmune disease. These findings may lead to better ways to diagnose or stratify treatment approaches in RA.	
30429480	Novel pleiotropic risk loci for melanoma and nevus density implicate multiple biological pathways.	The total number of acquired melanocytic nevi on the skin is strongly correlated with melanoma risk. Here we report a meta-analysis of 11 nevus GWAS from Australia, Netherlands, UK, and USA comprising 52,506 individuals. We confirm known loci including MTAP, PLA2G6, and IRF4, and detect novel SNPs in KITLG and a region of 9q32. In a bivariate analysis combining the nevus results with a recent melanoma GWAS meta-analysis (12,874 cases, 23,203 controls), SNPs near GPRC5A, CYP1B1, PPARGC1B, HDAC4, FAM208B, DOCK8, and SYNE2 reached global significance, and other loci, including MIR146A and OBFC1, reached a suggestive level. Overall, we conclude that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk (KITLG an exception), while many melanoma risk loci do not alter nevus count. For example, variants in TERC and OBFC1 affect both traits, but other telomere length maintenance genes seem to affect melanoma risk only. Our findings implicate multiple pathways in nevogenesis.	 21270109 20602913 22507743 23201126 28625885 21478494 20086181 25231748 19340012 23301674 26091043 27459707 26688007 24258680 21565292 22155943 19578365 27347659 28094871 25545474 20616382 25803486 8277029 19710684 29739929 12783935 11511314 10417291 19803772 16433800 27182965 22216283 17627017 26740622 26857527 19464592 21407268 16899407 26237428 24470238 9472652 27125352 20647408 25621293 29022597

Fatty acid desaturases (FADS) catalyze the formation of unsaturated fatty acids and have been related to insulin sensitivity (IS). FADS activities differ between tissues and are influenced by genetic factors that may impact the link to IS.

30529582	Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study of East Asians Identifies Loci Associated With Risk for Colorectal Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated approximately 50 loci with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)-nearly one third of these loci were initially associated with CRC in studies conducted in East Asian populations. We conducted a GWAS of East Asians to identify CRC risk loci and evaluate the generalizability of findings from GWASs of European populations to Asian populations.	
30535121	Genome-wide association analyses identify 139 loci associated with macular thickness in the UK Biobank cohort.	The macula, located near the center of the retina in the human eye, is responsible for providing critical functions, such as central, sharp vision. Structural changes in the macula are associated with many ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. Although macular thickness is a highly heritable trait, there are no prior reported genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of it. Here we describe the first GWAS of macular thickness, which was measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography using 68 423 participants from the UK Biobank cohort. We identified 139 genetic loci associated with macular thickness at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). The most significant loci were LINC00461 (P = 5.1 × 10-120), TSPAN10 (P = 1.2 × 10-118), RDH5 (P = 9.2 × 10-105) and SLC6A20 (P = 1.4 × 10-71). Results from gene expression demonstrated that these genes are highly expressed in the retina. Other hits included many previously reported AMD genes, such as NPLOC4 (P = 1.7 × 10-103), RAD51B (P = 9.1 × 10-14) and SLC16A8 (P = 1.7 × 10-8), further providing functional significance of the identified loci. Through cross-phenotype analysis, these genetic loci also exhibited pleiotropic effects with myopia, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease), cancer (e.g. breast, ovarian and lung cancers) and metabolic traits (e.g. body mass index, waist circumference and type 2 diabetes). Our findings provide the first insight into the genetic architecture of macular thickness and may further elucidate the pathogenesis of related ocular diseases, such as AMD.	
30531935	Common-variant associations with fragile X syndrome.	Fragile X syndrome is rare but a prominent cause of intellectual disability. It is usually caused by a de novo mutation that occurs on multiple haplotypes and thus would not be expected to be detectible using genome-wide association (GWA). We conducted GWA in 89 male FXS cases and 266 male controls, and detected multiple genome-wide significant signals near FMR1 (odds ratio = 8.10, P = 2.5 × 10	
30531825	Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK Biobank explains most of the SNP heritability.	Natural hair colour within European populations is a complex genetic trait. Previous work has established that MC1R variants are the principal genetic cause of red hair colour, but with variable penetrance. Here, we have extensively mapped the genes responsible for hair colour in the white, British ancestry, participants in UK Biobank. MC1R only explains 73% of the SNP heritability for red hair in UK Biobank, and in fact most individuals with two MC1R variants have blonde or light brown hair. We identify other genes contributing to red hair, the combined effect of which accounts for ~90% of the SNP heritability. Blonde hair is associated with over 200 genetic variants and we find a continuum from black through dark and light brown to blonde and account for 73% of the SNP heritability of blonde hair. Many of the associated genes are involved in hair growth or texture, emphasising the cellular connections between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the determination of hair colour.	 18483556 18252222 22234890 22941192 23548203 20562875 20808728 17952075 9450927 23505390 25642630 24880339 24037378 26184321 29662168 20585627 21304890 24830394 14709592 18435620 19460173 22363655 20546537 18488028 9302268 25803486 19710684 20706415 18798982 26414676 20110278 7581459 29220522 23715323 18172690 18366057 25279928 26092688 24267888 26140449 24443471 19451168 20463881 20042077 21258399 25363779 30305743 18252221 9182807
30531953	Genome-wide mega-analysis identifies 16 loci and highlights diverse biological mechanisms in the common epilepsies.	The epilepsies affect around 65 million people worldwide and have a substantial missing heritability component. We report a genome-wide mega-analysis involving 15,212 individuals with epilepsy and 29,677 controls, which reveals 16 genome-wide significant loci, of which 11 are novel. Using various prioritization criteria, we pinpoint the 21 most likely epilepsy genes at these loci, with the majority in genetic generalized epilepsies. These genes have diverse biological functions, including coding for ion-channel subunits, transcription factors and a vitamin-B6 metabolism enzyme. Converging evidence shows that the common variants associated with epilepsy play a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the brain. The results show an enrichment for monogenic epilepsy genes as well as known targets of antiepileptic drugs. Using SNP-based heritability analyses we disentangle both the unique and overlapping genetic basis to seven different epilepsy subtypes. Together, these findings provide leads for epilepsy therapies based on underlying pathophysiology.	 26854917 29184056 28413689 25693563 28291836 29341109 28805813 25063994 26523775 19732765 29195078 20562875 17913586 17311295 27910877 25056061 25642630 25107880 24702672 15571515 27668389 21249183 23424107 7550350 28869584 22459682 24733163 23536187 17344885 29632380 28595657 22955616 26597089 29292387 26712538 28530673 20616382 24390342 27268795 22242659 22949513 16874892 28276062 18852200 14832012 28102150 25642633 20522523 21899536 7198743 26414678 26818399 20196795 21383325 25362483 25087078 27955713 27663502 22116939 27851967 22955989 27226047 29142228 9818842 28530675 18477402 17701901 26691988 21704546 26818947 26000319 27548312 16302871 23217325 22373907 24931665 24658933 28347857 29022597 29263209
30531941	GWAS identifies 14 loci for device-measured physical activity and sleep duration.	Physical activity and sleep duration are established risk factors for many diseases, but their aetiology is poorly understood, partly due to relying on self-reported evidence. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of device-measured physical activity and sleep duration in 91,105 UK Biobank participants, finding 14 significant loci (7 novel). These loci account for 0.06% of activity and 0.39% of sleep duration variation. Genome-wide estimates of ~ 15% phenotypic variation indicate high polygenicity. Heritability is higher in women than men for overall activity (23 vs. 20%, p = 1.5 × 10	 27990689 29184056 27992416 25826379 20631712 24473328 22818936 27936024 20562875 25597830 26955885 23525435 30305740 27475266 25642630 29073412 25550326 24642734 29784928 29545236 25660081 25885710 21088628 28146576 26773131 28599680 26833246 25260699 25722852 23754948 29040600 29892013 26414676 26464489 29030403 12493654 15654335 28976493 23415132 25642633 29846171 29149188 28604731 27225129 26414678 26569414 29899525 27306430 27663502 28693034 27494321 27899670 25673412 22426310 24114802 25673413 22818938 28114746 27061298 29632216 29155950 26050253 24500862 21300732 30305743 25469926 25954001
30541042	Agnostic Pathway/Gene Set Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Data Identifies Associations for Pancreatic Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify associations of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cancer risk but usually only explain a fraction of the inherited variability. Pathway analysis of genetic variants is a powerful tool to identify networks of susceptibility genes.	
30552173	Genetic variation at the glycosaminoglycan metabolism pathway contributes to the risk of psoriatic arthritis but not psoriasis.	Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting up to 30% of patients with psoriasis (Ps). To date, most of the known risk loci for PsA are shared with Ps, and identifying disease-specific variation has proven very challenging. The objective of the present study was to identify genetic variation specific for PsA.	
30552108	Genome-Wide Association Study Confirming a Strong Effect of HLA and Identifying Variants in 	The first genome-wide association study of fulminant type 1 diabetes was performed in Japanese individuals. As previously reported using a candidate gene approach, a strong association was observed with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region, and the strongest association was observed with rs9268853 in the class II DR region (	
30556296	A case-control genome wide association study of substance use disorder (SUD) identifies novel variants on chromosome 7p14.1 in patients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).	Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have provided insights into the molecular basis of the disorder in different population. This study presents the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) in patients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The aim was to identify genetic association(s) that may provide insights into the molecular basis of the disorder. The GWAS discovery cohort consisted of 512 (250 cases and 262 controls) male participants from the UAE. Controls with no prior history of SUD were available from the Emirates family registry. The replication cohort consisted of 520 (415 cases and 105 controls) Australian male Caucasian participants. The GWAS discovery samples were genotyped for 4.6 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The replication cohort was genotyped using TaqMan assay. The GWAS association analysis identified three potential SNPs rs118129027 (p-value = 6.24 × 10	
30557370	Genome wide association study to identify predictors for severe skin toxicity in colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab.	EGFR-antibodies are associated with significant skin toxicity, including acneiform rash and folliculitis. It remains impossible to predict the occurrence of severe skin toxicity due to the lack of predictive markers. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicity using data of the multicentre randomized phase III CAIRO2 trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00208546). In this study, advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab with or without cetuximab. Germline DNA was available in 282 of the 368 patients in the cetuximab arm. Mild skin toxicity occurred in 195 patients (i.e. CTC grade 1 or 2, respectively 91 and 104 patients) and severe skin toxicity (i.e. grade 3) in 36 patients. Grade 4 skin toxicity did not occur. None of the SNPs reached the formal genome wide threshold for significance of 5x10(-8), though SNPs of at least 8 loci did show moderate association (p-value between 5x10(-7) and 5x10(-5)) with the occurrence of grade 3 (severe) skin toxicity. These SNPs did not overlap with SNPs associated with cetuximab efficacy as found in a previous GWAS in the same CAIRO2 cohort. If formally proven by replication, the SNPs associated with severe EGFR induced skin toxicity may be helpful to predict the occurrence and severity of skin toxicity in patients that will receive cetuximab and allow for adequate information on the risk of skin toxicity and prophylactic measurements.	
30557369	Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ovarian cancer in Japanese predicted regulatory variants in 22q13.1.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified greater than 30 variants associated with ovarian cancer, but most of these variants were investigated in European populations. Here, we integrated GWAS and subsequent functional analyses to identify the genetic variants with potential regulatory effects. We conducted GWAS for ovarian cancer using 681 Japanese cases and 17,492 controls and found that rs137672 on 22q13.1 exhibited a strong association with a P-value of 1.05 × 10(-7) and an odds ratio of 0.573 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.466-0.703. In addition, three previously reported SNPs, i.e., rs10088218, rs9870207 and rs1400482, were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as noted in previous studies. Functional studies including regulatory feature analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed two regulatory SNPs in 22q13.1, rs2072872 and rs6509, that affect the binding affinity to some nuclear proteins in ovarian cancer cells. The plausible regulatory proteins whose motifs could be affected by the allele changes of these two SNPs were also proposed. Moreover, the protective G allele of rs6509 was associated with a decreased SYNGR1 expression level in normal ovarian tissues. Our findings elucidated the regulatory variants in 22q13.1 that are associated with ovarian cancer risk.	
30563984	A case-control genome-wide association study of ADHD discovers a novel association with the tenascin R (TNR) gene.	It is well-established that there is a strong genetic contribution to the aetiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, we employed a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study (GWAS) design in a sample of 480 clinical childhood ADHD cases and 1208 controls to search for novel genetic risk loci for ADHD. DNA was genotyped using Illumina's Human Infinium PsychArray-24v1.2., and the data were subsequently imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Rigorous quality control and pruning of genotypes at both individual subject and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) levels was performed. Polygenic risk score (PGRS) analysis revealed that ADHD case-control status was explained by genetic risk for ADHD, but no other major psychiatric disorders. Logistic regression analysis was performed genome-wide to test the association between SNPs and ADHD case-control status. We observed a genome-wide significant association (p = 3.15E-08) between ADHD and rs6686722, mapped to the Tenascin R (TNR) gene. Members of this gene family are extracellular matrix glycoproteins that play a role in neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. Suggestive evidence of associations with ADHD was observed for an additional 111 SNPs (⩽9.91E-05). Although intriguing, the association between DNA variation in the TNR gene and ADHD should be viewed as preliminary given the small sample size of this discovery dataset.	
30631343	Associations Between Genetic Data and Quantitative Assessment of Normal Facial Asymmetry.	Human facial asymmetry is due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. To identify genetic influences on facial asymmetry, we developed a method for automated scoring that summarizes local morphology features and their spatial distribution. A genome-wide association study using asymmetry scores from two local symmetry features was conducted and significant genetic associations were identified for one asymmetry feature, including genes thought to play a role in craniofacial disorders and development: 	
30566500	Large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis of polycystic ovary syndrome suggests shared genetic architecture for different diagnosis criteria.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed based on the two criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a fixed-effect, inverse-weighted-variance meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Only one locus differed significantly in its association by diagnostic criteria; otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or non-NIH Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis revealed genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. The data thus demonstrate 3 novel loci associated with PCOS and similar genetic architecture for all diagnostic criteria. The data also provide the first genetic evidence for a male phenotype for PCOS and a causal link to depression, a previously hypothesized comorbid disease. Thus, the genetics provide a comprehensive view of PCOS that encompasses multiple diagnostic criteria, gender, reproductive potential and mental health.	
30566433	A variant within the FTO confers susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.	To explore novel genetic loci for diabetic nephropathy, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. We analyzed the association of 5,768,242 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 2,380 nephropathy cases and 5,234 controls. We further performed GWAS for diabetic nephropathy using independent Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 429 cases and 358 controls and the results of these two GWAS were combined with an inverse variance meta-analysis (stage-1), followed by a de novo genotyping for the candidate SNP loci (p < 1.0 × 10(-4)) in an independent case-control study (Stage-2; 1,213 cases and 1,298 controls). After integrating stage-1 and stage-2 data, we identified one SNP locus, significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy; rs56094641 in FTO, P = 7.74 × 10(-10). We further examined the association of rs56094641 with diabetic nephropathy in independent Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (902 cases and 1,221 controls), and found that the association of this locus with diabetic nephropathy remained significant after integrating all association data (P = 7.62 × 10(-10)). We have identified FTO locus as a novel locus for conferring susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.	
30573655	Genome-wide meta-analysis reveals shared new 	Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are heterogeneous and complex conditions with overlapping clinical symptoms and elevated familial aggregation, which suggests the existence of a shared genetic component. In order to identify this genetic background in a systematic fashion, we performed the first cross-disease genome-wide meta-analysis in systemic seropositive rheumatic diseases, namely, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.	
30583798	GWAS Identifies Risk Locus for Erectile Dysfunction and Implicates Hypothalamic Neurobiology and Diabetes in Etiology.	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition affecting more than 20% of men over 60 years, yet little is known about its genetic architecture. We performed a genome-wide association study of ED in 6,175 case subjects among 223,805 European men and identified one locus at 6q16.3 (lead variant rs57989773, OR 1.20 per C-allele; p = 5.71 × 10	
30583557	The Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPL) Locus Is Associated with B6 Vitamer Levels in CSF and Plasma.	The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), is essential for human metabolism. The brain is dependent on vitamin B6 for its neurotransmitter balance. To obtain insight into the genetic determinants of vitamin B6 homeostasis, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the B6 vitamers pyridoxal (PL), PLP and the degradation product of vitamin B6, pyridoxic acid (PA). We collected a unique sample set of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from the same healthy human subjects of Dutch ancestry (	
30593799	Multi-Ancestry Genome-Wide Association Study of Spontaneous Clearance of Hepatitis C Virus.	Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs in approximately 30% of infected persons and less often in populations of African ancestry. Variants in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and in interferon lambda genes are associated with spontaneous HCV clearance, but there have been few studies of these variants in persons of African ancestry. We performed a dense multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of spontaneous clearance of HCV, focusing on individuals of African ancestry.	
30595370	Leveraging Polygenic Functional Enrichment to Improve GWAS Power.	Functional genomics data has the potential to increase GWAS power by identifying SNPs that have a higher prior probability of association. Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9%-38% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N = 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.	
30595539	Genetic influence on scar height and pliability after burn injury in individuals of European ancestry: A prospective cohort study.	After similar extent of injury there is considerable variability in scarring between individuals, in part due to genetic factors. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with scar height and pliability after burn injury. An exome-wide array association study and gene pathway analysis were performed on a prospective cohort of 665 patients treated for burn injury. Outcomes were scar height (SH) and scar pliability (SP) sub-scores of the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS). DNA was genotyped using the Infinium	
30589442	Biomarker and Genomic Risk Factors for Liver Function Test Abnormality in Hazardous Drinkers.	Alcohol dependence and long-term excessive alcohol use may cause liver damage, but only some patients develop cirrhosis. Similarly, high alcohol intake without evident liver disease often but not always produces abnormal enzymatic liver function tests (LFTs), particularly gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). We postulate that the factors predisposing to cirrhosis in alcoholics and to liver enzyme abnormality in drinkers are similar, and that biochemical LFTs could therefore be useful as markers of risk of alcoholic liver disease in excessive drinkers.	
30593698	Genomics of body fat percentage may contribute to sex bias in anorexia nervosa.	Anorexia nervosa (AN) occurs nine times more often in females than in males. Although environmental factors likely play a role, the reasons for this imbalanced sex ratio remain unresolved. AN displays high genetic correlations with anthropometric and metabolic traits. Given sex differences in body composition, we investigated the possible metabolic underpinnings of female propensity for AN. We conducted sex-specific GWAS in a healthy and medication-free subsample of the UK Biobank (n = 155,961), identifying 77 genome-wide significant loci associated with body fat percentage (BF%) and 174 with fat-free mass (FFM). Partitioned heritability analysis showed an enrichment for central nervous tissue-associated genes for BF%, which was more prominent in females than males. Genetic correlations of BF% and FFM with the largest GWAS of AN by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were estimated to explore shared genomics. The genetic correlations of BF%	
30598549	An atlas of genetic influences on osteoporosis in humans and mice.	Osteoporosis is a common aging-related disease diagnosed primarily using bone mineral density (BMD). We assessed genetic determinants of BMD as estimated by heel quantitative ultrasound in 426,824 individuals, identifying 518 genome-wide significant loci (301 novel), explaining 20% of its variance. We identified 13 bone fracture loci, all associated with estimated BMD (eBMD), in ~1.2 million individuals. We then identified target genes enriched for genes known to influence bone density and strength (maximum odds ratio (OR) = 58, P = 1 × 10	
30610941	Genome-wide association study in two populations to determine genetic variants associated with Toxoplasma gondii infection and relationship to schizophrenia risk.	T. gondii (TOXO) infects over one billion people worldwide, yet the literature lacks a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) focused on genetic variants controlling the persistence of TOXO infection. To identify putative T. gondii susceptibility genes, we performed a GWAS using IgG seropositivity as the outcome variable in a discovery sample (n = 790) from an Ashkenazi dataset, and a second sample of predominately African Americans (The Grady Trauma Project, n = 285). We also performed a meta-analyses of the 2 cohorts. None of the SNPs in these analyses was statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. In the Ashkenazi population, the gene region of CHIA (chitinase) showed the most nominally significant association with TOXO. Prior studies have shown that the production of chitinase by macrophages in the brain responding to TOXO infection is crucial for controlling the burden of T. gondii cysts. We found a surprising number of genes involved in neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders among our top hits even though our outcome variable was TOXO infection. In the meta-analysis combining the Ashkenazi and Grady Trauma Project samples, there was enrichment for genes implicated in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (p < .05). Upon limiting our sample to those without mental illness, two schizophrenia related genes (CNTNAP2, GABAR2) still had significant TOXO-associated variants at the p < .05 level, but did not pass the genome wide significance threshold after correction for multiple comparisons. Using Ingenuity Systems molecular network analysis, we identified molecular nodes suggesting that while different genetic variants associated with TOXO in the two population samples, the molecular pathways for TOXO susceptibility nevertheless converged on common pathways. Molecular nodes in these common pathways included NOTCH1, CD44, and RXRA. Prior studies show that CD44 participates in TOXO-induced immunopathology and that RXRA is instrumental in regulating T-helper immune responses. These data provide new insights into the pathophysiology of this common neurotropic parasite.	
30617275	Meta-analysis of up to 622,409 individuals identifies 40 novel smoking behaviour associated genetic loci.	Smoking is a major heritable and modifiable risk factor for many diseases, including cancer, common respiratory disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Fourteen genetic loci have previously been associated with smoking behaviour-related traits. We tested up to 235,116 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the exome-array for association with smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, pack-years, and smoking cessation in a fixed effects meta-analysis of up to 61 studies (up to 346,813 participants). In a subset of 112,811 participants, a further one million SNVs were also genotyped and tested for association with the four smoking behaviour traits. SNV-trait associations with P < 5 × 10	
30617256	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r	
30867560	Genetic contributions to two special factors of neuroticism are associated with affluence, higher intelligence, better health, and longer life.	Higher scores on the personality trait of neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions, are associated with worse mental and physical health. Studies examining links between neuroticism and health typically operationalize neuroticism by summing the items from a neuroticism scale. However, neuroticism is made up of multiple heterogeneous facets, each contributing to the effect of neuroticism as a whole. A recent study showed that a 12-item neuroticism scale described one broad trait of general neuroticism and two special factors, one characterizing the extent to which people worry and feel vulnerable, and the other characterizing the extent to which people are anxious and tense. This study also found that, although individuals who were higher on general neuroticism lived shorter lives, individuals whose neuroticism was characterized by worry and vulnerability lived longer lives. Here, we examine the genetic contributions to the two special factors of neuroticism-anxiety/tension and worry/vulnerability-and how they contrast with that of general neuroticism. First, we show that, whereas the polygenic load for neuroticism is associated with the genetic risk of coronary artery disease, lower intelligence, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and poorer self-rated health, the genetic variants associated with high levels of anxiety/tension, and high levels of worry/vulnerability are associated with genetic variants linked to higher SES, higher intelligence, better self-rated health, and longer life. Second, we identify genetic variants that are uniquely associated with these protective aspects of neuroticism. Finally, we show that different neurological pathways are linked to each of these neuroticism phenotypes.	
30886212	Genome-wide association analysis reveals KCTD12 and miR-383-binding genes in the background of rumination.	Ruminative response style is a passive and repetitive way of responding to stress, associated with several disorders. Although twin and candidate gene studies have proven the genetic underpinnings of rumination, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been conducted yet. We performed a GWAS on ruminative response style and its two subtypes, brooding and reflection, among 1758 European adults recruited in the general population of Budapest, Hungary, and Manchester, United Kingdom. We evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based, gene-based and gene set-based tests, together with inferences on genes regulated by our most significant SNPs. While no genome-wide significant hit emerged at the SNP level, the association of rumination survived correction for multiple testing with KCTD12 at the gene level, and with the set of genes binding miR-383 at the gene set level. SNP-level results were concordant between the Budapest and Manchester subsamples for all three rumination phenotypes. SNP-level results and their links to brain expression levels based on external databases supported the role of KCTD12, SRGAP3, and SETD5 in rumination, CDH12 in brooding, and DPYSL5, MAPRE3, KCNK3, ATXN7L3B, and TPH2 in reflection, among others. The relatively low sample size is a limitation of our study. Results of the first GWAS on rumination identified genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders underscoring the transdiagnostic nature of rumination, and pointed to the possible role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in this cognitive process.	
30888730	Meta-Analysis of Genomewide Association Studies Reveals Genetic Variants for Hip Bone Geometry.	Hip geometry is an important predictor of fracture. We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS studies in adults to identify genetic variants that are associated with proximal femur geometry phenotypes. We analyzed four phenotypes: (i) femoral neck length; (ii) neck-shaft angle; (iii) femoral neck width, and (iv) femoral neck section modulus, estimated from DXA scans using algorithms of hip structure analysis. In the Discovery stage, 10 cohort studies were included in the fixed-effect meta-analysis, with up to 18,719 men and women ages 16 to 93 years. Association analyses were performed with ∼2.5 million polymorphisms under an additive model adjusted for age, body mass index, and height. Replication analyses of meta-GWAS significant loci (at adjusted genomewide significance [GWS], threshold p ≤ 2.6 × 10	
30899065	A genome-wide association study on photic sneeze reflex in the Chinese population.	Photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is an interesting but yet mysterious phenotype featured by individuals' response of sneezing in exposure to bright light. To uncover the underlying genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted exclusively in a Chinese population of 3417 individuals (PSR prevalence at 25.6%), and reproducibly identified both a replicative rs10427255 on 2q22.3 and a novel locus of rs1032507 on 3p12.1 in various effect models (additive, as well as dominant and recessive). Minor alleles respectively contributed to increased or reduced risk for PSR with odds ratio (95% confidence interval) at 1.68 ([1.50, 1.88]) for rs10427255 and 0.65 ([0.58, 0.72]) for rs1032507. The two independent SNPs were intergenic, and collectively enhanced PSR classification by lifting the area-under-curve value in ROC curve to 0.657. Together with previous GWAS in other populations, the result substantiated the polygenic and non-ethnicity-specific nature behind the PSR phenotype.	
30895295	A Genome-Wide Association Study of Skin and Iris Pigmentation among Individuals of South Asian Ancestry.	South Asia has a complex history of migrations and is characterized by substantial pigmentary and genetic diversity. For this reason, it is an ideal region to study the genetic architecture of normal pigmentation variation. Here, we present a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of skin pigmentation using skin reflectance (M-index) as a quantitative phenotype. The meta-analysis includes a sample of individuals of South Asian descent living in Canada (N = 348), and a sample of individuals from two caste and four tribal groups from West Maharashtra, India (N = 480). We also present the first GWAS of iris color in South Asian populations. This GWAS was based on quantitative measures of iris color obtained from high-resolution iris pictures. We identified genome-wide significant associations of variants within the well-known gene SLC24A5, including the nonsynonymous rs1426654 polymorphism, with both skin pigmentation and iris color, highlighting the pleiotropic effects of this gene on pigmentation. Variants in the HERC2 gene (e.g., rs12913832) were also associated with iris color and iris heterochromia. Our study emphasizes the usefulness of quantitative methods to study iris color variation. We also identified novel genome-wide significant associations with skin pigmentation and iris color, but we could not replicate these associations due to the lack of independent samples. It will be critical to expand the number of studies in South Asian populations in order to better understand the genetic variation driving the diversity of skin pigmentation and iris color observed in this region.	
30911093	Genome-wide association study of blood lipids in Indians confirms universality of established variants.	Lipids foster energy production and their altered levels have been coupled with metabolic ailments. Indians feature high prevalence of metabolic diseases, yet uncharacterized for genes regulating lipid homeostasis. We performed first GWAS for quantitative lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) exclusively in 5271 Indians. Further to corroborate our genetic findings, we investigated DNA methylation marks in peripheral blood in Indians at the identified loci (N = 233) and retrieved gene regulatory features from public domains. Recurrent GWAS loci-CELSR2, CETP, LPL, ZNF259, and BUD13 cropped up as lead signals in Indians, reflecting their universal applicability. Besides established variants, we found certain unreported variants at sub-genome-wide level-QKI, REEP3, TMCC2, FAM129C, FAM241B, and LOC100506207. These variants though failed to attain GWAS significance in Indians, but largely turned out to be active CpG sites in human subcutaneous adipose tissue and showed robust association to two or more lipid traits. Of which, QKI variants showed significant association to all four lipid traits and their designated region was observed to be a key gene regulatory segment denoting active transcription particularly in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Both established and novel loci were observed to be significantly associated with altered DNA methylation in Indians for specific CpGs that resided in key regulatory elements. Further, gene-based association analysis pinpointed novel GWAS loci-LINC01340 and IQCJ-SCHIP1 for TC; IFT27, IFT88, and LINC02141 for HDL; and TEX26 for TG. Present study ascertains universality of selected known genes and also identifies certain novel loci for lipids in Indians by integrating data from various levels of gene regulation.	
30926877	Genome-wide association analysis suggests novel loci underlying thyroid antibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.	Thyroid antibodies against thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are key markers of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), the most common autoimmune thyroid disorder. Genetic determinants of thyroid antibodies are still poorly known, especially as they were not studied in patients with thyroid diseases. We performed the first genome-wide association analysis of thyroid antibodies in 430 HT patients that may be considered as population extremes for thyroid antibodies distribution. We detected two suggestively associated genetic variants with TgAb, rs6972286 close to ANKRD7 and LSM8 (P = 2.34 × 10	
30993211	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies multiple novel loci associated with serum uric acid levels in Japanese individuals.	Gout is a common arthritis caused by elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Here we investigated loci influencing SUA in a genome-wide meta-analysis with 121,745 Japanese subjects. We identified 8948 variants at 36 genomic loci (	
30975718	Novel Risk Loci Identified in a Genome-Wide Association Study of Urolithiasis in a Japanese Population.	A family history of urolithiasis is associated with a more than doubling of urolithiasis risk, and a twin study estimating 56% heritability of the condition suggests a pivotal role for host genetic factors. However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only six risk-related loci.	
30980028	The molecular genetics of hand preference revisited.	Hand preference is a prominent behavioural trait linked to human brain asymmetry. A handful of genetic variants have been reported to associate with hand preference or quantitative measures related to it. Most of these reports were on the basis of limited sample sizes, by current standards for genetic analysis of complex traits. Here we performed a genome-wide association analysis of hand preference in the large, population-based UK Biobank cohort (N = 331,037). We used gene-set enrichment analysis to investigate whether genes involved in visceral asymmetry are particularly relevant to hand preference, following one previous report. We found no evidence supporting any of the previously suggested variants or genes, nor that genes involved in visceral laterality have a role in hand preference. It remains possible that some of the previously reported genes or pathways are relevant to hand preference as assessed in other ways, or else are relevant within specific disorder populations. However, some or all of the earlier findings are likely to be false positives, and none of them appear relevant to hand preference as defined categorically in the general population. Our analysis did produce a small number of novel, significant associations, including one implicating the microtubule-associated gene MAP2 in handedness.	
30995994	Multivariate genome-wide association study of rapid automatised naming and rapid alternating stimulus in Hispanic American and African-American youth.	Rapid automatised naming (RAN) and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) are reliable predictors of reading disability. The underlying biology of reading disability is poorly understood. However, the high correlation among RAN, RAS and reading could be attributable to shared genetic factors that contribute to common biological mechanisms.	
31015462	Sex-specific and pleiotropic effects underlying kidney function identified from GWAS meta-analysis.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health burden currently affecting 10-15% of adults worldwide. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. We analyze eGFR data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and Michigan Genomics Initiative and perform a GWAS meta-analysis with public summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identify 147 loci (53 novel) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Additionally, sex-stratified analysis identifies one locus with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD with only modest improvements in detection compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD.	
31059154	Genome-wide survey of copy number variants finds MAPT duplications in progressive supranuclear palsy.	Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative tauopathy manifesting clinically as a progressive akinetic-rigid syndrome. In this study, we sought to identify genetic variants influencing PSP susceptibility through a genome-wide association analysis of a cohort of well-characterized patients who had participated in the Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes and Blood Brain Barrier in Parkinson Plus Syndromes studies.	
31065058	GBA and APOE ε4 associate with sporadic dementia with Lewy bodies in European genome wide association study.	Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with poor prognosis and mainly unknown pathophysiology. Heritability estimates exceed 30% but few genetic risk variants have been identified. Here we investigated common genetic variants associated with DLB in a large European multisite sample. We performed a genome wide association study in Norwegian and European cohorts of 720 DLB cases and 6490 controls and included 19 top-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in an additional cohort of 108 DLB cases and 75545 controls from Iceland. Overall the study included 828 DLB cases and 82035 controls. Variants in the ASH1L/GBA (Chr1q22) and APOE ε4 (Chr19) loci were associated with DLB surpassing the genome-wide significance threshold (p < 5 × 10	
31081985	Genome-wide analyses of psychological resilience in U.S. Army soldiers.	Though a growing body of preclinical and translational research is illuminating a biological basis for resilience to stress, little is known about the genetic basis of psychological resilience in humans. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of self-assessed (by questionnaire) and outcome-based (incident mental disorders from predeployment to postdeployment) resilience among European (EUR) ancestry soldiers in the Army study to assess risk and resilience in servicemembers. Self-assessed resilience (N = 11,492) was found to have significant common-variant heritability (h	
31092297	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci for type 2 diabetes-attributed end-stage kidney disease in African Americans.	End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a significant public health concern disproportionately affecting African Americans (AAs). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of ESKD in the USA, and efforts to uncover genetic susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) have had limited success. A prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AAs with T2D-ESKD was expanded with additional AA cases and controls and genotypes imputed to the higher density 1000 Genomes reference panel. The discovery analysis included 3432 T2D-ESKD cases and 6977 non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls (N = 10,409), followed by a discrimination analysis in 2756 T2D non-nephropathy controls to exclude T2D-associated variants.	
31109976	Genomewide Association Study Confirming the Association of 	Antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is a common side effect leading to tuberculosis (TB) treatment disruption. The mechanism of the disease remains poorly understood. We conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) to investigate all possible genetic factors of ATDILI in Thai patients. This study was carried out in Thai TB patients, including 79 ATDILI cases and 239 tolerant controls from our network hospitals in Thailand. Nearly 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped across the whole genome using an Illumina OmniExpress Exome BeadChip array. In the discovery stage, we identified strong association signals on chromosome 8 originating from the
